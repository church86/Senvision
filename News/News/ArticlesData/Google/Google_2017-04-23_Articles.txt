Facebook, Twitter, Google and other websites' ways of dealing with the problem should come together, according to EU, reported Reuters. There is a "high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content - be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights," the Europian Commission says in a draft policy paper. "Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases, they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda)." The commission also informed that it will come up with legislative and/or non-legislative measures by the end of this year to address "legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms". Just about last year Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube agreed to an EU code of conduct, under which they agreed to tackle online hate speeches within 24 hours. Lately, the tech companies have been under increasing pressure to tackle this problem fast and smooth. However, as per the tech companies its difficult because they are not liable for what the users post, but it's their duty to take down if something gets reported as illegal. The draft policy paper says that EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. "The Commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem." As per Reuters, one EU official stated that the Commission was considering to adopt so-called "good Samaritan" principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their websites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. Last month Germany introduced a law, according to which social media companies can be fined up to $53.62 million, if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over?

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years?

Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ...

It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off.

Rohit KVN   April 24, 2017 10:51 IST Google Doodle honours Dr. Rajkumar (Annavru) on his 88th birthday; Here's 10 things to know about Kannada matinee idolGoogle Doodle (Screen-shot) To mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Rajkumar, search engine giant Google has dedicated a doodle depicting the Kannada matinee idol's painting on its page on Monday. Dr. Rajkumar, popularly known as Annavru (big brother) in Karnataka, is a highly regarded actor in Sandalwood (Kannada film industry). Some of his best movies include Gandhada Gudi, Mayura, Shankar Guru, Keralida Simha in 1981, Shravana Banthu, Adhe Kannu, Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma and Aakasmika. He is the only lead Indian actor to have won National Film award for best playback singer (Naadamaya for Jeevana Chakra). He has also received several more honours in his film career spanning more than 50 years.

Dr. Rajkumar original name is Singanalluru Puttaswamayya Muthuraju. He was bestowed with the stage name as Rajkumar by H. L. N. Simha, who also offered him the first lead actor position for the film Bedara Kannapa, and the rest, as they say, is history. Besides Annavru, Dr. Rajkumar's holds several other titles, which includes Nata Saarvabhouma (Emperor of Actors), Bangarada Manushya (Man of Gold), Vara Nata (Gifted Actor) and Rajanna (Brother Raj). Dr. Rajkumar has acted in 206 movies, excluding special appearances and that too he acted only in Kannada language. Besides his acclaimed film career, Dr. Rajkumar is also know for spearheading Karnataka's biggest mass movement Gokak Chaluvalli, which forced government to bring in big reforms including making Kannada a compulsory language of education in Karnataka. For this outstanding contribution towards the movie and arts, he was honoured with India's highest award in cinema, Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1995. He is also India's first cinema artist to be awarded with honorary Doctorate (by Mysore University). Dr. Rajkumar has been bestowed with several stagename by fans, and he returned the favour by honouring them as "Abhimaani Devarugalu"(Fan Gods) and also termed movie producers as "Anna Daataru" (food providers) showing his humbleness. During his cinema career, Dr. Rajkumar has received eleven Karnataka State Film Awards, ten South Filmfare Awards, two National Film Awards and a National Film Award for Best Playback Singer for song "Naadamaya". He also received the NTR National Award in 2002. Dr. Rajkumar was once kidnapped by the infamous elephant tusk and sandalwood smuggler Veerappan. He was held in captive for more than 100 days and led to state-wide protest over the government's ineffective measures to bring back the matinee idol. Although Dr. Rajkumar eventually was released, how the government secured his release still remains a mystery. Dr. Rajkumar passed away on April 12, 2006 due to cardiac arrest. His family later donated the actor's eyes. Related Earth Day 2017: Why is it observed, what is the theme this year and how is Google creating awareness?

Name: Subject: Message: An introduction to Firebase – the easiest way to build powerful, cloud-enabled Android apps Android Developmentby Adam Sinicki1 hour ago Google I/O 2017 is rapidly approaching and taking a look at the scheduled sessions, it’s apparent that Firebase will be featuring heavily. This is something of a clue as to how Google views Firebase. In short: it’s kind of a big deal. And Google is right to want to promote the service. Firebase is a tool that allows us to make cloud-enabled apps quickly and easily, which opens up a huge number of opportunities. Normally, when a friend tells me they have an idea for an app, it will almost always involve a strong social element. Historically, I would have balked that this is probably the most difficult kind of app for a newbie to make, even though it is undoubtedly also the kind that most people are interested in. Thanks to Firebase, making this kind of app is not only possible for a beginner but also relatively easy. Though relative is certainly the operative word there… See also: Create an error-free Android app, with Firebase crash reporting 6 days ago So, what exactly is Firebase? What uses does it offer the Android developer? And how do you get started? What is Firebase? Firebase is a mobile platform from Google offering a number of different features that you can pick ‘n mix from. Specifically, these features revolve around cloud services, allowing users to save and retrieve data to be accessed from any device or browser. This can be useful for such things as cloud messaging, hosting, crash reporting, notifications, analytics and even earning money through AdMob – which I discussed in a previous post. In short, Firebase handles the backend online element for your apps, allowing you to focus on the front-end UI and functionality. All this is done through a single SDK with easy-to-use APIs and excellent integration into Android Studio. This removes the need to create your own server-side script using PHP and MySQL, or a similar set-up. This is ‘Backend as a Service’ or ‘BaaS’, and essentially this means that anyone really can make that ambitious social app. It works with Android apps, iOS apps and web apps and best of all: it’s free! Are there any reasons not to use Firebase? Sure. One downside of Firebase is that it means relying on a third-party solution. If Google should ever abandon Firebase, then you’d be forced to migrate your data and rebuild your app, which could be quite a headache. It seems unlikely right now, but it’s something you should always keep in mind. It works with Android apps, iOS apps and web apps and best of all: it’s free! Another potential concern is that this is that Firebase uses a real-time database and all data is automatically synchronised across all users – rather than being stored on the phone first and then ‘sent’. While this certainly has advantages, it means that an internet connection is necessary at all times for your app to work. For the most part though, this is a fantastically powerful and versatile way to build cloud-enabled apps and is something that every Android developer should familiarise themselves with. Setting up a project Before you can do anything with Firebase, you first need to create an account. You can do this over at firebase.google.com. Once you’ve done that, you’ll be taken to the ‘console’. Here you’ll see any projects you’ve previously created and you’ll have the opportunity to add new ones. Previously, we would have had to do this manually, which would involve downloading a JSON file, updating Gradle build files and more. The good news is that Firebase has evolved and we can now do everything from within Android Studio itself. So, create a new app project in Android Studio and then choose Tools > Firebase to open up the ‘Firebase Assistant’ in a window on the right of the IDE. Now click ‘Connect’. A browser window will open up for you to sign into your account and then the project will be created automatically. I called my app ‘Firebase Example’ and if I now head back to the Firebase console, I can see  the project has been created automatically. Click on it to open the project console. Authentication The simplicity continues. To begin adding Firebase Authentication just click ‘Add Firebase Authentication to your app’. This will add a number of dependencies to your Gradle files, so just click ‘Accept Changes’. You’ll need to do this each time you want to use a new feature from Firebase. See also: Add Facebook and Twitter authentication to your apps, using Firebase and Fabric March 21, 2017   Unfortunately, the next step is going to require some actual code on our part. The good news is that all the code you’ll need is actually provided by Google and can be copied and pasted directly from the Assistant. I’ve made just a couple of changes so it will be completely ready to run.. First, we declare the FirebaseAuth and AuthStateListener objects in MainActivity.java like so: private FirebaseAuth mAuth;
private FirebaseAuth.AuthStateListener mAuthListener; Don’t forget to import the relevant classes. Just click the red underlined text and press Alt + Enter to do this automatically. You’ll need to repeat this as you paste in more of the code that follows. Now in the onCreate() method, add the following code to initialize the FirebaseAuth instance and AuthStateListener method: mAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();
mAuthListener = new FirebaseAuth.AuthStateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onAuthStateChanged(@NonNull FirebaseAuth firebaseAuth) {
        FirebaseUser user = firebaseAuth.getCurrentUser();
        if (user != null) {
            // User is signed in
            Log.d("Main Activity", "onAuthStateChanged:signed_in:" + user.getUid());
        } else {
            // User is signed out
            Log.d("Main Activity", "onAuthStateChanged:signed_out");
        }
        // ...
    }
}; Then attach the listener to the FirebaseAuth instance in onStart. We will remove it in onStop:     @Override
    public void onStart(){
        super.onStart();
        mAuth.addAuthStateListener(mAuthListener);
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        if (mAuthListener != null) {
            mAuth.removeAuthStateListener(mAuthListener);
        }
    } Now that’s all ready, we can create a method to add new users! Following along with Google’s instructions, we’ll call this method createAccount. It should look like so:     private void createAccount() {
        mAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword("example@email.com", "password")
        .addOnCompleteListener(this, new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
                Log.d("Main Activity", "createUserWithEmail:onComplete:" + task.isSuccessful());

                // If sign in fails, display a message to the user. If sign in succeeds
                // the auth state listener will be notified and logic to handle the
                // signed in user can be handled in the listener.
                if (!task.isSuccessful()) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Authentication failed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            }
        });
    } Now we can sign in our existing users with another, similar method:     private void signInAccount() {
        mAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword("example@email.com", "password")
        .addOnCompleteListener(this, new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
                Log.d("Main Activity", "signInWithEmail:onComplete:" + task.isSuccessful());

                // If sign in fails, display a message to the user. If sign in succeeds
                // the auth state listener will be notified and logic to handle the
                // signed in user can be handled in the listener.
                if (!task.isSuccessful()) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Authentication failed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            }
        });
    } Right, so let’s actually try using all this shall we? To do that, all we need to do is try running those two methods. At the bottom of onCreate(), add createAccount(); and signInAccount();. Normally, we would pass strings for the email and password which we would acquire through some kind of sign-in screen. For now though, I’ve entered some example strings to keep things easy. The entire code should look like so: package android.firebaseexample;

import android.support.annotation.NonNull;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import android.widget.Toast;

import com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnCompleteListener;
import com.google.android.gms.tasks.Task;
import com.google.firebase.auth.AuthResult;
import com.google.firebase.auth.FirebaseAuth;
import com.google.firebase.auth.FirebaseUser;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private FirebaseAuth mAuth;
    private FirebaseAuth.AuthStateListener mAuthListener;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        mAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();
        mAuthListener = new FirebaseAuth.AuthStateListener() {
            @Override
            public void onAuthStateChanged(@NonNull FirebaseAuth firebaseAuth) {
                FirebaseUser user = firebaseAuth.getCurrentUser();
                if (user != null) {
                    Log.d("Main Activity", "onAuthStateChanged:signed_in:" + user.getUid());
                } else {
                    Log.d("Main Activity", "onAuthStateChanged:signed_out");
                }
                // ...
            }
        };
        createAccount();
        signInAccount();
    }

    private void createAccount() {
        mAuth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword("example@email.com", "password")
        .addOnCompleteListener(this, new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
                Log.d("Main Activity", "createUserWithEmail:onComplete:" + task.isSuccessful());
    
                if (!task.isSuccessful()) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Authentication failed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            }
        });
    }

    private void signInAccount() {
        mAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword("example@email.com", "password")
        .addOnCompleteListener(this, new OnCompleteListener<AuthResult>() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<AuthResult> task) {
                Log.d("Main Activity", "signInWithEmail:onComplete:" + task.isSuccessful());
                if (!task.isSuccessful()) {
                    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Authentication failed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                }
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        mAuth.addAuthStateListener(mAuthListener);
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop () {
        super.onStop();
        if (mAuthListener != null) {
            mAuth.removeAuthStateListener(mAuthListener);
        }
    }
} Before you test the app, first you need to enable email authentication through your profile. Visit the project in the Firebase console and choose ‘Authentication’ from the menu down the left. You’ll see a list of ‘Sign-In providers’, which includes Email/Password. You want to change the toggle here to ‘Enable’. Now click the tab that says ‘Users’, which should be empty. Keep it open when you run the APK you created though and you should find a new user appears with our ‘example@email.com’ address. Job done! Retrieving data and more functions Using these simple steps, you can now add user-profiles to your apps to improve privacy and customization. If we want to get the user’s email at any point once they’ve signed in, then this is just a matter of using: FirebaseUser user = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser();
String email = user.getEmail(); Of course, you need to check that a user is indeed logged in before doing this. At the bottom of the Assistant window, you’ll be prompted to try setting up authentication using Google or Facebook. Or you can click back and look at storing and retrieving data using the Firebase Realtime Database or setting up analytics.

USA TODAY Rob Pegoraro 3 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Will & Kate open up about life behind palace doors Corbyn hits back at Blair after former PM's call to put party allegiances aside © Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney If you've lost your Gmail password, here's what to do. Q. I forgot to the password to my Gmail account and also no longer have the “recovery email” account I specified when I created the account. How can I get back into my Gmail? A. Everybody forgets passwords, but Gmail’s can be easier to misplace mentally because the site doesn’t nag you for your password every day—if Google sees you connecting from the same computer and location as before, it will assume it’s still you. The usual password-reset method has Google sending a message to the backup email address you designated when you set up your account. But what if that second “recovery” mail account no longer exists? Freelance journalist Jesse Emspak had to deal with that issue recently. He forgot the password he’d just changed on his Gmail, then realized his recovery address was a Verizon account he’d closed at least four years ago. In that case, you’re not out of luck. But you’d better have a good memory of your history with Gmail. Google’s troubleshooter will ask you to fill out an account-recovery form that features questions about how you’ve used Gmail. Emspak said one was when he’d created his account and another was one of the security questions he’d created when opening the account. Three business days later, Google restored his access, allowing him to reset the password and provide a new recovery e-mail address. This issue is likely to affect many more users as Verizon continues its campaign to get its Internet subscribers to move their Verizon email accounts to the mail system of its subsidiary AOL (which will preserve the original @verizon.net addresses) or see those accounts deleted. To make sure your Gmail account isn’t relying on a dead or dying email address, visit https://myaccount.google.com/security and scroll down to “Account recovery options.” While you’re on that page, now would be an excellent time to enable two security options you may have neglected before. Adding your mobile phone number will provide another way to recover your account if you forget the password. No, Google won’t spam you: I don’t think I’ve received a single text message from the company since enabling that option years ago. And setting up two-step verification will stop the theft of your password from resulting in the loss of your account. Anytime Google sees an unusual login, it will ask you to confirm that with a code texted to your phone or generated (even if your phone has no signal) by its free Authenticator app. You can make one other important security upgrade by using a password manager like Dashlane or LastPass (both free) to save your passwords. These services store your passwords in tightly-encrypted form, and their browser extensions will fill them in for you--and unlike people, they can’t be spoofed by phishing sites that look like the real thing but exist at a different address. If you really don’t want to hand over your Gmail password to a third party, you should still write it down somewhere so you don’t get stuck later on. But keep that piece of paper in your wallet or in your home, both of which you already know to keep safe--not on a Post-It note stuck to your computer at work.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

[Rumor] Google May Be Launching Google Drive As Soon As Tuesday, Offering Up To 100GB For A Price Eric Ravenscraft Follow View All Posts 2012/04/23 10:53pm PDTApr 23, 2012 94 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Rumors Hope you're not tired of hearing about the Google Drive! As the rumors about Google's Totally Not Dropbox service leak out in ever-increasing droves, it gets safer and safer to assume the launch is imminent. According to Reuters, Google may be launching the service as soon as Tuesday. Or, as they're calling it across the pond, "today." Reuters also reports that Google will be offering paid storage options going all the way up to 100GB for a price. No word on what that price is, yet. If Reuters is right, though, we won't be waiting long to find out. In any case, Reuters corroborates that 5GB will be the basic free package. Finally, Reuters also reports that the Google Drive will incorporate "sophisticated image search technology" to let users search through a variety of document types. We're not quite sure how exactly this system that will allegedly let users "sift through...photographs" works, but if Google can offer some kind of special search tools, it may give the Drive an edge over competitors like Dropbox. And if any company can improve search on a product, it's Google. Then again, we're still waiting on Google to fix search on the Play Store, but that's another story.

Youre My Boy Bloo No, just Windows and Linux. It is better to leave the morons in the Lion cage alone. Diarrhea Splatters MPAA will rat hump this some how. Taedirk If the MAFIAA had found a way, they would've done it to Amazon already for sending music straight to their cloud or to Google Music for uploading to theirs. cabbieBot excellent username, would read again Taedirk I'm expecting another product with great potential across the board that gets abandoned within a week because nobody thought to listen to consumer feedback.  I could rattle off half a dozen different ways that would be damned impressive for cloud storage to integrate into the services Google offers but I don't expect to see happen.   Calling it now: this is just another knee-jerk "Me too!" Google product like selling media or social networking Roboguy12 Ugh I know, that bothers me to no end. That and the fact that Google comes up with amazing things (Google Music, instant photo backup, contacts backup, etc.) way before anyone else and doesn't brag about it, but when Apple *ahem* "borrows" the idea, everyone goes crazy for it. Google creates amazing products and services, but fails to advertise for them and adapt the products to the users. Ian It didn't happen! Just saw this comment and had to reply. Taedirk I'm still kinda surprised, too. tBs_Battousai I think Google should buy out livedrive as i get unlimited (currently at 2.5TB) for £10 a month, if Google want to play with the big boys that's the kind of thing they need to be offering... Sqube Google doesn't need to do that, though. That's like saying if you're going to sell a car, you should only sell exotic supercars to prove that you're serious. Google is in the business of serving up ads and learning about you so that they can serve up better ads. It makes more sense to get in on the ground floor, rather than jump straight to the penthouse and mock the peons. While there are folks who would certainly jump at the opportunity, they're in the minority. surethom Lets hope it has desktop Sync to sync my Files & music. Amadeus Bonzai Use Google Music to sync your music.  surethom Im in the UK & it is not officially released in the UK, Google is SO slow releasing outside of America.  GigiAUT I'm just wondering, what happens with those of us that bought storage from Google already? I bought 20GB for $5 a year in August last year. Curious how much they'll start charging now and if I can still use all my space I already have. Definitely looking forward to that multiple-platform integration though. Youre My Boy Bloo You PAID for a Google service? Why you did that? GigiAUT Back then my DropBox only had 2,5GB or something, and I didn't want to sign up on any new sites. Google was the easiest to share my photos and videos on (with family scattered around the world, mostly stuff from our reunion last year) and the 20GB for 5 bucks a year was obviously a better deal than anywhere else.  Youre My Boy Bloo If I don't get it today I might kill myself.

Monday, April 24, 2017 Latest: In Europe, The Shifting Sands Of 2017 – Analysis Obama And Clinton Brought Slavery To Libya – OpEd Massacre In Afghanistan By Taliban: Lessons For Pakistan – OpEd South Africa: Hindus To Perform Ancient Fire Ritual For Peace Christians Most Widely Targeted Religious Group In World Eurasia Review A Journal of Analysis and News News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology About Editorial Staff Authors and Partners Contact Submit an Article Buzz Future Privacy Policy And Terms Of Use Islamic State and Internet 1 Analysis Technology  How Islamic State Disseminates Propaganda Over The Internet – Analysis April 24, 2017 Modern Diplomacy 0 Comment Internet, Islamic State, Security, Social Media, Terrorism By Modern Diplomacy By Lorand Bodo, M.A. and Anne Speckhard, Ph.D.* As ISIS is rapidly losing its territory in Syria and Iraq they continue to win on the digital battlefield, maintaining a strong recruiting presence in the digital space[1]. As ISIS cadres inspire and even direct terrorist attacks on different continents, the West must realize that it is long past due to mount a strong and resolute digital battle against ISIS—to stop them radicalizing and guiding the world’s terror plots from afar[2]. To fight terrorist propaganda on the Internet, social media companies, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have all instituted take down policies[3] and teamed up with Microsoft to create a database of unique ‘fingerprints’ to automatically detect terrorist propaganda in the form of images and videos[4]. Additionally, Facebook has recently announced that it would develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to review content on their social network[5]. Likewise, Jigsaw—Google’s technology incubator and think tank—came up with a clever approach by utilizing the so-called ‘Redirect Method’[6]. That is, once certain keywords and phrases are typed into Google’s search box, links appear that redirect the user to content that is deemed as effectively countering ISIS’ propaganda[7]. Despite these efforts, however, ISIS still continues to successfully disseminate its propaganda on the internet. A recent study did find a productivity drop of approximately 36 percent as in contrast to ISIS’ productivity height in the summer of 2015,[8] yet intelligence professionals credit ISIS with five new recruiting videos a week and there was a bump in ISIS propaganda following the London attacks[9]. Likewise, in two recent studies ICSVE research fellows located over the space of only a few hours over 50 English and 70 Albanian speaking ISIS endorsing, spreading and following Facebook accounts.[10] YouTube also continues to host for months at a time numerous ISIS promoting testimonies and videos as documented by a researcher following ISIS propaganda on YouTube.[11] Likewise, as ISIS has found it more difficult to operate in the non-encrypted space they have learned to coax their followers into the encrypted spaces of Telegram, WhatsApp etc. where they are further lead down the terrorist trajectory—encouraged to travel or stay at home to mount terror attacks. It’s imperative to understand ISIS’s current social media and Internet-based dissemination process before we can judge the effectiveness of existing counter measures. To do so, we conducted a small study on the dissemination of ISIS propaganda on the Surface Web – that is the proportion of the World Wide Web, which is indexed and thus searchable with standard search engines such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo etc.[12] Based on our previous Facebook research, we used hashtags, keywords and phrases in English and Arabic known to identify ISIS followers, endorsers and distributers on social media. Once again we quickly identified several social media accounts, websites and forums hosting ISIS propaganda. Most interestingly, however, we found that all these sources link back to a single source—what we call the ’Daily Harvester’. The ‘Daily Harvester’ is a person or group of people that collects official ISIS propaganda, creates and shares a 40 to 80 page ‘daily briefing’ containing everything from pictures to videos to news bulletins. These summaries intend to ‘inform’ ISIS supporters on a daily basis by providing a summary of yesterday’s events, news and media releases. However, these daily briefings have also the potential to radicalize others as well as foster the existing belief system of already radicalized individuals. Figure 1 In this case, the Daily Harvester is called Abu Abdellah Al-Ifriqi [أبو عبد الله الإفريقي][13] and even has created his own logo (see Figure 1). We assume that Abu Abddellah is an official ISIS representative. We monitored Abu Abdellah for approximately one month (March 16 to April 16, 2017) to identify the key phases and tools he uses in the dissemination process (Figure 2). Four distinct and consecutive phases emerged in observing his activities. First, the Daily Harvester monitors official ISIS media outlets, such as Amaq News Agency or Al-Hayat Media, for example. Second, he then collects published audios, documents, news, photos and videos and puts everything together into a single document. Third, he uploads the briefing onto only two websites – justpaste.it and addpost.it. These ‘paste-websites’ allow anyone to simply paste and publish content on the Surface Web by providing a unique link that can be shared. Finally, the harvester uses the generated link and shares it via social media platforms, forums and other websites to reach out to as many people as possible with a vast compendium of current ISIS propaganda. Figure 2 (Created in Lucidchart) Abu Abdellah is not the only Daily Harvester. Daily Harvesters are incredibly dangerous because they spread a huge quantity of ISIS propaganda at the click of a link, making it accessible to anyone. Put differently, anyone who knows how to use Google will be able to find these briefings and it’s a simple matter using Google Translator to read and view them in ones own language. For this reason, we need to take action against these simultaneous compilers and distributors of ISIS materials. If we don’t do that we will see repeats of what happened in London, Stockholm, Nice and Toronto, to name but just a few—as these attacks occurred as a result of Internet enticement into ISIS ranks and thinking. There is no doubt that this will be an incredibly difficult task, however, based on our analysis, we recommend two strategies for the digital battlefield: First, we need to disrupt the dissemination process and second we need to counter their propaganda by pushing counter-narrative materials that will appeal to ISIS followers and endorsers into the digital spaces where they lurk and currently imbibe of ISIS poison. Counter-narratives: Using emotionally evocative and strong counter-narrative materials, preferably that rely on ISIS insiders denouncing the group as ICSVE is producing in multiple languages—because we know that ISIS followers narrow their attention to listening only to ISIS insiders[14], we recommend using the same hashtags as used by the ‘Harvester’ to reach out to those who are looking for the daily briefings. Likewise, we recommend using justpaste.it and addpost.it to upload and publish counter-narratives as this would be appealing to those who regularly visit these websites to access the Harvester’s briefings. Disruptive measures: We recommend the development and use of an automated and artificial intelligence based detection software for social media platforms, in particular Twitter and Facebook. This searches, amongst others, for three things: First, hashtags used by the Daily Harvester and secondly, links provided, such as justpaste.it and addpost.it. Abu Abdullah, the Daily Harvester we studied for example, uses only these two websites. Lastly, we discovered social media that accounts on Twitter and Facebook that disseminated the link, were not permanent and in fact, changed on a daily basis. Therefore, as a final point, we recommend integrating the age of an account as an important indicator for potentially being a disseminator. Disrupting the link between the website that hosts the content and potential ‘customers’ is more effective than trying to directly take down the Harvesters themselves or the hosting websites. That is due to several reasons: first, Daily Harvesters can be easily replaced. Second, daily briefings can be published on millions of other websites; hence, tackling websites would result in a cat and mouse game. Third, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. are popular social media platforms and there are little to no alternatives in terms of reaching out to millions of people, which also implies that ISIS will continue to covertly and cleverly attempt to exploit these platforms. Additionally, fake ‘daily briefings’ could also be uploaded to these sites following the Daily Harvester’s protocols with malware to enable law and intelligence forces to gather sensitive information on those who download the briefings. ISIS is losing on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, but is winning in the digital space – we need to adapt and fight back.

The doodle sees a larger-than-life Rajkumar on the silver screen while the audience sitting in a theatre cheers for him. According to Google doodle team's post on their blog, "Early drafts of today's Doodle featured different interpretations of the beloved star's work. The first illustrates Rajkumar singing and holding the white bird from Kasturi Nivasa, a quintessential Kannada drama and a cornerstone of Rajkumar's cinematic legacy. Another Doodle draft showcases an array of iconic characters Rajkumar played over a half century of acting. Ultimately, the Doodle team decided to feature Rajkumar's larger-than-life personality beaming at a crowd of moviegoers from the silver screen where his legacy lives on for generations of Indian audiences." The doodle will be seen for the entire day today. Born on April 4, 1929, as Singanalluru Puttaswamayya Muthuraju, the legendary actor is a four-time National award winner, a recipient of the Padma Bhushan (in 1983) and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award (in 1995) for the lifetime contribution to Indian Cinema. He started his film career in 1954 in the film 'Bedara Kannapa' and went on to star in over 220 movies, his last being 'Shabdavedhi' in 2000. In 2000, the Kannada icon had to face a bad phase, when he was kidnapped by sandalwood smuggler Veerappan and was held captive for 108 days. The actor died of cardiac arrest at his residence in Bangalore on April 12, 2006, at the age of 77.

These days it can feel like there are too many great smartphones on the market: the iPhone 7, LG G6, Google Pixel and so on. British consumers have ample choice, and with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S8, your options have widened even further. To figure out exactly what smartphone is right for you, we wanted to look at how the new Galaxy S8 stacks up against the competition. This time, it's Samsung versus the Google Pixel. Let's look at the facts and break down their specs, price and design in detail. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: Design Samsung has been chasing Apple's crown in the design game for a while, and with the Galaxy S8, we think it has overhauled Apple. Samsung has gone for an edge-to-edge design, with an unusual 18:9 aspect ratio. By removing the border around the phone and ditching the home button, Samsung has created what is certainly one of the most striking designs currently on the market. It makes the S8 ideal for scrolling the web, and the product feels right in a user's hand. The Google Pixel is by no means an unattractive device. In fact, if you weren't paying attention, you might be fooled into thinking your eyes were looking at an iPhone. The Pixel is made with a solid aluminium unibody design, also great to hold. However, the Pixel XL feels a little more awkward in hand than the new Samsung Galaxy S8, despite the S8/S8 Plus being bigger. The Pixel is part glass, part metal, with a glass panel situated at the top of the screen. An odd design choice, you might think. But primarily Google made this decision because it wanted its services to be at the forefront of the Pixel phone. Android Pay can't work efficiently through metal, and thus the glass panel was born. So who's the winner? The edge goes to Samsung for the Galaxy S8's 'infinity' edge-to-edge display. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: Camera On its release, Google highlighted benchmarks from DxOMark, who put it ahead of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7's optics. But is that still true now the Galaxy S8 is around? The Samsung Galaxy S8 offers a 12mp camera, which on paper is the same as the S7, but in our tests actually produced marginally better images in low light thanks to an improved DSP and better software. Does it beat the Pixel? Not quite: we found that the Pixel still has a slight edge. Colours are a little better, you get a little more detail, and low-light performance is improved. But – and this is an important point – both phones have excellent cameras. You're very unlikely to be disappointed no matter which you go for. So this round goes to the Pixel – just. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: Price We thought the Google Pixel was pricey when it was unveiled at £599, but the Galaxy S8 starts at a whopping £689, going up to £779 if you opt for the Plus model. Without a doubt, Google offers better value for money with the Pixel, but buyers will have to determine whether the lower price is worth sacrificing what makes the Samsung Galaxy S8 great. Do you go for a bolder design or a safer bet? We wouldn't blame you for going with the Pixel, though many smartphone enthusiasts won't be able to resist the modern design of the S8. This time, it's definitely a point to the Pixel. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: Operating System Both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel run on Android 7 Nougat. Samsung's device, though, comes with its standard selection of first-party software. Some might see this as clutter; others may welcome it. The new Bixby AI even has a dedicated button, a big deal considering the Samsung's S8's minimal design. This might seem a little like overkill considering the device still offers the standard "OK Google", but Samsung does like to push its software. With the Pixel, Nougat comes slightly reskinned, prioritising some of the more intelligent apps such as Google Duo, Allo, Photos, Drive and Assistant, all of which come pre-installed. If you don't like clutter, the Pixel offers simplicity while also providing everything you need from the get-go. And of course there's the issue of updates. Because the Pixel comes from Google, you're almost certain to get new versions of Android faster, often on the day of release. Samsung isn't the slowest Android vendor, but it's still slower at getting new versions of the operating system out than Google is. As both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel run on mostly the same software, there's not that much in it, but to our mind the look and feel of vanilla Android will always win out over TouchWiz, so it's a point to the Pixel. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: The key specs It often comes down to the nitty-gritty of a device's specs when making a decision on a smartphone. The Google Pixel is powered by a 2.15GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, built upon 4GB of system RAM and utilising either 32GB or 128GB of storage. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S8 boasts an Exynos 8895 10nm octa-core , 64-bit.    The Google Pixel runs very well, though the smaller manufacturing process of the Galaxy S8 should mean better performance. We've yet to put these devices head-to-head in this respect but have high hopes for the 10nm chip. At 5 inches, the Google Pixel's screen is a little smaller than the Samsung Galaxy S8's 5.8in display, while the Pixel XL packs just a 5.5in display. Nevertheless, the S8 doesn't feel overwhelmingly big, thanks in part to Samsung's slick design. The Pixel's screen resolution is 1,080 x 1,920, significantly lower than Samsung's brilliant 2,960 x 1,440. Samsung is known for its great screens, and the Galaxy S8 is no exception – it shines here. However, Google Pixel's AMOLED screen shouldn't be overlooked. It's capable of displaying 441 pixels per inch (PPI) and falls pretty much in line with the iPhone 7, another accomplished device. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: Fingerprint sensor Samsung's new design with the S8 has seen the fingerprint sensor shifted to the rear of the device, and it's safe to say views are mixed on this at the moment. The main issue is how easy it is to smudge the camera lens at the same time, by missing the fingerprint sensor and hitting the lens instead. However, the Google Pixel also has a rear fingerprint sensor in the top third panel on its back, putting the two on a pretty level playing field here. It's not a huge deal, especially if you choose to use Samsung's facial recognition software, but it's something to note about both phones. Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S8: The verdict The Galaxy S8 has a very bold design, and in some areas – screen, overall performance and design – it beats the Pixel. In contrast, the Pixel has the better the camera, a marginally more attractive version of Android, and that all-important lower price tag. We think the crucial factor is going to be the price. The Google device is alarmingly cheaper than Samsung's. On the other hand, if you're buying on contract and thus spreading the cost out over two years, the difference in monthly payments is going to be tiny, which makes the Galaxy S8 a better choice.

It may not be as “noisy” as Spotify, but it does get the job done. Samsung has announced that starting with their new flagships, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, Google Play Music will be the default music player and music service. This will also happen to all their smartphones and tablets that will be launched in 2017. What new Samsung device users will be able to enjoy from Google Play Music is free curated radio and smart music recommendations based on what you usually listen to. They will also be able to listen to and discover new podcasts since it also serves as a podcast streaming service. And since it is a music player as well, all the locally stored mp3s or any music you saved on the device can be streamed using the service. Samsung and Google collaborated on exclusive features as well. Users will be able to upload and stream up to 100,000 songs from their own music collection, which is actually double the allocation from the regular Google Play Music users. And with your purchase of a new Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, or Galaxy Tab 3, you get a free 3-month subscription to their on-demand streaming service and ad-free access to the more than 40 million songs in their library. Users will also be able to have access to YouTube Red so they can stream ad-free videos while still on the trial period. Of course the availability of Google Play Music and YouTube Red varies, so this special treat will only be applicable where they are. Device support for older Samsung phones and tablets may be expanded in the future.

Las Vegas – Adoption of virtual reality and mixed reality platforms is at its nascent stages, but broadcasters should start to experiment and learn about them now, execs in the sector said here Sunday during a panel dedicated to the topic. Google, the company behind Cardboard and new mobile VR platforms such as Daydream, is encouraging a “sense of experimentation” by collaborating with newsrooms, Nicholas Whitaker, training and development manager at the Google News Lab said during a panel titled, The Outlook for 360 / VR / AR in Local Markets. The message to them, he said, is “to start experimenting now” despite some of the questions that are swirling around emerging VR platforms, including the underlying business models. But a key challenge is to ensure that VR content is made for the medium, and not merely something that has simply been optimized for the platform, noted Ryan Pulliam, chief marketing office and co-founder of Specular Theory, a company that works with partners to create multiple forms of VR content and experiences, including cinematic fare and games. VR content, she said, “really needs to be its own story” and requires “a new type of creative,” but likewise stressed that it can also serve as an ancillary or companion piece to another piece of content. Whitaker agreed that VR requires a different approach to storytelling, as it provides an immersive platform in which one must “put the viewer first.” “This is really an evolution into experiences,” said Caitlin Burns, CEO of Caitlin Burns & Associates, a consultant for media customers that’s been focused on Web VR formats. “It’s a new challenge that brings people together from all different fields.” Those who enter the VR fold today, Burns added later, will have an opportunity to be at the forefront, create the “foundation” for the medium, and obtain valuable data that can be applied as the sector grows and expands. Amy Shafqat, neuroscientist at Experius VR, said it’s also important to decide on the kind of outcome broadcasters want to achieve for the group being targeted and to make a decision on how much “control” they are willing to give to the viewer. A big question for anyone in the VR game is how to make money on that content. Those models are still percolating. “We’re certainly setting ourselves up to monetize,” Pulliam said, noting that’s she’s bullish on the market, and that the current focus is on capturing the audience.

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A Google spokeswoman said the company’s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results. Photo: NYT How times change. Two decades later, it’s not unusual for a smartphone user to see only ads on a Google search page before scrolling down to the regular results.When Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings this week, the internet giant’s big profits are expected to demonstrate yet again that the billboard space accompanying Google queries is the web’s most valuable real estate for advertisements. Related Content Google ad crisis spreads as biggest marketers pull spending Google ads boycott unlikely in Australia In the 17 years since Google introduced text-based advertising above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them. The ad creep on Google has pushed “organic” search results farther down the screen, an effect even more pronounced on the smaller displays of smartphones.The changes are profound for retailers and brands that rely on leads from Google searches to drive online sales. With limited space available near the top of search results, not advertising on search terms associated with your brand or displaying images of your products is tantamount to telling potential customers to spend their money elsewhere. Advertisement The biggest development with search ads is the proliferation of product listing ads, or PLAs. In a departure from its text-based ads, Google started allowing retailers to post pictures, descriptions and prices of products at the top of search results in 2009.In recent years, Google has served more product ads and expanded their availability to more general search terms – for example, showing photo ads on a search for “running shoes,” not just “Nike Air Max”. It has also tinkered with the size, location and number of ads on results pages for both computers and smartphones.Retailers are snapping up product ads. They accounted for 52 per cent of all Google search ad spending by retailers in the first quarter of 2017, versus 8 percent in 2011, according to the digital marketing agency Merkle.”PLAs takes the search engine results page to a different level,” said Andy Taylor, Merkle’s associate director of research.A Google spokeswoman said the company’s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results.”Our goal has always been to deliver results that people find immediately useful, which is even more important on mobile devices with smaller screens,” said the spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho. “For most queries, we show no ads, and we recently removed right-hand text ads for all queries. For highly commercial queries, our extensive testing shows that people find relevant ads and offers extremely useful.”The importance of being at the top of search results is fuelling fierce competition for ads.

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) Comparing Five iOS Travel Management Apps by Mike Matthews Well over 30 years ago, I had just started a new job when the boss strolled by — and out of the clear, blue, friendly skies asked me to make an airline reservation for him. I had little to go on, just the destination airport, travel days, and some rough travel times. I had no idea about his airline preferences, much less whether he preferred window or aisle seating. Back in those days, you called a travel agent and stepped through the process of getting a ticket delivered to your door. Or, if you wanted to make sure the travel agent was on target, you could do a little of the legwork yourself first by looking up flights in the Official Airline Guide, a thick book with tiny phonebook type. I eventually located a suitable set of flights and passed the info on to his assistant, who dutifully typed the itinerary on an index card for him to carry in his pocket. How times have changed! Airlines now offer booking Web sites, their own apps, and mobile boarding passes. Plus, you can quickly and easily research flights, hotels, rental cars, and more with apps that are dedicated to that purpose. But two things haven’t changed: travel is still a very personal thing, and I’m still looking for the best way to keep all my travel info in one place. The index card approach just doesn’t cut it today. Over the years, I’ve done a fair bit of traveling, both business and personal, and here’s what I’m looking for in a travel management app: Easy and largely automatic itinerary creation The capability to share an itinerary with others Automatic updates for flight changes Syncing of data across multiple devices Notifications in as many ways as possible Thoroughness, with all the bases covered A streamlined interface, ideally allowing one-handed use while on the move through an airport There are a number of candidates in the App Store, but these five stood out: Google Trips, App in the Air, Kayak, TripCase, and TripIt. All the apps have most of the same basic features. After you set up an account with their service, they scan your email inbox for details about a trip (flight times, hotel bookings, etc.) and build an itinerary for you. With most of the apps, you can also either forward booking emails you’ve received to a standard address to create the itinerary or enter the details manually. Once the trip is in place, the app generates additional information such as airport info and local weather, and adds it to your itinerary. You can share the trip with others, add the details to your calendar, and receive trip-related notifications such as check-in times and flight delays. If you’re on the move, your travel plans should move with you in the most convenient way possible. So all these apps make their data accessible on different devices, and most of them extend a subset of their features to the Apple Watch. Only Google Trips lacks an Apple Watch app, and of the other four, only TripIt doesn’t include a complication that can show at-a-glance flight details such as gate information, time to check-in, and baggage claim carousels. Also, all but Google Trips include a Messages app, which can be helpful if you regularly need to share trip details in conversations. Beyond these basics, there’s plenty of room for each app to differentiate itself, be it through the use of crowdsourcing, packing lists, flight trackers, or the ability to book travel from within the app. In short, there’s probably an app in this group with features that will best fit your needs. We can’t cover every nuance in this article, but let’s take a look at some of the more interesting features. Google Trips -- Google is nearly ubiquitous and its services are generally regarded as being top tier. Plenty of people rely on Google while planning and booking travel plans, so organizing travel information with the free Google Trips app seems like a reasonable extension of its services. Setup is simple. You allow the app to access your location while using it, allow notifications about your trip to be sent to you, and sign in with your Google account, giving the app permission to detect past and future trips from information it can find in your Gmail account. From there, the app’s real strength appears, as it suggests things to do, creates customizable daily itineraries of places to go, provides food and drink recommendations, covers how to get around in the local area, and offers “need to know” facts such as emergency numbers, shopping, and tipping info. Plus, it lets you download all this information from Google for offline viewing. Making use of Google’s vast collection of the world’s knowledge is easily the strongest part of the app. However, Google Trips is the newest of the five apps in the group and lacks many features that the others have. If you don’t use Gmail as your primary email provider, Google Trips won’t be nearly as useful. You can add a trip manually, but unlike the other services, Google doesn’t offer a standard email address to which your booking emails can be forwarded to create an itinerary. Many of the other four apps offer at least some notification options. Google Trips itself contains no notification settings within the app, just the opportunity during setup to enable them — but offers no specifics as to what the notifications are. Also, in the current version of the app, you can’t share itineraries, which may be a deal-breaker for many people. There’s also just an iPhone app; no iPad, Apple Watch, or Messages app. And now a confession: I don’t use Google’s services much. As such, Google Trips has limited value for me because it relies heavily on harvesting flight data from a Google account. As the new app on the block, it’s also missing basic features that the other more mature apps have. But if you’re waist-deep in the Google ecosystem, the way the app makes it easy to explore your destination might make it the ideal solution for you or as a companion to one of the other apps. App in the Air -- Not surprisingly, given its name, the free App in the Air focuses on managing air travel but has recently begun to branch out by allowing you to include hotel and car rental details in your itinerary. Flights are organized into cards. Tapping a card reveals all the details from a generous selection of up to 16 customizable widgets, including a timeline, airport and airline info, an online check-in form, maps, wait times, hotel and car rental details, and more. Unique among the five apps, App in the Air presents flight information in a timeline of four segments: Check-in, Boarding, Take-off, and Landing. Knowing these four items in a flight’s timeline can help you prepare for your flight and keep family and business associates in the loop as to your schedule. You can also allow App in the Air to access your calendar to import existing flights and access your contacts for itinerary notifications. App in the Air offers plenty of push and text alerts that you can activate individually (including one for in-flight exercises), but you’ll need a subscription to make them work. Other premium features ($29.99 per year with a free 14-day trial or $49.99 for lifetime access) include a family subscription and unlimited auto check-in. As with many freemium apps, it sports a long list of in-app purchases that range from disabling ads for $0.99 to a lifetime subscription for flight alerts for $49.99. Other notable features include: You can subscribe family and friends to flight alerts too, keeping them in the loop should your itinerary change. Some of the widgets are innovative. One allows you to track your luggage on American Airlines flights. The TSA Rules widget lets you enter an item and responds with rules about whether the item may be carried on board or must be stowed in checked bags. And sometimes widgets appear only if they are relevant; for example, the Uber widget shows up only if there’s service where you are. If you enter your passport information, App in the Air can theoretically check you in for flights automatically. I couldn’t get this feature to work, perhaps because I didn’t have an active subscription, but it would come in handy for airlines like Southwest that don’t assign seats in advance. You can export trips to any of your calendars, which can save you the extra step of downloading flight itineraries from an airline’s Web site and adding them to your calendar. You can import itineraries from TripIt. So if, for example, you want to switch from using TripIt or your company has standardized on TripIt, but you prefer the App in the Air interface or features, it’s easy to do so. You can also import flight plans by scanning your boarding pass or from the boarding pass stored in Apple’s Wallet app; on the back of the pass, just tap Share Pass, then tap App in the Air. If you’re into tracking your travel, let App in the Air do the heavy lifting. It can log miles, hours, airports, and more. You can also earn badges for your achievements. There’s even a whimsical award for Time Travel, but you’ll need to supply your own flux capacitor. To help you get through airports more efficiently, App in the Air includes maps and crowdsourced wait times for check-in, passport processing, and security. If you’re still using scraps of paper to track what to pack, you might like App in the Air’s editable packing list. App in the Air can help you track loyalty points for airlines, hotels, rental cars, and other entities, but the feature is relatively limited, particularly for U.S. airlines. It also requires creating yet another account, with Points Loyalty Wallet. There’s a lot to like in App in the Air and there’s likely more to come. The cost to enable the additional features provided by the subscription isn’t cheap. But if you fly regularly, the lifetime subscription is probably a worthwhile bet to place, since the app receives regular feature updates. I highly recommend App in the Air. Kayak -- Now owned by Priceline, the free Kayak app boasts a long list of travel-related features. Most notably it helps you find and book flights, hotel rooms, and rental cars; and provides a top-notch interface. You can filter your searches by a multitude of categories, including price, non-stop flights, car type, hotel brands, amenities, and much more. When the search results are presented you can book them, or in the case of flights and hotel rooms, set up a price alert. Kayak does a nice job suggesting whether it makes sense to buy an airline ticket immediately, or to wait a while and see if prices come down. Kayak takes travel planning a step further with its Explore feature. You set parameters for your trip, such as a budget, time of year, location, and activities, and Kayak responds with suggestions. Along with all the basics, once a trip is created, you can also add related events and details such as meetings, dinners, and local transportation, a plus for business travelers. One-upping App in the Air, Kayak automatically creates a calendar feed with all your itineraries, so if information about the trip changes, it’s automatically updated in your calendar. To get the URL for the calendar feed, you’ll need to log in to Kayak on the Web and look in Trips Settings. Kayak recently added the capability to import booking confirmations automatically from Gmail accounts. That’s a nice improvement, but like Google Trips, it works only with Gmail while App in the Air and TripIt can sift through the inboxes of many more email services. Kayak provides a number of other niceties: Kayak’s flight tracker isn’t limited to just the flights you travel on. You can track any flight you want; that’s helpful if you’re the one making the airport run to pick up Grandma. It can automatically share all new trips with others via email. Kayak even provides the option of letting others edit the trip, which would be useful for an administrative aide to add a meeting for a traveling boss. When you add a hotel manually to an itinerary, Kayak automatically fills in the address, phone number, and URL for the property. Hotel details include a section on nearby restaurants (courtesy of OpenTable, another Priceline company) and a Show Driver button that displays the hotel address to show a driver if there’s a language barrier. In addition to email, SMS, and notifications, Kayak can also send flight status alerts via Facebook Messenger. You can use autofill for your contact info, pulling your data out of your Contacts app with a couple of taps. These autofill settings can be kept in sync through iCloud. So if you change any of your contact info — say, your home address — you can change it on one device and let iCloud handle the syncing with the rest of your devices. Kayak is the only app of the bunch that has an Apple TV app. That makes it easier for people to do travel planning together… and I’ll bet those shots of the French Riviera on a 60-inch TV screen are enticing. While it’s a good fit for personal travel, Kayak also works well for business travelers, who can use the app to include meetings and other events in their itineraries, follow flight plans of co-workers, and allow others to edit their trips. If you’re looking for a single app to plan, book, and manage travel, you can’t go wrong with Kayak, especially given that it’s entirely free. TripCase -- Our next entry is TripCase, which is owned by Sabre — perhaps the first company to get into the real-time, computer-based air travel booking business. TripCase provides a full array of travel management tools, including several that target business travelers. Unlike the other apps, after you set up an account and complete your profile (which you must do to use TripCase), TripCase doesn’t search through your email for travel info and automatically build itineraries. Instead, you either: Forward email confirmation messages with travel info to trips@tripcase.com or enter the details manually. Use a TripCase affiliate to do bookings, in which case, the details will automatically be added to your account. An affiliate is any airline, travel agency, company travel department, or supplier that uses TripCase’s technology to automatically import reservations into a traveler’s TripCase account. Unfortunately, there’s no list of affiliates to be found online or in the app, so your results may be hit-and-miss. Neither of these is as friction-free as having the app look through your inbox. And the mystery surrounding the affiliates isn’t good, either — two demerits. Once you have a trip built, you can add activities such as meetings, restaurants, and attractions, and the app provides access to Uber, airport maps, weather, and other information right within the trip. Separate screens provide links to restaurants and things to see and do at your destination. TripCase offers the usual trappings, such as push/email alerts and the capability to share trips with others, although updates other than flight changes are not sent automatically to people you designate. However, if those people sign up for TripCase, your trip appears in a convenient Following list, with full updates — a handy feature for business travelers. On the calendar side, TripCase lets you do a one-time import of your trips, or it can create a calendar feed that will update itself. Of course, there’s more: TripCase shows a Tripfeed in its details screen that may include helpful information such as a link to an airport map or ads that suggest you buy various trip-related items such as travel insurance, an audiobook for the flight, and an airport lounge ticket. Unfortunately, there’s no way to turn off the ads with an in-app purchase. TripCase offers (for a $5.99 in-app purchase good for a year after a 1-month trial period) the option of storing images of your receipts as PDF files to save time when filling out expense reports, a welcome feature for business travelers. You can use TripCase to search for alternate flights for future trips you have planned. An Apple Watch app displays an itinerary as well as nearby locations. But while the complication appears in the list contained in the Watch app, it would not appear as an option under the Faces section of the app. TripCase is clearly built for business travelers. But it feels incredibly dated in terms of look and feel and lacks too many standard features that its counterparts have. Unless your company mandates its use, I recommend looking elsewhere because there are better options. TripIt -- As with a couple of the other apps, TripIt is part of a larger company’s travel portfolio. It’s owned by Concur Technologies, which provides travel and expense management services to businesses. Concur also owns Hipmunk, another app that can book flights and hotels. Combine the two and you have a travel solution aimed squarely at business travelers. TripIt has all the basics covered and, like Kayak and TripCase, you can manually beef up your itineraries with additional travel plans, such as train or ferry trips, and activities like meetings or theater outings. TripIt provides a calendar feed that maintains updated itineraries in your calendar app. You can share trips, which isn’t unusual, but TripIt allows you to share only parts of your itinerary, so you could choose to share flight info but not hotel arrangements, for example. For $49 per year, you can upgrade to TripIt Pro and get flight status alerts by text or email, reward tracking with a number of vendors, check-in reminders, automatic trip sharing, flight refund monitoring, and more. That cost is higher than what other apps charge, but you can try TripIt Pro for 30 days for free. TripIt is big on social via its Network feature, offering a dizzying array of options, including: You can post travel plans to LinkedIn, Facebook, Yammer, and Salesforce Chatter. You can add connections to other people either manually or through your Google or Yahoo email accounts. Once connections are made, you and your connection can each see summaries of each other’s trips. In addition, TripIt can spot when connections are near each other when travel plans overlap. TripIt Pro users can create an “inner circle,” members of which see your detailed itineraries and get automatic notifications when you create new trips. People in your inner circle do not have to be TripIt Pro users and trip information is shared only from you to them, not the other way. You can optionally choose to allow an inner circle member to edit your trips, which might be handy if your assistant regularly handles such details anyway. You can designate individual trips as private to avoid sharing trip information, even with your inner circle. And that’s not all: TripIt stores an extended set of profile info, including space for travel documents like your passport, TSA Pre, CLEAR, and driver license. It can also store travel-related contacts such as emergency contacts, house sitters, boarding kennels, and so on. Like App in the Air, TripIt can track basic travel stats. There are no medals for achievements, though. You can create groups for free. People with email addresses with the same domain (think companies) can use a shared calendar to coordinate travel schedules and see other group members’ trips and locations on a map. Trips can also be made private. For $29 per month for up to 10 users (with prices scaling up to $159 per month for 100 users), an organization can subscribe to TripIt for Teams, which offers the group features above along with team-wide spending reports and a travel dashboard that shows all of the team’s travel plans in one place. It’s best suited for an organization that has a department arranging travel for others. TripIt is solid on all fronts and works equally well for both personal and business travel. If you travel a lot, the Pro features are a must-have. Unless you have a big problem with using a separate app to book travel, TripIt has you covered. Book It -- Let’s wrap it up. All five of these apps can work for personal travel, but Kayak, App in the Air, and TripIt are clearly ahead of Google Trips and TripCase thanks to a more complete set of features. Kayak and TripIt are best suited for business travelers given their capability to add other activities to trip itineraries, and the inclusion of TripIt’s $49 Pro package gives it a slight edge over Kayak for business travelers. With its features that appeal to groups and teams, TripIt is the best option for organizations that need to manage complex travel calendars and costs, bolstering its position as the best app for business travelers.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Simon   2017-04-18 19:25 I'm not a big fan of "free" services. I don't like myself or my data being sold off beyond my control. I prefer paying up front for services just as I expect to be paid a salary for my own work. So with that said, no way I'm relying on some google stuff. A couple years ago I bought Flight Update and I have used it a lot since on various iPhones. I saved all my travel itineraries and used it to keep me updated about changes, remind me of layover times, even plot the great circle route for my long haul flights. Everything was just fine until a few months ago when out of thin air the app stopped working. At first I thought it was just some communications issue when it couldn't load details for a flight number. Quickly after that I realized though it was happening to all the flights I entered. So it turns out that the app has ceased to work. Anybody who wants to continue to use it will have to buy the new "Pro" version for $10. And if you want to migrate your data, you have to go through some convoluted process to move it from the previous paid (but no longer supported and working) app to the new more expensive (and supported for nobody knows how long) "pro" app. I really liked the app and I'm sure Flight Update Pro is great too, but there is no way in hell I would ever support a company that pulls these kinds of shenanigans on its paying customers. Shutting off a working app without warning and expecting people to pay for another app just to regain lost functionality they had already paid for and on top of it all not preserving data (w/o extra user effort) cannot go unpunished. So that leads me to my question. What other app can I get to replace this formerly great app? The apps the author proposes seem to focus on automation and sharing. I'm not interested in any of that. I'm fine entering my data by hand, I prefer my privacy. I don't need to share my travel details with anybody and if I do a simple txt email fwd is good enough. I prefer a simple and clean interface with quick and seamless information updates in real time. Especially if I don't have to sell myself out to a company like Google to have this done "for me". Any suggestions?

That's a great review. Unfortunately his app of choice is Flight Update Pro which I will not pay for after the cr*p they recently pulled when they broke their other paid app. His number two seems to be The FlightTracker. It's only $4. I'll probably give that a spin. Reply Mike Matthews   2017-04-19 14:09 I'd give Kayak a look. True, you have to give them your data, but it's been very good (and timely) for me when it comes to traveler, pick-up, and drop-off notifications (flight changes, check-in reminders, baggage claim carousels, etc.) via email or text. See the Trips settings. Reply David Harvey  2017-04-23 19:07 For many years I've used TravelTracker Pro. First used it on my Palm Pilot and it was ported over to IOS. I've tried some of the ones reviewed, but found no reason to switch. Still a great app. I like it very much.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 22 April, 2017 04:25 - - - - print email Comments A Microsoft document detailing the minimum hardware specs for Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud-powered laptops seems to be the best evidence yet that Microsoft plans to launch a Chromebook competitor on May 2. Windows Central obtained a “recommended minimum spec” document, presumably handed out to Microsoft’s partners. The document outlines what Microsoft hopes to achieve with what the document calls an “Edu Cloud device” (and industry watchers have dubbed "Cloudbooks"): all-day battery life, a quick boot and resume cycle, and at least a quad-core Intel Celeron processor powering it all. It’s also titled “Windows 10 Cloud Performance Targets,” confirming the name of the new OS. A Microsoft representative declined to comment. Microsoft’s invitation to an education-focused launch event in New York on May 2 hinted strongly that a Chromebook competitor was in the cards. Though Windows PCs dominate the workplace, Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks have quickly insinuated themselves into American classrooms. Google and its partners have pitched Chromebooks as affordable, simple to use and manage, and rugged enough to survive student use. Windows 10 Cloud appears to be Microsoft's attempt to go back to school. The impact on you: One key advantage of a Chromebook, from Google’s perspective, is that it contributes to a virtuous cycle: Kids use the popular Android tablets and phones at home, then access something similar in the classroom. To help break that chain, Microsoft needs to get kids used to Windows. While this may have little impact on you personally, you might say that this is a fight for the hearts and minds of your children. What Cloudbooks will contain Windows 10 Cloud reportedly will restrict apps to the Windows Store, forbidding the use of non-Store apps like Google Chrome. Microsoft’s document also notes that its performance benchmarks assume the use of Intune device management policies specifically designed for the classroom. The spec document plainly states that Microsoft considers Chromebooks its chief competition. In a comparison of “performance benchmarks,” Microsoft’s target is 10-plus hours of “all day” battery life, with cold-boot times of 20 seconds and resume times of under 2 seconds. The document does not list suggested pricing. Likewise, Microsoft lays out what hardware the new devices should include: a quad-core chip, like a Celeron, or higher; 4GB of RAM, and at least 32GB of eMMC or SSD storage. Interestingly, pen and touchscreen capabilities are listed as “optional,” which would discard one of the chief advantages that a typical Windows PC has over a Chromebook. Who will make these devices remains a mystery at the moment. PC companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo have all already built Chromebooks, meaning they’ll have to choose between platforms, or support both. It’s telling, though, that Microsoft itself admits at least internally that it Windows 10 Cloud-based laptops won’t quite measure up to the competition. In its comparison of the two platforms, the document notes that Chromebooks are faster to cold-boot to a login screen (20 seconds to 15 seconds) as well as from the sign-in screen to the desktop (15 seconds versus 10 seconds). We’ll have to see how Microsoft spins this: Selling something that's almost-as-good as the competition doesn’t sound like much of a pitch.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Google vs. Ad Blockers: If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em Google is reportedly developing an ad blocker for its popular Chrome web browser. But why? Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Apr 23, 2017 at 3:00PM Google is the biggest internet-advertising company in the world, so it's ironic that the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary is considering including an ad blocking feature in its popular Chrome web browser. Ad blocking has grown increasingly popular over the last few years; roughly 26% of U.S. internet users now employ ad-blocking software. Google may be looking to preempt further adoption of ad blockers by automatically disabling the most annoying kinds of ads on the web, like full-screen takeovers and autoplay video ads. Google is backed by the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, and media organizations, along with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The rise of ad blocking is a threat to companies like Google and Facebook that generate nearly all of their revenue from online advertising. If they can control the ad-blocking software, they can control which ads get blocked and which ones don't, a win-win-win for internet users, publishers, and advertising companies. Image source: Getty Images. Don't block every ad, just the bad ones Google has already built functions into its Chrome browser to block ads that result in the biggest drains on laptop and smartphone batteries. The updates it's discussing with publishers and the Coalition will take another step, to block the ad formats that overwhelmingly lead users to seek out ad blockers. Publishers are drawn to ads like full-screen takeovers and autoplay videos because they typically fetch higher rates than other ad units. However, they can also ruin the user experience, potentially leading to high website abandonment rates. Top publishers understand this and generally stay away from these annoying formats, but with the proliferation of small publishers through Facebook, it's more and more common to come across these types of ads. The Coalition for Better Ads is in the process of setting standards for publishers to follow. Google's Chrome browser is just one vehicle through which it will enforce those standards. Chrome is used by 58.6% of all web users; with that much of the market, Google should be able to get most publishers to adopt the standards, for fear they'll miss out on a lot of potential ad revenue. Won't Google be hurting itself? Google is one of the biggest digital display advertisers in the world, but most of its ad revenue actually comes from its search business. Google doesn't break out search specifically, but its owned and operated properties accounted for over 80% of its total ad revenue last quarter. The other 20% came from its ad network, which it splits with publishers. Google's own websites have increased their share of Google's total ad revenue in recent years, as people spend more time watching ads on YouTube and searching Google on their mobile devices. While paid clicks on network member sites continue to increase (despite the proliferation of ad blockers), Google's revenue per click is declining. Facebook actually generates more revenue from display ads than Google. But Facebook investors shouldn't be worried either. Facebook's main ad unit -- native News Feed ads -- certainly falls within the standards set forth by the coalition. Moreover, most of Facebook's audience accesses its platform through a dedicated mobile app, which is immune to ad-blocking services like the one Google is reportedly developing. Even blocking the most annoying kinds of ads, Google can still let nonintrusive ads through. That's better for both Google and publishers than third-party software, which generally blocks any and all ads. If Google integrates ad blocking into Chrome, it could stop many consumers from going for those third-party apps, saving some revenue for Google and its network partners.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Published:April 24, 2017 2:57 am Happy Birthday, Rajkumar. Google Doodle honours Kannada actor on what would have been his 88th birth anniversary. A known face in Indian cinema, Kannada actor and singer Rajkumar was born on April 24, 1929, as Singanalluru Puttaswamayya Muthuraju. Widely acknowledged as one of India’s finest actors, Rajkumar is still fondly and popularly referred to as Nata Saarvabhouma (Emperor of Actors), Bangarada Manushya (Man of Gold), Vara Nata (Gifted Actor) and Rajanna (Brother Raj). Today would have been his 88th birthday, and the team over at Google decided to commemorate his anniversary with a vibrantly painted doodle of a larger-than-life Rajkumar beaming at a crowd of moviegoers from the big screen where his legacy lives on. This is a most fitting doodle for an artiste whose career spanned over 200 films, starting from 1954 in the film Bedara Kannapa to Shabdavedhi being his last in 2000. He began his film career, though, under the illustrious Gubbi Veeranna in the Gubbi Drama Company. Awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1983, Rajkumar was also an avid Carnatic music performer, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards such as three National Awards (one as a playback singer as well), many Karnataka state film awards, South Filmfare awards, the NTR National Award and the coveted Dadasaheb Phalke Award for lifetime contribution to Indian cinema in 1995. Rajkumar’s off-screen life was equally dramatic as his on-screen one. In 2000, he was kidnapped from his farm house in Gajanur, along with his son-in-law and two others, by none other than Veerappan and was released 108 days later. He died of cardiac arrest in Bangalore on April 12, 2006, at the age of 77. Did you know, the much loved Rekha made her debut with him in Operation Jackpotnalli CID 999? Rajkumar is also the first Indian actor to have played the role of James Bond in Jedara Bale. According to the Google Doodle team’s brief, there were several drafts of the sketch before they zeroed in on this one. “Early drafts of today’s Doodle featured different interpretations of the beloved star’s work. The first illustrates Rajkumar singing and holding the white bird from Kasturi Nivasa, a quintessential Kannada drama and a cornerstone of Rajkumar’s cinematic legacy. Another Doodle draft showcases an array of iconic characters Rajkumar played over a half century of acting”, the brief states.

NEW — OPEN Something needs to be done about the lack of developers and support staff or SeaMonkey will be no more in the near future. frg did prepare a "asking for help" draft for the council. He is waiting for final comments and will be post it in the various SeaMonkey newsgroups. Some users are willing to proof-read and translate to other languages before it goes out. IanN will look at it after the meeting (done). Mozilla plans to check in l20n. Unclear what this means for comm-central and the current l10n build configs. Needs to be monitored. bug 1107635 - Rewrite build system l10n repack rules from Makefile rules into a Python script might also affect a timely l10n repack Google API key for Safe Browsing V2, V4 and Geolocation. Ewong/Callek about getting it loaded onto the build machines. Per bug 903439#c10, ewong confirmed that he has the Google API key. Safe Browsing keys are on the builders according to ewong. The build config config changes are not yet checked in. Ewong contacted Mozilla for a geolocation key and so far received no response. The Google API key can be used instead of the Mozilla key with some pref changes. rsx11m fixed a bug to use the Google key for now in all trees bug 1352850. IanN has spoken to mcsmurf about members list. Members mailing-list and council appointments are ready to be reviewed. TODO: Add Adrian Kalla to RelEng team. Overall no change as of today IanN SeaMonkey project areas is very outdated. IanN plans to update the project areas soon. Discussions and planning about the future of SeaMonkey and if we should set up own builders are still going on. frg asked Adrian about his build config. He runs a small setup: 2 PCs, a Mac and a Jumhost (DD-WRT router). 1 PC is the Buildmaster and second the server with VMs for Windows and Linux building. Ratty would like to have a try server. frg misses an OSX try server most. There would be problems uploading binaries to Mozilla servers. Linux distributors can upload crash-symbols. This would probably be possible. An infra architect is now working for Thunderbird. The SeaMonkey project has gotten an invitation to join but nothing has been discussed yet. IanN asked ewong if he could get in touch with rkent. A new TB council has been elected and talks could start. A joint discussion should take place. Not finalized who organizes this and when. Depending on the outcome builder software would also need to be selected. Adrian is in favor of Jenkins because buildbot expertise is rare. Due to cost and availability the generation of daily builds would need to be cut back. The team doesn't see much problems here and a new schedule could be worked out. IanN mentioned taskcluster as an alternative to buildbot. According to ewong and frg it looks complex and Mozilla specific. The Thunderbird project plans to hire a designer for a new build infrastructure in the near future. There are plans by Mozilla to do cross compiles on Linux for Windows and macOS. Not finalized yet. — CLOSED — Status of the SeaMonkey Buildbot Master and Tree Various Bugs open for building. OSX64: busted due to bug 1260362. Yasm 1.2 needs to be installed. (Ratty: Depends on bug 1257904. How to get traction on this?) Perma-busted-red: bug 958812 Linux64 Nightly: bug 1275215 is still open but Linux is building most of the time. Linux64 build: bug 1275218 is still open but Linux is building most of the time. Windows building is done on the loaner. Various l10n and other bugs bug 1293943 which might also impact the release schedule. CZ langpacks seem to be disabled by default, so that needs to be sorted. DOMi still needs to be sorted. Lightning l10n upload still needs to be sorted. [23rd April 2017] Tests have been re-enabled to enable us to find out what's busting them. bug 1295826 tracks the fixes for the Testing Infrastructure. All tests are red. All trees: Linux*: busted due to bug 1350506. While it is 'fixed', the fix undid the mercurial upgrade. So I'll need to update the mercurial package somehow. bug 1308923 might cause problems with 2.48 and 2.49. It is still unclear if it's fixed in later releases. [comm-central]: OSX64: green/orange Win32: busted. Been working on the puppet issue that I've missed the builds. See bug 1345770 for current breakages. [comm-aurora]: *removed* No longer available due to bug 1354818. [comm-beta]: OSX64: green/orange Win32: busted. Been working on the puppet issue that I've missed the builds. See bug 1334779 for current breakages. [comm-release]: OSX64: green/orange Win32: busted. Been working on the puppet issue that I've missed the builds. See bug 1319091 for current breakages. [comm-esr52]: No automation. [Filed bug 1352820] Was broken by uplift of bug 1299500 for SeaMonkey only. Comment from libertyernie in bug 1353765 indicated that it fixed itself (Might have to do with unified sources). See bug 1313304 for current breakages. Notes: Ewong did set up a cron job to do semi regular builds on the loaner machine. The MAC builders can be updated to OSX 10.9. He needs to consult with Callek first about this. Windows nightly trunk builds are only done on the loaner. Migrating our Windows builders to Win2008 R2 will likely never happen. Callek: Regarding the windows systems, sadly no progress yet. I'm hopeful we can get done sooner than later, I'm realistic expecting it won't be any time soon. Langpacks aren't updated when auto-updating SeaMonkey because they aren't uploaded to AMO. The solution requires changes in SeaMonkey RelEng (and possibly AMO). wrt bug 1155011, we already have a Soccoro token. The patches on bug 1155013 require approval and then pushed and the work-around patches backed out. See RelEng page for the RelEng status history. Fixed Stuff Since Last Meeting Google announced V4 of the safebrowsing api. Firefox adds support for it in bug 1167038 which is now mostly fixed. I think the part can be removed for now. Works in SeaMonkey. No additional preferences are needed after rsx11m fixed bug 1352849 but for the V4 lists the Googgle API key needs to be on the server. The initial blocklists (unrelated item) were taken care of in bug 1358750. — Release Train SeaMonkey 2.48 beta 1 released April 15, 2017 — kudos to ewong! SeaMonkey 2.48 will be the next release tracked in bug 1351984 (general beta issues in bug 1328886). ewong will start building 2.48 when he has the csets. Updates from 2.39b1 apparently did not work, relevant for the 2.48 release to upgrade from 2.46 without problems. ewong is on it l10n problems from 2.46 are still not solved. Extensions again can not be shipped bundled with this release. A removal patch has been checked in. DOMi and cZ tags have nevertheless been updated for a future release. l10n problem is tracked in (bug 1231349). Chatzilla and DOMi repack problems are also tracked in bug 1315552. IanN has locale merge working for Chatzilla and is working on the DOMi repack issues. See also bug 652063 (Enable localized ChatZilla builds). Release notes in bug 1336315. gtk3 will be disabled for 2.48 beta and release builds. It will be enabled for 2.49. There are at least three problems with gtk3 builds which may not be resolved in time (bug 1269145, bug 1267982, bug 1331208). A regression for gtk2 builds since 2.40 has been identified but is limited to certain desktop themes and doesn't seem to affect the most current OS version (bug 1312215). Building releases with gtk2 is only a short time solution and will no longer be possible with Gecko 53 (SM 2.50, thus would still allow 2.49 gtk2 builds). Probably a meta bug for gtk3 compatibility should be created. SeaMonkey 2.49 will be build with ALSA support. This has been disabled in Firefox 52 and causes problems for Linux users (see discussion in bug 1345661). Because of the following bugs updates need to be tested if they are still working: bug 1274722 Add %SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES% to the SeaMonkey app.update.url preference bug 1271761 Add CPU features/detection to update URL 2.48 is still 'lightly' blocked on our ability to migrate from AUS2 to Balrog as the above mentioned bugs might be difficult with AUS2. bug 1254401 Discussions if we should match minor version numbers with Firefox are still underway. This would need a coordinated change for either c-c or all trees. All minor versions would be changed and the versions would need to be made available in bugzilla. Lightning version calculation needs to be changed. This will be done at a later date and not for 2.49 ESR. ewong: Suggests the following: Officially release a linux64 build (incl. tests) Start with comm-central trunk. Not entirely sure what is needed to make it official. Need to correspond with Callek. Build an unofficial (contributed build) Win64 build. [akin to the status that Linux64 has now.] Start later with comm-central we need to iron out the build issues, though right now, having just finished a W64 build; but I don't know how the tests are going to work though this will need to wait). Currently tracked by bug 482143. Current plan is to do releases off comm-esr52. No current backup plan other than continue building off comm-release. Firefox plans removal of non-WebExtension add-ons and full-theme support with Gecko 57 [1]. Patches which do not concern Thunderbird could be checked into comm-esr52 (once established) after getting approval too. rsx11m filed bug 1358148 to get status and approval flags added in bugzilla for SeaMonkey Useful Firefox Release Schedule link: Releases Scheduling The next release after 2.48 will be 2.49.1 build from the ESR branch. frg asked if a version of 2.49.x.x is supported to distingush between cycles and builds. tonymec thinks this might work but ewong isn't sure if the infra can cope with this. Several languages seem to be no longer being updated and are missing many translations. They were removed from the website for 2.48 Beta 1. bug 1356294 tracks the removal from the build files. Extensions and Plugins Compatibility Tracking SeaMonkey Council is looking into setting up a separate add-ons site for SeaMonkey extensions. This would fix long standing issues we have with AMO. Ratty and IanN will meet with the AMO people to discuss this. Ratty and IanN will meet with the Thunderbird people to discuss this. [Ratty] Suggests that if we do this, we can also host the Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey. Firefox plans removal of non-WebExtension add-ons and full-theme support with Gecko 57 [2]. new add-ons other than WebExtensions will no longer be accepted for signing as early as Gecko 53. See Basics page. Please only list current changes here. Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey http://addonconverter.fotokraina.com/ This tool goes a little further beyond simply modifying install.rdf - it also identifies a few more other things in the code that are Firefox or Thunderbird specific and attempts to change them. Of course, not all extensions can be ported so easily to SeaMonkey since there's only so much an automated tool like that can do. We are looking for a better(?) home for extension-converter pages, along with a way to track successful and conversion-failed add-ons, and respective integration into SeaMonkey by add-on or manager overlay [3], bug 1145026. Ratty filed bug 1130390 to add a link on seamonkey-projects.org to the Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey. The AMO Browsing for SeaMonkey extension, which makes AMO pages a lot more SeaMonkey-friendly, is mature. It was developed by LemonJuice (of Add-on Converter fame), and Tonymec, who tested it and now uses it, supports it enthusiastically. The author proposes to add it as a "built-in extension" besides ChatZilla, DOMi and the like. What do you think? (See also Bug 1145026: AMO Add-On-Descriptions: Add link function leading to SeaMonkey add-on-converter and filling URL input pane; the extension actually does much more than the bug's Summary implies: for instance it gets rid of the stupid "You need Firefox 10 or later" popups. The HTML Validator adds HTML validation to SeaMonkey. The Beta version is no more Windows-only: it boasts support for W32/64, L32/64 and Mac 32/64 Universal in a single XPI. It does not officially support trunk builds but in Tonymec's experience it worked with them last year. It offers a choice of validators: Tidy, SGML (same algorithm as the W3C validator but client-side) or both. Caveat: The toolbar button gives no results for HTML5, you need View Source for that. See the developer's site for details. In Gecko 52 obsolete toolkit parts were removed in bug 1312143. This may cause problems with older add-ons when SeaMonkey 2.49 hits the road. The 2.49 release notes should mention it. Chatzilla and DOMi were affected and were fixed. 2.x (Last, Current, Next) SeaMonkey Statistics can be viewed at https://dataviz.mozilla.org Across all channels we have an approximate ADU of 120k. Ratty suggests embedding these graphs somewhere on seamonkey-projects.org or https://dev.seamonkey.at bug 1133728 Look at embedding dataviz information into the SeaMonkey website. Links are broken again. Dataviz views now needs a SSO login. We need to find out how to expose a limited view for public consumption bug 1173006.

Frg was distracted by other bugs and tasks and didn't look into it yet. See: New Firefox Sync has landed in Firefox Nightly. Tracked in: bug 998807 Sync account creation or device pairing fails with exception in BrowserIDManager. bug 1003434 Add support for about:sync-progress. As an alternative to porting sync setting up a sync 1.1 server might work. Sync 1.1 has been removed from the mozilla source tree. If we want sysnc 1.1 to work we need to fork it.

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) BusyCal 2/Google Calendar Users Should Upgrade by Adam C. Engst We’re fans of BusyCal, the replacement for Apple’s Calendar app from BusyMac. The company has announced that on 20 April 2017, Google will no longer allow apps to sign in to Google Calendar using “web-views,” basically embedded mini-browsers. Instead, all apps will have to send sign-in requests out to a full Web browser. This change doesn’t affect the current BusyCal 3, but it will prevent the older BusyCal 2 from connecting to Google Calendar entirely. There are three possibilities for those still using BusyCal 2: If you sync with Google Calendar and want to keep using BusyCal, you have to upgrade to BusyCal 3. If you sync with Google Calendar, but either don’t want to pay for the upgrade or are using OS X 10.10 Yosemite or earlier, falling back to Apple’s Calendar app is likely the easiest course of action. If you don’t sync with Google Calendar at all, you don’t have to do anything — BusyCal 2 will continue to work fine. The upgrade to BusyCal 3 costs $29.99 for existing customers, or, if you purchased BusyCal 2 after 1 March 2016, the upgrade is free. BusyMac provides full instructions on how to get the upgrade pricing and perform the upgrade. BusyCal 3 requires 10.11 El Capitan or later. BusyCal 3 improves on BusyCal 2 in numerous ways, including: Alerts that are sensitive to travel time and traffic conditions A redesigned menu bar app that provides a mini-month calendar Inline display of timed to-dos with other calendar events Quick entry of events and to-dos using natural language See “BusyCal Updates Mac Calendar Alternative, Expands to iOS” (1 July 2016) for more on what BusyCal 3 has to offer.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. A change in Google Calendar will make it incompatible with BusyCal 2 as of 20 April 2017. The solution is to upgrade to BusyCal 3, if possible. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Derek Roff   2017-04-11 22:32 I bought BusyCal on the recommendation of TidBITS, and upgraded to BusyCal 2, again following your recommendation. It was a competent program for me, but I never got that excited about it. I had some trouble with the way it handles time zones when I travel, and had a bad customer service/tech support experience in trying to solve those problems. When BusyCal told me that I needed to pay for yet another upgrade, I started to reconsider my calendar options. I've also had Fantastical 1, which I bought after a TidBITS review. It was a bit quirky, but I like the menu bar widget and the natural language input options, so I used it to input many of my calendar events, while using BusyCal to view the calendar. Facing the BusyCal upgrade decision, I contacted Fantastical, and discussed some of the things I wanted from a calendar, asking whether Fantastical 2 addressed my concerns. I got a detailed and useful response. They also told me about their current 20% off sale. I decided to upgrade to Fantastical 2.3.x. I've been very happy with the change. Fantastical does a number of things in ways that I like. Their training videos are short, focused, and informative. Technical support has been very good, quick to respond, and helpful. I have no connection with the company, except as a satisfied customer, who would like to see them succeed. If you are unsure about upgrading to BusyCal, take a look at Fantastical, and see if it appeals to you. Reply Christopher Ruebeck  2017-04-18 06:57 I'll have to look at Fantastical based on Derek's comment. I've stuck with Apple's Calendar after trying BusyCal because Apple displays overlapping events so nicely. (I admit—with a nod to another article in this issue— that overlapping events are less important to me now that the three kids are out of the house, but my wife and I still view each other's events.) A feature of BusyCal that I wish Apple would follow is allowing different time zones for the start and end of a given event. Right? Not many things are more confusing than entering a flight arrival and departure when crossing time zones. Reply rex wilson  2017-04-22 17:35 my version of busycal 2 is still working with google as of 22-Apr. Anybody know if somehow BusyCal misunderstood Google's new requirements, and if this will keep working afterall? Or maybe Google dealyed the change? I didn't want to pay $30 for an "upgrade" to a new version of busycal which offers no improvements, and which has drawn much criticism for being harder to use than the classic version 2. I figured I'd keep running v2 until it broke, at which point I'd go to Apple's calendar (and, by the way, I would have been happy to pay $5 for the repair to v2 for google signin, but $30 for something Apple gives away free didn't seem to make asense). Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-23 13:28 I talked with John Chaffee at BusyMac about this, and Google was utterly clear about the date and what would happen — here's a link to their developer post: http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/08/modernizing-oauth-interactions-in-native-apps.html John is checking into what Google has or has not done. Regardless, the upgrade from BusyCal 2 to BusyCal 3 is far more than just compatibility with OAuth, as outlined in the article. There's certainly nothing stopping you from switching back to Calendar (personally, I hate Calendar with a passion), but I presume you bought BusyCal originally for a reason.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares88 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Impulse_Vigil I'm not seeing it on the mobile app, dunno if it's visible on desktop or the site, or if they just hide it somehow... The settings page does say Drive tho, it's kinda weird. Not even sure whether they're counting this towards one's Google account storage or what. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. Impulse_Vigil You polled Pixel users huh? abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Gen. Chang It's more than just dev preview of O, it started after an update to nougat, 7.1.x and carried over. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Gen. Chang Yes, pixel only does back ups of more items than std. flagship phones. It's new too, which could be why alot of Pixel owners are experiencing bugs. HTC has their own way of backing up SMS and Call history, but I use a very good third party app for that. Google backs up most, including my contacts, but you need to make sure online in your Google account for that option. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen.

Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

Rob Pegoraro, USA TODAY Sunday, April 23, 2017 Credit: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney If you've lost your Gmail password, here's what to do. comments Q. I forgot to the password to my Gmail account and also no longer have the “recovery email” account I specified when I created the account. How can I get back into my Gmail? A. Everybody forgets passwords, but Gmail’s can be easier to misplace mentally because the site doesn’t nag you for your password every day—if Google sees you connecting from the same computer and location as before, it will assume it’s still you. The usual password-reset method has Google sending a message to the backup email address you designated when you set up your account. But what if that second “recovery” mail account no longer exists? Freelance journalist Jesse Emspak had to deal with that issue recently. He forgot the password he’d just changed on his Gmail, then realized his recovery address was a Verizon account he’d closed at least four years ago. In that case, you’re not out of luck. But you’d better have a good memory of your history with Gmail. Google’s troubleshooter will ask you to fill out an account-recovery form that features questions about how you’ve used Gmail. Emspak said one was when he’d created his account and another was one of the security questions he’d created when opening the account. More from Rob Pegoraro: Three business days later, Google restored his access, allowing him to reset the password and provide a new recovery e-mail address. This issue is likely to affect many more users as Verizon continues its campaign to get its Internet subscribers to move their Verizon email accounts to the mail system of its subsidiary AOL (which will preserve the original @verizon.net addresses) or see those accounts deleted. To make sure your Gmail account isn’t relying on a dead or dying email address, visit https://myaccount.google.com/security and scroll down to “Account recovery options.” While you’re on that page, now would be an excellent time to enable two security options you may have neglected before. Adding your mobile phone number will provide another way to recover your account if you forget the password. No, Google won’t spam you: I don’t think I’ve received a single text message from the company since enabling that option years ago. And setting up two-step verification will stop the theft of your password from resulting in the loss of your account. Anytime Google sees an unusual login, it will ask you to confirm that with a code texted to your phone or generated (even if your phone has no signal) by its free Authenticator app. You can make one other important security upgrade by using a password manager like Dashlane or LastPass (both free) to save your passwords. These services store your passwords in tightly-encrypted form, and their browser extensions will fill them in for you--and unlike people, they can’t be spoofed by phishing sites that look like the real thing but exist at a different address. If you really don’t want to hand over your Gmail password to a third party, you should still write it down somewhere so you don’t get stuck later on. But keep that piece of paper in your wallet or in your home, both of which you already know to keep safe--not on a Post-It note stuck to your computer at work.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over?

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Must be manufactured by commie pinkos. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seriously, no mention of the blue screen on the LG G6?

The face unlock is crazy fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Excellent! That's what I would use. I'm not worried about someone taking a picture of my face and stealing my phone. Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

Moss federal courthouse. A pair of editorials in The New York Times and Business Insider exclaimed recently that the power in the tech industry is concentrated among too few companies, with both publications calling for a new round of antitrust regulation akin to the Department of Justice action against Microsoft in the 1990s. This argument is stunningly, spectacularly wrong. Yes, the five big tech companies—Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—are more powerful collectively than the tech industry has ever been. They're the five largest companies in the U.S., as measured by market cap, and have been driving most of the stock market's gains since January. It's also easy to argue, as Matt Stoller does in the Business Insider piece, that innovation in the tech industry is in a lull. Venture capital-funded companies like Juicero, which sells a $400 juicer, as a highly visible example. (A recent Bloomberg investigation showed that the juice packets could actually be squeezed by hand to the nearly same effect as the $400 juicer, which apparently irritated some of the start-up's early investors.) Yet what both of these facts actually demonstrate is that the tech industry is one of the nation's most vibrant, subject to constant competition and disruption—precisely the opposite of the market characteristics antitrust law was meant to stop. Consider: The Big Five are in constant competition. The fact that there are five powerful companies at the top of this industry, rather than one (as was arguably the case with Microsoft in the 1990s) should be a clear clue that the tech industry is exceptionally vibrant. In fact, it's not clear that any of these companies has an actual monopoly, and it depends on how you define the market. Does Google have a monopoly search market? Probably. But it makes its money from online advertising, where it faces clear competition from Facebook. Amazon arguably has a monopoly only if you define e-commerce as a separate market from retail. Apple doesn't seem to have a monopoly anywhere. But more to the point, these five companies are in constant battle, both at the margins and in their core areas of business. Consider the following: Apple invented the modern smartphone business with the iPhone in 2007, but Google quickly rolled out a competing platform, Android, and licensed it broadly to the point where it now has more than 80 percent of the global market; Amazon is constantly improving product search in an effort to undercut one of Google's core sources of revenue—search ads that appear when the user seeks information on a particular product; Facebook is competing against Google for every dollar available in online advertising, particularly in video; Apple has its own suite of mobile productivity apps that compete with Microsoft's Office apps on its devices, while Google has a strong online version of these kinds of apps; Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are in brutal competition for the cloud computing market, which itself is disrupting traditional software vendors like Oracle and SAP, with hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate IT budgets at stake. And on and on. This isn't a case of five companies sitting comfortably on their piles of gold and colluding to stay out of each other's core areas. It's all-out war, year after year. The evidence of fast disruption in the industry is clear. Contrary to Stoller's argument, Google did not beat Microsoft because of antitrust litigation; the areas where Microsoft was restricted from competing related to web browsers and forcing PC makers to accept and reject certain software as a condition for getting Windows. Google became a threat to Microsoft because it solved an entirely different problem that Microsoft hadn't even been focused on—organizing the burgeoning mass of information on the Internet in a way that made it easy for people to find what they were looking for. By the time Microsoft woke up and tried to beat Google with its own search engine, MSN Search (later Bing) in 2005, it was already too late. Getty Images Larry Page chief executive officer of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. There are plenty of other examples. As recently as 2007, Microsoft had the only operating system that mattered—Windows. A decade later, Windows is in third place behind Google's Android and Apple's iOS, which conquered mobile computing devices and caught Microsoft flat-footed. Facebook swept into an online advertising market dominated by Google in 2012, and ended up capturing a huge portion of mobile online ads, catching Google flat-footed. And on and on. A vibrant start-up market is a sign of competition. Yes, Juicero was a silly idea. (Although as former Microsoft exec and current venture capitalist Steven Sinofsky pointed out to me on Twitter, the company that owns the similar Keurig drink-pod system sold for $14 billion in 2015.) But the fact that these silly ideas are getting funded is a sign of vibrancy, not a sign that innovation is being squashed by monopolists. Take for example Snap, which is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but was funded by venture capitalists to the tune of $2.65 billion before going public earlier this year at a valuation over $20 billion. It is now causing enough panic at Facebook that the company is imitating Snapchat's core features as fast as its developers can code them. Or look at Jet.com, a venture-funded competitor to Amazon that Wal-Mart snapped up for over $3 billion last year. Or on the enterprise side, Okta set out to solve a problem in an area that Microsoft had dominated for most of the last decade—how to sign employees in to the apps they need to use, without making them enter a username and password every time. Microsoft's solution was designed back when most companies used apps from a few vendors, running on their own in-house computers; Okta saw that companies were moving toward using cloud-based apps from a wide variety of vendors and exploited that niche. It went public earlier this month at a market cap of over $2 billion. Source: Okta Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon. Price competition benefiting customers. U.S. antitrust law focuses on harm to consumers—it's not enough for a company to be dominant, it must be using that dominance to raise prices or lower selection for consumers. (It's different in Europe, where the dominance itself can be cause for restriction.) The evidence is quite to the contrary. Amazon is in brutal competition with physical retailers to offer consumers the lowest prices on almost anything they could want to buy. Google and Facebook offer their services for free to consumers, and are fiercely competitive when it comes to their paying customers—advertisers. Meanwhile, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are locked in a price war for cloud computing. Venture capital-subsidized start-ups like Uber give consumers more choices at lower prices than they've ever had. Antitrust is a blunt instrument No doubt, these five companies are powerful. There may indeed be cases where regulators need to step in and restrict these companies from harming consumers. For instance, you could argue that Google and Facebook have too much information about people's web-surfing and buying habits, and that they should be subject to strict privacy restrictions on how they use that information. You could argue that Amazon's cutthroat negotiations with suppliers will have a long-term negative effect on price and selection by forcing smaller retailers and e-tailers out of business, and look for ways to regulate that. Regulators should certainly be on the lookout for any evidence of collusion between the big powers in tech—as happened with the class action suit over employee salaries at Apple, Google, and several other big companies that was settled in 2015. But antitrust law is a blunt instrument meant to be used in cases of obvious market dominance that's clearly hurting consumers. That's not at all what the tech industry looks like today.

Each of these changes has wider potential implications – right now, they’re small notes, in isolation, but how they play out will be important to watch moving forward. The first is an update to Google Analytics, everyone’s favorite website data tracking tool. Google’s announced a series of refinements which are focused on making Analytics simpler to use, including a new home page which you’ll soon see when you log in. As explained by Google: “The “Home” page in Google Analytics now offers an overview of key aspects of your business’ online presence. Here are a few highlights: You can see snippets from a curated set Google Analytics reports, including real time data, with simple and streamlined controls. Each snippet is preceded by a helpful question that frames the data, such as “When do your users visit?” or “Where do your users come from?” Want to dig deeper? Hover on any data point for more details or drill into the relevant report with the provided link on each card. “Home” is automatically configured based on your setup: For example, if you have Goals or Ecommerce, you’ll see the page change accordingly.” The new presentation features will make it easier to contextualize the data you’re seeing, while also highlighting relevant options to help you navigate the reports you need. All the existing Analytics tools will remain, though some will be accessed differently – it may take a moment of clicking around to find the data you’re used to. Google’s also making it easier to find the latest tools and guides with a new Discover tab, which will be located in the left hand navigation bar, above the ‘Admin’ button. Google says these updates will be rolled out to all users over the next few weeks, so if your Analytics screen suddenly looks a whole different, don’t freak out. Well, not straight away, at least. On another front, Google’s rolling out an update for Google Home which will enable it to identify individual users by their voice, and respond accordingly. The change will help facilitate contextual usage around the home, while it may also help Google stop invasive ads, like Burger King’s latest stunt in which they hijacked people’s Google Home devices by asking “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?” If your device is attuned to only certain voices, it'll limit the capacity for others to access your network. The new process is easy to implement – as explained by Google: “When you connect your account on a Google Home, we ask you to say the phrases "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" two times each. Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person's voice. From that point on, any time you say "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it's you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds.” Virtual assistant devices are set for major growth in the coming years, which will have significant implications for the discovery process and SEO as we know it. Already, more than 20% of mobile search queries are conducted via voice search, which is projected to rise to 50% by 2020, while the biggest percentage of voice search users are teens, signaling a behavioral shift. As these devices become more commonplace, along with Messenger bots and other smart assistant tools, outreach strategies will need to evolve in synch. It’s worth noting how such systems develop over time. And the last update from Google is a report that they’re developing their own ad blocker which would operate within Google Chrome.    As explained by The New York Times, Google’s ad blocker would be switched on by default and would be focused on filtering out “certain online ad types deemed to provide bad experiences for users as they move around the web”. “Unacceptable ad types would be those recently defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that released a list of ad standards in March. According to those standards, ad formats such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers are deemed to be “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability.” There’s clearly a potential conflict here – again as noted by NYT, Chrome has an almost 47.5% share of the web browser market in the US, while their business model is built on ad revenue. If Google’s able to block ads it doesn’t like, that will no doubt lead to questions over the process, particularly if Google stands to benefit from as much. But at the same time, providing more motivation for brands to stop with the crappy ads could deliver a better user experience. Google’s already taken, or announced, other measures on this front, with the coming removal of 30-second, non-skippable pre-roll ads on YouTube and their penalty for intrusive pop-ups. Ultimately, it’s in Google’s interests to provide an optimal user experience, which is now seeing them increasingly reach beyond search results alone and website presentation itself. And given that ad blocking is becoming more prominent anyway, this may simply provide them with a means to keep a handle on the situation and keep users from adding in more restrictive, third-party blocking tools. As noted, all three of these updates are small within themselves, but they each have wider implications moving forward. It’ll be interesting to see how Google uses each to hone in its efforts.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

In case you've been living under a rock this period, Samsung's last phone, the Galaxy Note7, was a complete disaster, thanks to a crucial design flaw that caused its battery to spontaneously catch fire and explode. In an unprecedented move, Samsung had to recall the phone twice, and was eventually forced to cancel the device entirely, handing out refunds to millions of customers, and costing the company billions of dollars in the process. Now, Samsung doesn't just need to make a phone good enough to beat the competition, it needs to make a strong statement that it's so good that people are willing to forget that at one point it was a federal crime in the US with a ten-year jail sentence for anyone caught with a Note7 on board a plane. It's an unenviable position that no company has ever had to come back from before. But you know what, I think the S8 and S8+ are actually good enough that Samsung can do it.   Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8+   Launch SRP From S$1148 From S$1298 Operating system Android 7.0 Nougat with Dream UX Android 7.0 Nougat with Dream UX Processor Samsung Exynos 8895 octa-core (4x2.3 GHz & 4x1.7 GHz), 10nm process Samsung Exynos 8895 octa-core (4x2.3 GHz & 4x1.7 GHz), 10nm process Built-in Memory 4GB RAM 4GB RAM Display 5.8-inch / 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (570 ppi) / Super AMOLED Infinity Display Always-On Display 6.2-inch / 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (529 ppi) / Super AMOLED Infinity Display Always-On Display Camera Rear: 12-megapixel, f/1.7, 1/2.5" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size, phase detection autofocus, OIS Front: 8-megapixel, f/1.7 Rear: 12-megapixel, f/1.7, 1/2.5" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size, phase detection autofocus, OIS Front: 8-megapixel, f/1.7 Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4 + 5GHz), 4G+ LTE Cat 9 (up to 450Mbps), Bluetooth 5.0, VHT80, MIMO (2x2), GPS, GLONASS, NFC, Screen Mirroring Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4 + 5GHz), 4G+ LTE Cat 9 (up to 450Mbps), Bluetooth 5.0, VHT80, MIMO (2x2), GPS, GLONASS, NFC, Screen Mirroring Storage Type 64GB internal storage (UFS 2.0) 256GB (MicroSD) 64GB internal storage (UFS 2.0) 256GB (MicroSD) Battery 3,000mAh Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging 3,500mAh Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging Dimensions 148.9 x 68.1 x 8 mm 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm Weight 155g 173g Design The newest trend in smartphones is cramming a large display into a small body by eliminating as much of the front bezel as possible. Xiaomi was the first to do it with the Mi Mix, followed by LG with the G6. But shrinking the front bezel isn't enough for Samsung, who has also doubled up on the big screen effect by making the S8 and S8+ displays curved on both edges - yep, Samsung is all-in on curved displays this year, there's no longer a flat screen option. In fact the only difference between the two phone models is the display size and battery size. Samsung is calling this new design an "Infinity Display" and it really does look incredible. With no physical buttons on the front, tiny bezels at both the top and bottom, and a display that covers almost the entire front of the phone and cascades over the sides like an infinity pool, it really feels like you're holding just a display in your hand. In fact both the S8 and S8+ boast a pretty incredible 83% screen-to-body ratio (the iPhone 7 Plus is just 67.9%, while the recent LG G6 manages an 80% figure). View photos Those curved edges aren't just for looks either, the curve allows Samsung to squeeze a wider display into a narrower body, making it easier to use one-handed than a similar size flat phone. The LG G6 for example, while boasting a similar bezel-less design, has a smaller 5.7-inch flat display, but with a body that is 3.8mm wider than the S8. Of course, without a physical home button, that means there's no fingerprint scanner on the front of the phone. Instead, Samsung has moved the scanner to the rear of the device, similar to what Google, Huawei, and LG among others already do. View photos Read More Unfortunately, while most rear fingerprint scanners are positioned in the middle of the phone below the camera where your index finger naturally rests, Samsung has instead bizarrely chosen to place it right next to the camera module, which is far too high up, awkward to hit and often results in fingerprint smudges on the camera lens as you hunt around for the scanner. I would really like to see more companies follow LG and Sony's example and put the fingerprint scanner on the power button. On the bright side, you rarely need to use the fingerprint scanner because Samsung has included two other forms of biometric security: Iris scanning and face recognition (more on those later). View photos Aside from the awkwardly-placed fingerprint scanner, the rest of the S8 and S8+'s design is pretty much flawless. Similar to the Note7, both phones have a gorgeous symmetrical build with an aluminum frame and a rear glass panel that curves at both sides to match the front. The days of ugly protruding camera bumps are also long gone, and the rear camera is now completely flush with the phone. The power button, as usual, can be found on the right side of the S8's skinny frame, while the volume buttons are on the left. A new addition is a dedicated Bixby button (Samsung's new AI assistant) below the volume buttons. View photos Both the S8 and S8+ have a USB Type-C port on the bottom and (hurrah!) a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. A dual SIM card tray can be found on top, with the second nano-SIM slot doubling up as a microSD card slot. And like last year's S7, both the S8 and S8+ are IP68 rated, which means they can withstand up to 1.5 meters of water submersion for up to 30 minutes at a time.  View photos Finally, Samsung is introducing a new color for the S8 and S8+. Along with the usual Midnight Black, Maple Gold and Arctic Silver (which won't be available locally at launch) is a new Orchid Gray color, which is a sort of gunmetal gray with a slightly purplish hue. Samsung's gorgeous Coral Blue color also makes a return, but as usual, it won't be available at launch.   View photos   Display Like last year's S7, both the S8 and S8+ use QHD Super AMOLED panels, but by eliminating the physical buttons and stretching the displays, Samsung has had to adopt a new 18.5:9 aspect ratio that makes the S8 and S8+ taller and skinnier than the vast majority of smartphones out there with traditional 16:9 screens. On the Galaxy S8, you get a 5.8-inch 2,960 x 1,440 pixels display (570ppi), while the S8+ has a 6.2-inch 2,960 x 1,440 pixels display (529ppi). Now to be fair, while those specs make the displays sound absolutely massive - and it's true they are much larger than phones of a similar size - they're slightly misleading, because when the aspect ratio changes, the total screen area also changes, so the S8's 5.8-inch screen is actually smaller in total area than a 5.8-inch screen with a 16:9 ratio. Measuring the dimensions of the S8's display confirms this: its 132 x 64mm screen results in a total screen area of 845mm², whereas Samsung's old 5.8-inch Galaxy Mega, which has a 16:9 screen ratio, has dimensions of 128 x 72mm, resulting in a screen size of 922mm². So don't be disappointed if you buy an S8 or S8+ and the display isn't as big as you anticipated. The unusual screen ratio also poses a problem with app and content compatibility. Most apps and the majority of content is made for 16:9 ratio, so you often have to deal with content that is either cropped at the sides, or has black bars at the edges. Most games in particular, play with black bars at the side, so you don't get to use all of the S8's screen space. View photos 16:9 content will display with black borders on the left and right.More Now there is some 21:9 content out there that looks fantastic on the S8, but even that isn't perfect, with black boxes at the top and bottom (although this is where the screen curves over the edge anyway). This problem may only be temporary anyway, as Google has recently started encouraging developers to support a widescreen aspect ratio on their apps. View photos 21:9 content like this trailer for The Last Jedi looks fantastic on the S8+'s widescreen display.More As for the screen itself, Samsung's Super AMOLED panels are among the best in the business, and the S8 and S8+ are no exception. Both displays are sharp, vibrant and very bright, making them easy to use even under direct sunlight. As usual, contrast is also fantastic with ultra deep blacks. The displays are also ‘Mobile HDR Premium’ certified, so you’ll be able to stream HDR (high dynamic range) shows from Amazon Prime and Netflix when those apps are updated. Like last year's S7, the display is an always-on panel, so you'll see the time, date, battery life and any notifications when you're not using the phone. Edge panels are also back; if you swipe in from the curved right side of the phone (if you're a lefty you can change it to the left side) you'll get access to more app shortcuts, contact shortcuts and other tools including news feeds, Quick Tools (which includes a compass and ruler), Reminders and Smart Select, which lets you easily capture part of the screenshot as a screenshot or animated GIF. View photos An interesting new addition to the display is a spot of pressure sensitivity right over the virtual home button. You can push harder on this spot of the screen to wake the display or return to the home screen at any point, even when you're using a full screen app that doesn't have a home button displayed. It's somewhat similar to the iPhone's Force Touch feature, but localized to just the spot on the display where the home button resides. It's a thoughtful little feature that works well and will help users transition away from a physical home button. While we're on the topic of virtual buttons on the bottom of the display, for the first time, Samsung now allows you to swap the position of the 'back' and 'app multi-tasker' buttons! This is a boon for anyone upgrading from other Android brands and not having to to re-adapt to Samsung's preferred button placement.   Audio Audio on the S8 comes from a single downward-firing speaker found on the bottom of the phone. It's the one area where Samsung hasn't really kept up with the competition, many of which boast stereo speakers. I actually would have preferred if Samsung had used the same speaker placement it experimented with on the mid-range Galaxy A7 (2017), which had the speaker on the right-side, next to the power button. At least this way your hand doesn't cover the speaker when you're holding the phone in landscape orientation. The speaker itself is fairly good, but isn't as loud as the one on an iPhone 7. You also get a pair of AKG-branded earphones in the box. The earphones are pretty decent, and better than most stock earphones, but they're probably not worth the S$140 Samsung claims they are. UI The S8 and S8+ run on Android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung's new Dream UX on top of it. Dream is a progression from Grace UX, which we saw on the Note7 and A7 (2017). If you haven't seen a Samsung phone in a while, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise as the software is both restrained and tasteful, with a simple home screen, and a small tray of app shortcuts. There's no icon for the app drawer by default (although you can add it back in the Settings menu) but if you swipe on the screen, it will load the app drawer. Swipe up again and you're back to the home screen. View photos    View photos Like Grace UX (the previous version), there's a search bar in the app drawer and settings menu, so it's easy to find anything you need. Dig deeper into the settings and there are customization options for nearly everything, from the order and functionality of the on-screen buttons to themes, and settings for the always-on display.   Bixby Assistant The big new software feature for the S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s new virtual assistant. Samsung thinks Bixby is such a big deal that it's put a dedicated button on the S8 that does nothing but launch Bixby - you can't even re-program it to do anything else (officially speaking at the point of reviewing the device).  Bixby is made up of three features: Bixby Home, Bixby Vision, and Bixby Voice. Unfortunately, Bixby Voice, which will let you talk to Bixby and issue it commands won't be available at launch. When it is up and running, you'll be able to ask Bixby to do things like search the internet, play a song, dim the screen, and turn on Wi-Fi, all with your voice. It's basically everything you can already do with Google Assistant (which is also available on the phone). Pressing the Bixby button launches Bixby Home, which is basically Samsung's version of Google Now, and displays various cards and information based on your routine and interests. It will display the weather, any upcoming calendar appointments or reminders you've set and any news updates you've subscribed to. It can also sync with third-party services like Twitter and Facebook. Samsung says that Bixby also has machine learning that will learn your habits and adapt over time, offering suggestions based on your routine but I haven't noticed anything like this popping up yet during my usage period. View photos Bixby's most interesting feature is Bixby Vision, which resides in the camera and gallery app. This is basically Samsung's version of the Google Goggles app. Point the camera at something, hit the Bixby button (it looks like a stylized eye) and it will identify the object, place or text you're looking at. View photos It can translate the text you're looking at, or show you similar images on Pinterest, or if you're looking at a landmark, it can use Foursquare to show you more information about that landmark, as well as any nearby points of interest. One thing I did notice is that Bixby cheats a bit with local areas of interest. It doesn't actually show you areas near to the landmark you've taken a picture of, instead it just uses GPS to locate you and show you nearby things, so when I loaded up a picture of Marina Bay Sands on my computer at work and then took a picture of that, it tried to suggest me restaurants near my office. View photos There's also a dedicated wine button if Bixby detects you're pointing the camera at a bottle of wine. Powered by Vivino, Bixby will show you user ratings for that particular bottle of wine as well as current prices for it. It seems strangely specific to have a feature dedicated just to wine, but it does serve as a preview of how Bixby's shopping functions will work when they're up and running. In the US, Samsung has partnered with Amazon so, for example, if you take a picture of a pair of shoes, it will send you to Amazon with an option to buy that exact same pair of shoes. Unfortunately Samsung is still finalizing the details of it shopping partners in Singapore, so that feature won't be available until after launch. View photos Right now, while Bixby has lots of potential, it doesn't really offer enough to supplant Google Assistant or the various other Google apps that do the same thing better. But it's definitely a work in progress, so for now, I'll give Samsung the benefit of the doubt, and give it some time to develop it over the coming months.    Biometric Security Iris scanning first debuted on the Note7, and I'm glad to see it back on the S8. Like the Note7, the S8 has a dedicated iris sensor on the front of the phone with an infrared LED that works in conjunction with the front camera. The LED directs a beam of near-infrared light at your eyes and scans the pattern of your irises. Infrared light is used because it exposes the pattern of the iris much more clearly, making it easier for the sensor to capture it and, as an added bonus, means the iris scanner can work in the dark. It also means that glasses and contact lenses won't affect the beam. Once the image has been recorded, software translates the iris' pattern into code. This code is then compared against a record in search of a match. View photos Setting up the iris scanner is incredibly easy and is actually faster than setting up your fingerprints, but you'll have to remove your glasses to do so. Once everything is setup however, you can unlock your phone without taking your glasses off. When you unlock your phone, two circles will show up on screen. You're supposed to line up your eyes with these circles but I've found that just vaguely looking in the general direction of your phone will do the trick, and all it needs to do is catch one eye to unlock. The iris scanner is lightning fast, and is just as secure as the fingerprint scanner - you won't be able to fool it with a picture of your eyes. Once you've setup the iris scanner on the Galaxy S8 series, there's also this really weird option to add an overlay to the scanning screen, just in case you want to pretend to be a cat or something while you're unlocking your phone. Maybe it's a Korean thing? View photos A less secure, but even more convenient way of unlocking your phone is the S8's new face recognition feature (well, it's new on a Samsung device, but not so for some other Android devices). It's a lot more low-tech, and simply compares the image from the front-facing camera with the one it has on file from when you setup facial recognition. Face recognition and Iris scanning can't be used at the same time and, unsurprisingly, face recognition can be fooled fairly easily with a picture placed at the right angle in front of the phone and, as such, Samsung won't let you use it for Samsung Pay or even your Secure Folder. Despite this, I really enjoyed facial recognition because of how fast it unlocks your phone. I had to check multiple times to make sure I still had security set up because as soon as you wake your phone it will immediately unlock as long as nothing is obstructing the front camera - you don't even need to be looking at your phone, it just needs to see your face. Performance Benchmarks As usual there are two versions of the S8 and S8+, the US gets Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor while the rest of the world uses Samsung's own Exynos 8895 SoC. In the past, Samsung's chips have outperformed Qualcomm's, so I'm perfectly fine with this. The new 8895 is built around a cutting-edge 10nm process and features four of Samsung's Mongoose M2 cores running at 2.3GHz and four ARM Cortex A53 cores running at 1.7GHz. It also sports ARM's new Mali G71 GPU clocked at 550MHz.

It not only takes into consideration the underlying hardware performance, but also assesses how optimized a particular platform is at delivering a high-speed web browsing experience.  The S8 and S8+ were both slightly faster than last year's models, and much faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821-powered OnePlus 3T. Having said that, Apple is still unbeaten in this benchmark. View photos   Quadrant Quadrant is an Android benchmark that evaluates a device's CPU, memory, I/O and 3D graphics performances. We didn't see that much of an improvement here, although that's just a testament to how good last year's Exynos processors were. It's also worth noting that the S8 scored slightly higher than the S8+, just like the S7 did compared to the S7 Edge. View photos     3DMark Sling Shot 3DMark Sling Shot is an advanced 3D graphics benchmark that tests the full range of OpenGL ES 3.1 and ES 3.0 API features including multiple render targets, instanced rendering, uniform buffers and transform feedback. The test also includes impressive volumetric lighting and post-processing effects. We're running this benchmark in Unlimited mode, which ignores screen resolutions. This is the benchmark where we saw the biggest gains, with both devices recording monster scores. Last year, only Apple's A10 Fusion chip scored anywhere close to 3000 and now both the S8 and S8+ have easily surpassed it. View photos   Imaging Specs-wise, Samsung hasn't changed much with the S8's rear camera, which seems to use the same 12-megapixel f/1.7 shooter as last year's S7. According to Samsung, the software processing has been improved to provide better images in low light, but I didn't notice much difference in image quality between the S8 and S7. That's not necessarily a bad thing, the S7 had one of the better cameras of 2016, even if Samsung did pass on the whole dual-lens fad (Huawei's P10 sports this, so does LG G6, iPhone 7, the upcoming ASUS ZenFone Zoom S and more). To quick launch the camera you can now double press the power button (a feature that's actually been around since Android 6.0 but only now available on Samsung phones). Samsung's default camera app is easy to use, and if you want manual controls, Samsung's Pro mode offers a DSLR-like experience with options to manually set ISO, shutter speed, focus, white balance and exposure. There's also a Selective Focus mode that mimics bokeh background blurring, and lets you adjust the focal point after you've taken the picture but, as is normally the case with this kind of software processing, it's a bit hit-or-miss. The front camera has been improved, and is now a higher-resolution 8-megapixel shooter with autofocus, which is apparently something that front-facing cameras have never had before. The autofocus works pretty well, and means you don't have to tap the screen to focus on your face. Image quality from the S8's rear camera is consistently good, with crisp details across the entire image, accurate colors and good contrast. Low-light performance is also surprisingly good, with relatively bright photos, reasonably fast auto-focus and an acceptable amount of noise.

Recently, Samsung has been trying to allay fears of the S8 suffering the same fiery fate as the Note7 by publicizing its new eight-point safety check, but honestly, we won't know how safe the S8 is until after the phone is released and has been in public hands for a while. Personally, I'd be very surprised if the S8 shared the same fate as the Note7 just because of what it would mean to Samsung if it did explode. The company has put a lot of time and effort into making sure the S8 is safe to use, so a repeat performance immediately after the Note7 would pretty much be the end for Samsung. In our video looping battery benchmark, the S8 lasted just short of twelve hours and the S8+ lasted thirteen and a half, both of which are actually slightly shorter than last year's S7 and S7 Edge. Nevertheless, that's still above average compared to many other smartphones, and in day-to-day usage, I had more than enough battery life remaining at the end of the day. View photos Samsung has redesigned the wireless charging on the S8 and it now charges much faster. Unfortunately I wasn't able to test it for this review but it should now be pretty close to wired charging with Samsung's adaptive fast charger (which takes about 90 minutes to fully charge from empty). The much longer charging time was the one drawback to wireless charging in the past, so this is a very welcome upgrade. Conclusion The S8 and S8+ are exactly what Samsung needed right now. Their gorgeous, all-display designs are a breath of fresh air in a stagnating smartphone industry that makes me feel like the future has finally arrived. While Samsung wasn't the first to do a nearly bezel-less phone, its execution on the S8 and S8+ are far superior to its rivals, with the curved edges keeping the phones small enough to easily use one-handed,  and without sacrificing important features like an IP68 build and expandable storage. I rarely get excited about new smartphones anymore, but I can honestly say it's been a joy to use the S8+ for the past week. Once you've used the S8 or S8+ for a few days, all other phones just seem a tad boring in comparison; a lot has to do with the wow-factor of the phone's new design and Infinity Display that grabs your attention like no other device. The display, camera, and benchmark performance are all top-notch too and, while battery life has taken a slight hit compared to last year's models, the S8 and S8+ are still ahead of most of its competition. And while Samsung's new Bixby assistant isn't all that great right now, there's plenty of potential there, and I'm excited to see what updates Samsung rolls out for it within the next few months.  Really, the only negative to the S8 is a poorly positioned fingerprint scanner, and even that can be avoided if you just use the superior Iris scanner or the more convenient facial recognition all the time.   Choosing between the Galaxy S8 and S8+ As mentioned before, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ differ only in display size and battery life, so which one should you choose? In the US, the S8+ seems to be drawing more interest, but based on the chatter on our own forums, Singaporeans seem to be more excited by the more compact S8. Having tried both phones, the Galaxy S8 is a more natural fit for one-handed use and it's our recommended choice. It's also worth noting that the the Galaxy S8 models cost up to S$200 more than their predecessors, which is a significant step up in cost. While we fully appreciate the amazing design of the device that could warrant the extra cost, it's also a little concerning that the larger Galaxy S8+ model costs S$1,298, which is a fair bit more than what the Galaxy S7 Edge  (S$1,098) and Note7 (S$1,168). The Galaxy S8 costs S$1,148, which is also a little pricier than the standard S7 (S$998). Not only is the Galaxy S8+ much more expensive and is very similar to the Galaxy S8, but it also lost an opportunity to distinguish itself and perhaps pander towards the Note based series with the gap left by the missing Note7 model. Perhaps with some form of 'lite' variant of the S Pen/stylus functions? That's up to Samsung to figure things out, but with the limited differentiation and steeper price, the S8+ would only be appreciated by users with large hands and those looking for a tablet-like screen size to perform more multi-tasking or simply to better enjoy the Infinity Display in all its glory. For the above reasons combined, we feel the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a better option for most people and all things considered from our review, we bestow it our Editor's Choice recommendation. If you need a high-end Android smartphone at this point of time with an immediately appreciable wow-factor, and one that excels all around, there's really no other phone like the Galaxy S8.   The complete Galaxy S8 ecosystem Let's not forget that the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone is just part of a bigger lifestyle equation and Samsung has more complimentary devices to go with your phone:- Gear VR with Controller: This is an updated Gear VR kit designed for the newer generation devices to appreciate the expanding VR content ecosystem that Samsung has championed with its ecosystem partners.

The ad for the Google device last for just over half a minute, and shows off its capability to support and recognise multiple users. The couple featured in the ad, Ross and Alex, both ask the device what is happening in their work days. They do this while their kids look on, eating breakfast. In the end, Ross realises he has a free morning and offers to take the kids to school. The fact that the ad makes no big deal of the same-sex couple featured is pretty important. Check out the show but sweet ad below: Google for the past couple of years has done something pretty cool for millions of people who might not be able to go to a Pride event in person. For millions of people around the globe who can’t get to a Pride celebration last Pride Month, Google unveiled #Prideforeveryone. Google Street View blurred out this cow’s face – for privacy, obviously. A Google hangout for LGBT families is a small beacon of hope in the aftermath of Donald Trump becoming President-Elect of the United States. The company has often supported Pride, and made a stand against discrimination within its ranks and around the world. This new ad is by no means the firs time Google has featured a gay couple in its ad. Last year, without causing a fuss, a nice ad for Google Calendar featured a gay guy breaking up, getting over it, and then meeting someone new.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares135 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. justmy2pennies2012 With BK filings, there is a "window" (0-6 months) where payments are reviewed to make it fair/equal for all creditors. Basically, if you paid some a higher percentage than others, they may have to pay money back into a "pool" so other creditors can benefit. Also, they are different classes of creditors and investors. Tax and other Government Agencies Shareholders and secured creditors (lienholders) Other Liabilities and Payroll (everybody else). Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. justmy2pennies2012 for a debit transaction, maybe 60-90 days. Credit, it wasn't "fraud" plus if you are past 90 days, good luck with that. Banks will only reverse if they can reasonably get the money back. Under BK, the assets are frozen , so this is slim and none. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It may be anecdotal, but I got Bank of America to do a chargeback for me in July of 2014. A company that was holding a 5K here in 2013 was unable to run it on the day of due to a fire, so instead of rescheduling it they just said everyone would get to do it free the next year. However in July the next year they went bankrupt and closed. After explaining the situation to my bank they reversed the charge that was by then nearly 2 years old for me no problem. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. Jrbl I also 'pre ordered', but on black Friday in 2015, because they were offering a "pay when it ships" black Friday deal so fortunately, I wasn't charged either. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Regardless, bad news for backers. abqnm Should have hired the people behind Saygus. Barry Kaufman All of these credit card replacement concepts are eventually going to die out. Apple Pay and Android Pay make way more sense in the long run simply because you already have your phone. Cory S and I'm not really eager to hand it to my waitress. Aaron On table kiosks like you see at some chain restaurants already. I haven't seen one with tap and pay yet but it's probably only a matter of time. Cory S Those are neat, but I don't think you really got my point. They will never be ubiquitous. Especially at higher end eateries and bars. Heck, a good time to do something like that would had been during the chip conversion for POS systems...but most of the places I go to replaced their systems with ones that you still have to hand them your card for them to insert in a terminal behind the counter. I'm not saying Plastc would had been perfect (frankly I think it was always a scam). or had even worked well at all being how hard it would had been for them to get access to EMV encryption data to make payments, but the idea of a programmable credit card is a good one. Think about a card that auto selects whichever card that would give you the highest reward at the particular store you are at. Aaron What you're suggesting sounds good in theory, but in practice I think you are asking too much of the store front. They would have to be on board with the maker of whichever card maker you have for the tech to choose which actual credit account to use. I don't think that could easily be built into the card itself. And if additional hardware is required that won't be much if any better than the slow rollout and conversion to contactless payments. I guess I just feel like the credit card is starting to become antiquated similar to how the checkbook became after credit card tech started to get more sophisticated. I'm not saying that they'll go away anytime soon, but in 20 years how much more advanced and ubiquitous will smart technology be? Credit cards will be for old people who are behind the times. Cory S That wouldn't have anything to do with the storefront being in board. It would simply work off meta data and consult it's database. "I'm at Target load up 5% cashback at grocery stores Discover card". A phone could do the same thing, but a card is always going to be more versatile due to being able to give it to someone. Nicholas Conrad High end bars may not adopt on table kiosks with cheesy adds, but they absolutely might adopt an app payment system like eat24. Nicholas Conrad There are a lot of things I hate about Samsung, but I have to give it to them, MST is amazing (literally, I've lost count of the times a clerk has told me I can't use my phone on their system, and then had their minds blown). I used Android pay I think exactly twice the entire 3 years I had my Nexus 5, now my S7 is my primary payment method. I might not stick with Samsung for my next phone, but after using MST I won't bother with NFC payments again until they're basically ubiquitous. Nicholai Cascio Cool idea.

(GuruFocus) I was talking to my Uber driver, a Syrian refugee who arrived here two years ago, and we chatted about life and death and bombs until my eavesdropping Android made things weird. The phone — a Moto Z Play Droid — would not shut up. I pulled it out of my jacket pocket and realized our conversation triggered an artificially odd response: It was reading the Wikipedia biography of Tony Montana, the psycho gangster played by Al Pacino in “Scarface.” This was not a unique experience. Virtual assistants are snatching bits of conversations, often stuff just overhead on television, and running what seem like random searches that are often crazy tangents, awkward intrusions, and oddly ironic. Or, you know, placing online orders without your permission. Nuisance Or Marketing Opportunity? Burger King sought to leverage the phenomenon on April 12 with a 15-second spot in which a counter clerk stares out of your TV screen and says "Okay, Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The command triggered a long-winded Wiki recitation on Google Home and Android devices — some rascally Wikipedia updaters added unappetizing entries such as “rat” and “toenail clippings” — until Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) blocked that specific voice-activated command from its servers. Wiki also locked down free-source editing access to the Whopper entry in the encyclopedia. The fast-food joint may have been shut out on that specific command, but it got loads of free pub on social media and news outlets. It also raises the possibility of more targeted marketing attempts of the techno-guerrilla variety. Et Tu, Google? Google isn’t one to talk. Or maybe it is, too much. Owners of the Home, making casual conversation, were greeted with a chatty ad for the blockbuster “Beauty and the Beast” movie by the Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). The risky marketing play managed to tick off a lot of people on Twitter. The rival Echo device and its Alexa virtual assistant from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) also aren’t averse to occasionally crashing a conversation or overhearing some trigger words. Some of the devices in San Diego homes went robo shopping after a local news report about a little girl who ordered four pounds of cookies and a KidKraft Sparkle mansion dollhouse by telling her desires to Alexa in her parents’ Dallas home. “I love the little girl, saying ‘Alexa ordered me a dollhouse,’” Jim Patton, anchor for the morning program on CW6 News, triggering auto-purchases by viewers who had their devices too close to the TV. Alexa And The Pachyderm Procurement Paradox A loose poll of staffers here at Benzinga produced lots of anecdotal information about eavesdropping by Google Home, Google-powered Android devices, and Amazon’s Echo/Alexa virtual seer, but surprisingly little about Cortana by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) or Siri by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Anthony Laverde said his 6-year-old daughter asked Alexa to send her 36 candy bars, and complied. Her punishment was giving the girl one candy bar and bring the rest to his colleagues at work. Marsai Matchett got a Google Home for her birthday and realized it had always been essential to her life. “I absolutely love waking up in my warm sheets and rolling over and asking what the weather is going to be and what traffic looks like, which determines if I can snooze my alarm and sleep an extra 10 minutes,” she said. “I want my personal assistant to get my life together and rock out with my on Pandora” the streaming music site of Pandora Media Inc (NYSE: P). She’s also a total fan of the E! Network show “Total Divas” and was watching an episode where a character wondered aloud how to rent an elephant. “Google Home started searching elephant rentals,” she said. Talk Dirty To Me One of the latest targets for installing the voice-activated assistants is hotel rooms, which could lead to some interesting AI reactions to intimate pillow talk. And privacy issues. How secure is this stuff? Alexa, Home and Cortana store your voice data and use it while that minx Siri does not. But, Google, Amazon and Microsoft have mined your site-surfing computer searches for years. You can always turn the “always on” listening setting off, and there are ways to scrub out your voice information. You can also go to Google’s “My Activity” site to rinse the residue of your daily web experience off your life, or just marvel or recoil at all the stuff you said and did. One interesting, if not terrifying, aspect of interactive AI was included in a major patch last year for Windows 10, which basically prevented you from making Cortana not listen to you. Computerworld columnist Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols wrote that he was completely “creeped out” by Cortana’s Terminator-like eavesdropping. My Stupid Phone For a phone that is smarter than me, I have trouble getting any kind of response from my Moto Z when I actually ask it something, and its default reaction to almost everything within earshot is “If you just said something, I didn’t hear what it was.” Since my car broke down and I sold my motorcycle, I have been heavily reliant on Uber and Lyft these days. I work in Detroit, the metropolitan area of which contains one of the largest populations of people of Arab origin outside the Middle East. There is a huge number of people with families here who have been able to find asylum through those connections. I talk to drivers, because ride-sharing entrepreneurs are among the planet’s most interesting people. If they happen to be from a place I covered as a war correspondent, I am enormously interested in their personal stories. So a couple weeks after I meet this driver from Syria, one of my drivers was a retired highway engineer from Iraq who could not believe that the roads in his country were far better than the ones he was trafficking in the United States. We talked for nearly an hour of rush hour, mainly about U.S. foreign policy and places he knew that I knew. With imperfect timing, my Droid snagged something of utter irrelevance. Or was it? It was the Wikipedia entry for a cartoon called “The Regular Show.” It’s about two working-class guys — a blue jay and raccoon, because it’s a cartoon, right? — who have regular jobs but imagine crazier careers. Me, the wage slave, told it to the Uber/Lyft driver (many are both) as kind of a joke. But, maybe artificial intelligence has more intuition than either it or I imagined.

Could Soon Compete With SpaceX -- but Not How You'd Think Sadly, we're not talking about an Apple Rocket. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 23, 2017 at 12:00PM Investors already know that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Image source: Getty Images. Apple may have "potential interest in space" The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, "Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity." After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, "That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space." Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. Tim Cook vs. Elon Musk This all comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal got ahold of leaked financials for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is privately held. Of course, SpaceX's primary mission is to achieve full and rapid reusability of rockets in order to realize massive reductions in the cost of space travel, which the company hopes will pave the way for subsequent colonization of Mars. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. Image source: SpaceX. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. Apple has been wanting to grow services revenue People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moon shot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces "the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made." Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Download: New BixRemap App Lets You Remap Galaxy S8 Bixby Button to Google Assistant By Ali Salman Apr 23, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Samsung announced its flagship smartphones for this year last month. While the Galaxy S8 and its bigger plus variant has a lot to offer, there are certain aspects of the smartphone that you have to live with. For instance, the dedicated Bixby button can not be customized to add another command, app or better the Google Assistant. Seemingly, a Redditor by the name of Dave Benett devised a solution to run Google Assistant over Samsung’s Bixby assistant via the dedicated button on the Galaxy S8. So let’s dive in to see some more details on how you can remap the Bixby button to run Google Assistant instead. BixRemap Allows You To Run Google Assistant Over Bixby Via The Dedicated Button The Galaxy S8 is a very capable device, bringing not only external variations in design aesthetics, but also brought the new Infinity Display which we all fell in love with. Nonetheless, if you’ve got your hands straightened on the Google Assistant, here’s what you’ll have to do to make it run through the dedicated Bixby button on the Galaxy S8. Related Galaxy S8 Costs Mount to the Total of an Android Mid-Ranger, Making It More Expensive to Make Than iPhone 7 The procedure is simple, all you have to do is install the BixRemap app from Google Play, switch the toggle in Usage Data Access and then tap on the Start Service button. That’s all to it. You will now run Google Assistant over the Bixy button. What Benett did was simple yet very thoughtful. He wrote the app to bypass Samsung’s blockade by launching the Google Assistant over Bixby whenever a user pressed the dedicated button. Do take note that you will see a quick peek at Bixby before Google Assistant is launched.

Do take note that followed by Samsung’s recent update, some Galaxy S8 users do not have the ability to summon Bixby with a single press, instead you will need to double press the dedicated button. For more details, check out the video embedded below. Even though BixRemap fulfills the intended purpose of calling Google Assistant instead of Bixby via the dedicated button, it might not be the best solution to the dilemma. Nonetheless, it’s still a neat addition. There will probably me more to the story if an expert version of the app is released, so do stay tuned in for that. This is it for now, folks.

Published on April 23, 2017. 0 Although Google has a service called Drive which users can use to share files of any size, they have updated their mail service to allow users to receive attachments up to 50MB. With this update, users are able to get more files compared to before. Despite the change in receiving limits, the sending limit stays the same at 25MB. In other words, users who may want to send files larger than 25MB will need to use services such as Drive or Dropbox. Drive is Google’s own product and it lets users share files up to 5TB. Then again, there are certain limitations as well: documents – up to 50MB spreadsheets – up to two million cells presentations – up to 100MB Drive also supports a wide range of file formats, including archive files (ZIP, RAR), audio formats (MP3, WAV), image files (GIF, JPEG), video files (MPEG4, MOV, AVI) as well as Adobe files and Microsoft files. Alternatively, users can use cloud services like Dropbox is they need to send larger files. Just like Dropbox, the link to the shared document will be included in the email. Then again, if you’re using Gmail as your mail provider of choice then it might be best to stick within the family and use Drive for sharing large files. The receiving limit update was rolled out in March so this should be available to users by now. The official G Suite Updates gave a rollout pace of one to three days so this should be in effect by this time. Gmail is a top mail provider and is used by millions of people around the world for work and for personal use. The mail service has progressed over the years to offer a variety of useful features to make emailing a convenient experience for all. One of the brilliant things about Gmail is that you can use extensions like Handle for Chrome to better organize your inbox.

Feed me! Feed me! Image: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images By Maria Gallucci2017-04-23 14:22:59 UTC Endless emails, map requests, web searches, and everything else we do online requires the use of energy-hungry, water-guzzling data centers.  For Google, that enormous thirst for water is causing controversy near Charleston, South Carolina, where the tech giant hosts a sprawling data center complex. Google wants to draw 1.5 million gallons per day from an aquifer to help cool the servers at its facility in Berkeley County. The data center already uses about 4 million gallons of surface water per day, the Post and Courier newspaper reported. SEE ALSO: This tech giant just hit two impressive clean energy milestones Some residents, conservationists, and local water utility leaders say South Carolina officials should hold off on granting Google's groundwater request.  The region's aquifers — which contain water that seeps from the surface over decades and centuries — are already strained due to the recent residential and commercial boom.  New industries, corporate farms, and an influx of residents are apparently pumping out water faster than the aquifers can replenish, spurring "water wars" in South Carolina, the newspaper reported. State and federal scientists are still trying to figure out how much water can be drawn without exhausting the region's groundwater supplies. If that happens, large swaths of the Southeast United States could lose reserve tanks of freshwater, making it harder to endure the region's on-again, off-again droughts. Google isn't the only tech company to grapple with water issues. Facebook's data center in Prineville, Oregon competes for freshwater with farmers and a growing local population. In Utah, which just kicked a six-year-long drought, eBay's facility in Salt Lake City uses increasing amounts of water. The industry's high demand for water has worried some tech investors, particularly in states like California where natural water resources are becoming ever more scarce, Bloomberg previously reported. Across the country, data centers consumed roughly 626 billion liters of water, or 165 billion gallons, to cool their whirring servers and power their facilities in 2014, according to the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. By 2020, annual water use could rise to about 660 billion liters, or 174 billion gallons. Direct vs. Indirect U.S. Data Center Water Consumption Image: lawrence berkeley national laboratory Still, companies have made significant strides in recent years to reduce the environmental impact of their ever-expanding facilities.  Google said its data centers and offices worldwide will get 100 percent of their electricity from wind and solar power plants.  The California tech giant said it also regularly updates and redesigns cooling technologies at its data centers. To cut down on freshwater, some of its facilities use seawater, industrial canal water, recycled "gray" water from sinks and showers, captured stormwater, or harvested rainwater. Other centers don't use water at all and instead rely on outside air cooling. At its South Carolina data center, a $1.2 billion facility, Google is experimenting with a rainwater retention pond as a source of water to cool its systems. A rainwater retention pond outside Google's data center in Berkeley County, South Carolina. Image: google Google said it had studied other water-cooling alternatives for the facility and decided that pumping groundwater was the most readily available solution, according to the company's permit application to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The Post and Courier said Google has been "tight-lipped" about its operations in Berkeley County, as it has at other centers. Google has a non-disclosure agreement with the county's water and sanitation department, which does not release data about how much water Google uses or how much it pays. The health department is expected to decide on Google's groundwater permit in May.  Opponents want state officials to wait until the U.S. Geological Survey completes its study on the region's groundwater capacity. That study, due sometime in 2019, could help end what critics have called a "free-for-all" on the state's underground water resources.

Chrome 58 improves Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, breaks sites using certain HTTPS certificates, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 7:05am PDTApr 21, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares163 Applications Downloads Google News Article Contents 1 Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs 2 Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates 3 Removal of old New Tab Page UI 4 Changes to Progressive Web Apps 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 58 was just released on the desktop a few days ago, and in speedier fashion than usual, Chrome 58 for Android is now available. This update focuses on improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, includes dozens of minor improvements, and blocks HTTPS/SSL certificates from certain certificate providers. Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs Google has been working on Chrome Custom Tabs quite a lot recently. In the last update, Custom Tabs gained almost all the functionality of normal Chrome tabs, such as finding text in the page and adding sites to the home screen. However, links in Custom Tabs were still pretty limited. Holding down on a link would only reveal options to copy the link or download it. Thankfully, Chrome 58 addresses this by adding more functions, such as the ability to open the link in a new Chrome tab.   Left: Chrome 57; Right: Chrome 58 With this change, there really isn't any differences (as far as functionality goes) between normal Chrome tabs and Custom Tabs. Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates When you see the green lock icon and the word 'Secure,' that means that the site you're viewing has a valid SSL certificate. These certificates are provided by Certificate Authorities, which have the responsibility of verifying ownership of a given site before issuing a certificate for it. Before you scroll down to the next section because this sounds boring, stay with me, because this is where the craziness begins. Back in October, Google called out WoSign for issuing a certificate for one of GitHub's domains - without GitHub's authorization. In layman's terms, WoSign gave away a key to GitHub's house without asking GitHub's permission. As you can imagine, that didn't go over too well. Google conducted an investigation into WoSign's business practices, and found that the company had "knowingly and intentionally misissued certificates in order to circumvent browser restrictions and CA requirements." In addition, StartCom (which was previously bought by WoSign) had basically been completely absorbed into WoSign - despite StartCom repeatedly saying otherwise. An example of an SSL certificate error. Due to the damage that WoSign and StartCom's certificates could do, Google started distrusting all of their certificates issues after October 21, 2016 with Chome 56 (and Mozilla did something similar). However, starting with Chrome 58, Chrome will not trust any WoSign and StartCom certificates at all. So if you see security warnings on sites you visit with Chrome 58, they may have been using certificates from those two companies. Removal of old New Tab Page UI You may recall that back in Chrome 54, Google changed the New Tab Page to add suggested articles. The new design removed the Bookmarks and Recent Tabs buttons, which annoyed some users. Thankfully, you could go back to the old design fairly easily. However, one the the flags required to disable the new design (#enable-ntp-snippets) has been removed in Chrome 58. We first spotted this in the Chrome 58 Beta, so this isn't unexpected, but still unfortunate. You can still remove the suggestions by disabling #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions, but the Bookmarks and Recent tabs buttons do not come back. Changes to Progressive Web Apps If you're not aware, Progressive Web Apps are web applications that behave like native apps. They can push notifications, share content to other Android apps (and receive shared content), and even have their own icons in the app drawer. Further blurring the line between native and web apps, Chrome 58 gives PWAs the ability to go full-screen. By adding "display: fullscreen" to the web app's manifest, PWAs opened from the home screen/app drawer will hide the status bar and (if applicable) software navigation bar. In addition, Progressive Web Apps launched from the home screen/app drawer now have the ability to autoplay video unmuted. On normal sites, Chrome on Android automatically mutes any auto-playing video. Other features As with every Chrome release, there are several smaller features that are worth briefly mentioning. Here are a few of them. Web sites can now customize Chrome's native media controls with the new ControlsList API. If you're using an Android device with a mouse, clicking inside web pages will register MouseEvents in the page instead of TouchEvents. Basically, web sites will know you're using a mouse instead of a touch screen. Sites can now use the CSS color-gamut media query to detect the approximate range of colors supported by Chrome and the device it's running on. Chrome 58 supports trailing commas in Javascript, for parameter and argument lists. Non-HTTPS sites can no longer display notifications with the Notifications API. Navigating to data: URLs in tabs (doesn't apply to content embedded in the page) is no longer supported. I'm actually incredibly glad Google has done this, because it has been recently used in many phishing scams - like this one. Chrome 58 supports IndexDB 2.0. You can read more about the improvements here. The Autofill page in Chrome settings has been renamed to 'Autofill and Payments.' APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

I especially hope they don't decide to remove the feature later because I've gotten so used to it already. Borgman Have you had any problems with bottom omnibox in chrome beta? Specifically when opening an incognito tab? (I tried twice and turned it off because incognito didn't work for some reason, roughly 2-3 weeks ago). I'd open a tab with incognito, type in the box to search something, hit search, but then it opened/searched in the regular non-incognito tab. Corbin Davenport I've been using Chrome Dev for a few weeks now with the bottom omnibox, incognito tabs seem to work fine. Borgman Is Dev fairly stable compared to beta?! I've thought about downloading it, but was rather nervous! Corbin Davenport It's been pretty stable for me, actually. Borgman That's good to hear! I might give it a try then! Nate I'm on the beta and can't find a setting or flag for this. How did you do that? Corbin Davenport I'm not sure if it has reached Beta yet, but this post explains how to enable it: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/20/chromes-experimental-chrome-home-interface-now-bottom-tabs-revamped-new-tab-page/ pfmiller That looks great, I guess I'll hold off updating until that is released since I don't want to lose my NTP recent tabs button. Why does Google always remove features before their replacement is ready, it's ridiculous. Tomáš Petrík I, for one, am sad not to be able to use the data: URL anymore. If I happened across a base64 encoded image, I could simply paste the data in the address bar, prepend it with the necessary stuff and I could see the image right away. Madis Where would you happen to come across one, though? The only good applications for that I know of are userscripts and userstyles. Tomáš Petrík Sometimes in a corrupted email, or in the source code of some plugin, etc. There are situations when I used the ability. Not many of them, but there are. Taomyn The WoSign and StartCom were actually blocked starting Chrome v57 on all platforms - I had to convert a few sites to use Let's Encrypt when it happened.

Michael Oghia Do you know what the holdup is? Michael Hazell My guess is that they have some widgets/plugins on the site that are hard-coded to load things over HTTP. That, and back-end load concerns, although this is more of a thing of the past with the latest cipher suites. For a long time, even Disqus used to be a barrier. Kavan Trivedi Is this something new?? Any1 else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d9529f329ebbfb0f262209d944e48bb75217db79cbdc1e9af42760cfccdeeeb1.png Corbin Davenport Yep, that's new. Blake DeVoss I want nothing more than to disable Custom Tabs system-wide. Adam Margeson They have their uses, but at the same time I find myself agreeing with you. At the very least, it would be a nice option to have. Peter Miller Much more I'd like if holding down on links would open the usual context menu for opening a link in a new tab, copying it, ... system-wide on Android. Other default browsers could of course implement support for this as well. With that, I think one could already care way less about apps opening links in custom apps by default. F4LL0U7 Am I the only one who hates Chrome custom tabs? I have to turn them off in every f'ing app I install now. I wish there were a way to disable them across the board. I just want my web links to open in a web browser, so that I can keep the website open and still be able to go back to the app without closing the site. Is that so much to ask? Jordan L I'm with you on this. I don't like when apps open the webpage inside the app. I turn ON 'open webpages in external browser' when I can. F4LL0U7 Why are they forcefully removing our only way to get bookmarks & recents back on the new tab page? Seems like a purposefully bad UX. C Scott Willy AP missed a huge bug fix in 58. See https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/ I confirm that going to https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ made it look like you were going safely to https://www.apple.com/. This was on Chrome 57. I confirmed it is fixed on Chrome 58. Hopefully Opera and Firefox have fixes soon.

A Facebook video of an Ohio man shooting a 74-year-old retiree in Cleveland was up for three hours Sunday, April 16, 2017, after it was posted, raising questions about the social-media network's process for taking down objectionable content posted by its users. The company said it does not allow such "horrific crime" on Facebook. It did not immediately respond to further questions about the incident. (AP Photo/James H. Collins, File)(Credit: AP) This article originally appeared on AlterNet. Most of us are active on Facebook, use many of Google’s assets (search, YouTube, calendar) and get Amazon products dropped at our doorsteps. But have we ever stopped to think about the enormous impact these three companies have had on our lives and our society? Well, Jonathan Taplin has given it a lot of thought. The result is a breakthrough, must-read book, “Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.” The book tells the tale of how the internet “was hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals [led by Trump supporter Peter Thiel] for whom the ideas of democracy and decentralization were an anathema.” The upshot is that the dominant philosophy of Silicon Valley became heavily based on the radical libertarian ideology of Ayn Rand. The internet is not the product of any mythical cooperative notion as the public may think, shaped by the pervasive, effectively marketed illusion of goodness symbolized by Google’s tagline: “Don’t Be Evil” (changed to “Do the Right Thing” in 2015 in Google’s code of conduct). The result: “Not since Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan has there been such a concentration of wealth and power” in the hands of so few, according to Taplin’s book. “And the enormous unprecedented fortunes created by the digital revolution have done much to increase inequality in America.” The five largest firms in the world (based upon market valuation) are Apple, Google (now known as Alphabet), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. In terms of their monopoly power, Google has an 88 percent market share in search and search advertising. Google’s Android operating system has an 80 percent global market share in its category. Amazon has a 70 percent market share in ebooks, and 51 percent of goods purchased online are from Amazon. Facebook has a 77 percent share on mobile social media. Google and Facebook have more than one billion customers, and Amazon has 350 million. As their “relentless pursuit of efficiency leads these companies to treat all media as commodity,” according to Taplin, “the real value lies in the gigabytes of personal data scraped from your profile as you pursue the latest music video, news article or listicle.” The value amassed from their methods is enormous. Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are in the top 10 of the wealthiest people in America, according to the Forbes 400 list. Each has a personal fortune worth over $37 billion, with Bezos recently becoming the second wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $75.6 billion. Jonathan Taplin is an insider/outsider in the music, film and tech businesses. His career stretches from his college days as a roadie and tour manager for The Band and Bob Dylan, to a collaborator and producer of music, film and TV for 30 years, working with Martin Scorsese, among others. He started his own tech business only to run up against many of the realities he describes in his book. He has been a longtime professor and is currently director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. Taplin’s book is a tour de force — a compelling, story-driven work focusing on the handful of men who have shaped and essentially taken over the massive tech industry. Along the way, Taplin tells his own personal story with charm and insight. If you want to understand what has happened to our country and where tech will take us in the era of Trump, put aside some time to read this book. It will take your breath away. Taplin and I spoke by phone in early April. Don Hazen: Do you agree with me that your story about the dominance of antidemocratic, monopoly-oriented, radical libertarianism values of the titans of technology is not well known? And if so, why? Jonathan Taplan: I totally agree it’s not well known. The reason is because the tech barons, who are the new robber barons, have done a PR job on America that has been very successful . . . The strange thing is that the one guy who was not a libertarian, Steve Jobs, probably did more to raise the halo effect of tech than anybody. He is the one guy whose company respected copyright. In a regular speech I give, I point out that a musician who got a million downloads of one song on iTunes would make $900,000; and if they got a million downloads on YouTube (owned by Google) they’d make $900. DH: Wow, that’s really depressing. Another aspect could be that most of us use Google and Facebook all the time. We want these companies to be benign in our lives, right? We don’t want to deal with the fact that they are both destructive and convenient. JT: Well, it seems like it has no cost, but that of course isn’t true. It has many costs. Obviously, fake news could not exist without Google and Facebook. A kid in Macedonia with a Facebook page and a Google AdSense account could make $10,000 a week just putting out phony stuff. That could never happen if you didn’t have these open platforms. Also, we all pay more because advertisers have to pay a premium to buy ads on Facebook and Google, because they’re what they call micro-targeted. An advertiser says, “I want women in the Nashville metro area who drink bourbon and drive trucks,” and Facebook can do that. DH: We can even do that at AlterNet — we call it geo-targeting. We’re a progressive nonprofit that’s dependent on Google for close to half of our revenue. JT: Yeah. Well, there’s no place else to go. DH: That’s the definition of a monopoly, right? JT: Yep. DH: You say the real value in these companies and their profits lies in the gigabytes of personal data scraped from profiles as you pursue the latest music video, news article, etc. Can you say more about that? Are we fundamentally all being victimized? What are the ramifications? JT: They are essentially monetizing your life, your desires, your dreams, whatever, and you’re not really getting any advantage for that monetization; they are. Certainly the people who make the content, whether it’s AlterNet or most other content makers, are not getting much advantage considering the size of your audience . . . You are on the bottom end of the food chain in terms of where the advertising dollars flow. For most it feels like, Oh, well, I’m just exchanging all in my life in return for convenience. That isn’t to say you couldn’t have convenience if there were more players in the marketplace. There’s nothing implicit about having one social network and one search engine. DH: Peter Thiel is the chief villain of your book. He is a very powerful Silicon Valley radical libertarian, who started PayPal, is on the board of Facebook, and is a mentor and funder of what is sometimes called the PayPal mafia—many who have gone on to start other big successes like LinkedIn. Some of what he says is pretty scary, like: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” What’s the path forward for Peter Thiel? Is his influence growing? JT: His influence since I wrote the book has grown immensely, because he’s Jared Kushner’s best friend and he’s inside the White House and Donald Trump is holding his hand. He has extraordinary power in the White House in terms of determining technology policy. In fact, there’s even some rumors that Trump’s second Supreme Court appointment would be Peter Thiel. DH: Oh my god, I didn’t hear that. Kushner has always been a moderate Democrat. How does he become so simpatico with somebody like Thiel, who is so right wing? JT: Here’s the deal. These people in Silicon Valley have been able to put a Svengali move on the Democrats just as much as they put on the Republicans. Obama was under the spell of Google more than anybody I know about. Eric Schmidt [executive chairman of Alphabet] visited the White House by a factor of five more than any other CEO, and that’s just the official stuff that was written down at the White House gate. DH: You mention the fact that Sean Parker, Larry Page and I think Thiel all went to the secret meeting of Republicans too, so they’ve got all the bases covered at Google? JT: They don’t have any political affiliation whatsoever. They may pretend that they’re liberals, but they’re perfectly happy to be conservatives. In fact, one of the stories I tell in the book is that when the conservatives and Fox News and Rush Limbaugh were pounding on Facebook that their trending topics thing was being slanted against conservative media because the kids who were running it, who were the curators, were too liberal, Zuckerberg said, “Okay, well, I’m getting rid of the kids.” He fired them all and he just let the algorithm determine what got into trending topics. Which was exactly what Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica wanted, because then they could play the algorithm with their armies of bots that they deployed, and completely push anything up trending topics that they wanted to. DH: Further on in the book, you give Zuckerberg a bit of an optimistic pass in terms of hoping or thinking that he really cares about the four billion people who are not on the internet. He’s not at the same level as Page and Thiel and Parker? JT: I don’t know. I probably would say that Bill Gates’ wife, Melinda, had more to do with him changing his life than anything. My sense is that Zuckerberg’s wife [Priscilla Chan] is a deeply committed humanist. She was a teacher, and I think like any of these guys, there’s probably a little bit of a battle for his soul. The very fact that she convinced him to give away 99 percent of their Facebook stock to a charity, even though it’s kind of a weird charity organization that he controls, is something. It’s certainly not what Larry Page or Peter Thiel are doing. They’re giving money to organizations so they can live to 150 years old. DH: We’re going to save that part until the end, because going to Mars and living forever is a whole final question about what makes these guys tick. Before we get there, let’s go backwards to Ayn Rand. When we were in college, these were crackpot theories, and we always thought they were books that kids read in high school or maybe as sophomores in college, and then we all grew up. Peter Thiel, who is apparently one of the smartest guys in the world, seems to worship the Ayn Rand narrative. What is that about? JT: You know, it mystifies me so much. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have both cited Ayn Rand as major influences on their life. My guess is it appeals to a certain kind of man who believes that he is better than most people, and he’s not appreciated. If you look at those Ayn Rand heroes, they always thought that the average citizen was a total dunce, and that democracy wasn’t a good idea, and that really things had to be run by men of iron will who had no sense of responsibility for other people, just for themselves. They were the kind of people [who would ask], the line that she used is, “Who will stop me?” It’s that kind of pushing, that “I’m going to just forge ahead,” and it’s the will of the power. Like all that stuff we studied about Nietzsche in Princeton probably. DH: Thiel also said he was for Trump because he would discipline the unthinking demos, the democratic public that constrains capitalism. That’s pretty scary as well. Do we think Trump understands that? JT: Well, look, I think that they believe capitalism works best when there’s no rules, and they tend to think that the people who want to try and make rules for capitalism don’t understand it, and so they’re going to just screw it up. What Trump is doing right now is trying to get rid of every regulation, whether it’s environmental or internet privacy or anything you can imagine. He just wants to get rid of all these regulations, because he wants Verizon or Google or Exxon or Koch Industries to be able to just do whatever they want to do and not worry about regulation. Of course, I think that’s what leads to things like the financial crisis in 2008, when the banks had no regulation and they just went crazy. DH: Speaking of deregulation, you write about a New York Times article on a World Bank report that says internet innovation stands to widen inequality, and even hasten the hollowing out of the middle class. How does this happen? JT: Well, first place, tech delivers extraordinary monetary returns to a very small group of people. The biggest tech company is employing 20,000-30,000 people, compared to, say, an auto company or General Electric that employs hundreds of thousands. That’s the first thing. Secondly, it delivers returns to the highest level of those executives of those companies on such a level that Zuckerberg is worth $58.6 billion (fifth richest person in the world), that Bezos is worth $80 billion. In other words, if you’re at the top, your wealth is so great that it inevitably leads to inequality, because what tech does also obviously is eliminate a lot of working-class jobs. The better Elon Musk gets at making his cars, the fewer people he has to hire. He lets the robots do it. DH: Apparently, according to Capital and Main, the workers at Tesla are not very happy either. JT: I bet they aren’t. DH: It was lovely to read in your book about The Band, Bob Dylan, Music from Big Pink and Woodstock, the story of your early days of rock ‘n’ roll, when you began to understand how this digital music system worked. It’s a sad story, because it ends up with Levon Helm, a member of The Band, dying of throat cancer and not being able to make any money because he couldn’t go on the road. Performers didn’t really have anyone protecting them like writers who had ASCAP and BMI. Of course, behind this is Sean Parker, the king of digital destruction. Can you juxtapose for a moment Sean Parker and Levon Helm and what happened? JT: Right. Sean Parker was kind of a bratty kid who got into trouble for doing hacking, and while he was on probation, he met another guy who was named Shawn Fanning, and they invented Napster. Their thought was, Well, look at all these tunes [that] are digital now that the CD is out, and what we need to do is build this service that allows anybody to share their music with anybody else for free; what we need to do is just index it. That’s what they did. Of course, not being musicians, at first they had no idea that it would destroy the music business. And when they fairly quickly got the idea that it was destroying the music business, they didn’t give a f**k. What they cared for was to build this business, which they did to about 70 million users in two years. Once people got a taste of getting music for free, then that made it seem like all music should be free. Same thing happened in the newspaper business. Once people got a little free news, then why should they pay for news? Why should I buy a newspaper? Newspaper revenues and music revenues plunged by 70 percent from the year 2001 until 2015. That’s just extraordinary, the business cut by two-thirds. I think that what happened is obviously Levon could no longer make a living off of the music, even though if you went to YouTube, the number of plays of “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” was in the millions; but he wasn’t getting any money from that. That’s the sad story, and it’s not just Levon. There’s thousands of musicians. T-Bone Burnett and I do a talk every once in a while, and we run into just hundreds of musicians who can’t make a living anymore. DH: What does it mean, what you describe as the surveillance marketing business? You say that both Facebook and Google are in this business now. JT: Their main business is what I’ve begun to call surveillance capitalism. Basically, it’s a new kind of capitalism, which means that the greatest value that I hold is the amount of data that I have been able to sweep up from every possible realm on you, Don Hazen. I’m going to get it from your mobile phone, from your shopping online, from your location, from in your home if you have an Amazon Alexa, with the microphone on. I’m going to vacuum it up from there. I’m going to basically look for more places where I can grab your data. The key to doing that of course is to get you to go on my services, whether it’s YouTube or search or on Facebook, and stay there as long as possible, and the more you stay there, the more data I’m grabbing from you. Now, I take that data, and I sell it back to advertisers in a way of being able to target a very narrow page of just who I want to get to. And it is not just companies that do that. Politicians, as we saw in the past election, can do that just as easily. If you want to suppress the vote among young black men in Detroit, it’s very easy to just send to them a piece of content that says, “Hillary Clinton says all young black men are predators.” You can be assured that that will be somewhat successful. DH: How did the $84 billion Koch brothers get into your book about tech monopolies? JT: Because they provided, through ALEC and the other organizations that they finance, the underlying power in Washington, D.C., to make sure that companies don’t get regulated. If you think about some of the problems that Trump is having now, these guys thought that the Republican health care bill was too much regulation in it, and so they offered basically a bounty to any of the Freedom Caucus who would vote against it. They said, “We’ll put up to $2 million in ad money for your campaign if Trump comes after you.” Basically, these people have so much money, they’re just . . . basically the Peter Thiels and Larry Pages have just kind of surfed behind their propaganda, which says the market is always right, and the government is always wrong. When the government tried to do a few things to regulate Google, they come down on the government like a ton of bricks. Why do you think this internet privacy law was passed so quickly? Because the Koch brothers said it was fine. DH: This question has to do with what you mentioned earlier about outsized imaginations. Musk is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to go to Mars, and Page and Thiel are investing as many millions to extend their lives. What does this tell us about these guys? JT: It just seems so bizarre to me that we haven’t solved malaria or typhoid or cholera, and these guys are spending millions of dollars so they personally can live to be 200 years old. Now, to my mind the whole idea is insane because I would imagine by the time you were 130, you had spent four or five million to extend your life — because it’ll be expensive, and only the rich will be able to afford it — you’d be so afraid to come out of your house because you might get hit by a car and your whole $5 million investment would go down the tubes. It would seem to me you’d become a prisoner of your own longevity. I don’t know, but the whole thing is so screwy to me. Elon Musk, at this conference that I went to that Vanity Fair put on, literally said, “We should set off a nuclear bomb on Mars, and it would melt the ice, and then we could grow vegetables to feed the colonies.” DH: That’s wild. Really crazy. All right, anything else I should be asking you?  JT: I think you’ve covered it, man. I’m pleased that you liked the book. DH: There is so much shocking and sobering information in your book that it should be required reading for everyone who wants to understand how we have arrived at this point in history, and the connections between tech monopoly, inequality and even Trump’s election. JT: Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor friend who runs the history department there, said, “Tap, you’re the new muckraker.” I said, “Well, that’s kind of cool.” Because in a sense, 100 years ago we had to face this same problem with Standard Oil and J.P. Morgan and the railroads. We’ve been here before. The 1912 election between Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt was run on [the question:] what do we do about monopolies? That was the main issue. DH: Yes, but it is more difficult now because there’s no split in the ruling class. Obama was just as tight with Google as the Republicans, or more so. It was easier to scapegoat the railroads or Rockefeller and Standard Oil than it is to do the same thing to the guys wearing hoodies and sneakers, and saying, “We do no evil.” JT: I know. I know. I will tell you, Don, that I think the dialogue is beginning to change. I was at a Chicago conference last week on monopoly, and it was at the Chicago School of Business, which is the most conservative, where Milton Friedman dominated. By the end of the conference even the old-fashioned Friedmanites were saying, “This surveillance capitalism is different, and we may have to rethink what we thought about regulation and monopoly.” I think something’s changing. DH: The challenge is that many of us just don’t want to hear the reality about these companies because it makes our lives more uncomfortable, more challenging. Because we shouldn’t be doing half the stuff we’re doing, it’s just easier. We hang out on Facebook, give our information to Google, don’t take our money out of Merrill Lynch, Chase or Citibank. And often we don’t support local business — just have Amazon delivering those packages, helping make Bezos a gazillionaire, because it is easier to do. Anyway, congratulations on the book. I hope it is a big success. More Don Hazen.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over?

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site.

The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year.

Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is….

Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Must be manufactured by commie pinkos. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seriously, no mention of the blue screen on the LG G6?

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet.

Google Voice gets its first feature update since being revived Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/16 2:17pm PDTMar 16, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 84 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Google News Google Voice was waning a few weeks ago, then Google suddenly brought it back and gave it a fresh coat of paint. That was just the first step, though. Google promised it would continue updating Google Voice, and indeed it is. There's a new update rolling out today with more conversation management options, GIFs, and more. Here's the full list of new features (Android and web) Google posted on the product forums. Delete Conversations - You can now delete entire conversations on Android and Web. To delete an entire conversation, click the conversation > click More > Delete. Note that there is no trash and deletes cannot be undone.  Individual messages in a conversation can still be deleted by long pressing on a message in the mobile apps or right clicking on Web. Conversation delete will be coming to iOS in the near future. Calling on Web - You can now "make a call" from the updated version of the web interface to any number/contact. Do Not disturb - We’ve added the ability to toggle Do Not Disturb on/off on Android. When Do Not Disturb is enabled, call and text message forwarding will be paused and there will be a banner to indicate that it is turned on. To set a timer on Do Not Disturb, you will still need to visit the Legacy Google Voice on Web. Disable app notifications for text messages (Android Only) - Avoid duplicate notifications if you have message forwarding enabled. Conversation archive shortcut (Android Only)- Long-press on a conversation in the messages list to bring up the archive option. Gif image search - You can now search for Gifs if you use Gboard on Android. The ability to delete conversations is long overdue. There's no trashcan, so deleted conversations are gone forever. Conversations can also be archived via a long-press if you think you might need them again. Do Not Disturb mode can be toggled from the app as well. For Gboard users, the built-in GIF search feature works in Google Voice now. If you were hoping for Project Fi support, sorry. It's still not available. The updated app is rolling out, but you can grab it right now on APK Mirror if you're impatient. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

All calls you make from the stock dialer should route through your Google voice number after this. The only reason I use the Hangouts dialer is so I have the option of making voice calls on my Pixel C tablet. ProductFRED No, I want VOIP. Not calling over the carrier network. Josh Woodby If you make a call using the regular dialer, the option will immediately switch to using your Google Voice instead. This IS actually VOIP. So, I don't see your issue. What I want is the ability to receive calls directly within the App without the need to forward calls to the carrier. That.... That is what is missing. Outgoing has always been achievable using the aforementioned method. Ryan Cavitt Actually it is not VoIP. You can tell by enabling airplane mode, reenabling Wi-Fi, then disabling Wi-Fi calling if you have it enabled. You will notice the call fails which indicates it is not VoIP. If it was the very fact that your phone is not connected to your cellular provider in anyway should not matter as it should be able to use any connection as long as it is a connection to the internet. You know like using Hangouts Dialer currently does. Ryan Its not VOIP, its a forward. Bruce Why do you want to use VOIP? Are you paying for carrier voice calls? Didn't think this was an issue in the US. Railwayman I want to use VoIP since I use data plans only without any carrier talk and text. Don't forget that GV over VoIP also work over non US SIM cards, which is the beauty of it. So yes, Google should integrate Hangouts Dialer into the refreshed GV app. ProductFRED Because then I can use my Google number over Wifi or anywhere in the world. Additionally, it makes sense since even native calls are becoming VoLTE (which is VoIP). Robb B. Screenshot of settings for phone apk on pixel XL. Setup SIP account and make primary. Then you'll be able to use GV with VoIP. Currently and always, GV never did stand alone VoIP on Android. Only Apple. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5dd6cf43950d187c0d8498d02da5436a87d23097d32844f6e8fe5202663c1281.png Gfame103 GV was a stand alone VoIP service back between 2010-2012 (Android only). I used to use it to receive and make free unlimited calls before the feature was taken away. Robb B. It was never stand alone. You always had to use IPKall or some other SIP service. Look at the early days of my app installs. They were all apps to provide sip functions with GV. You had to have another solution. Apple app was the only actual VoIP but was never ported to Android. Show me proof that you used GV without a fake sip number from any other provider or I call BS. BlazeKing I only used Groove IP to use GV as VoIP before GV stopped using the SIP ptotocol (rendering Groove IP's main attraction useless the time). What are you talking about, exactly? Picaso86 How can I setup a SIP Account to use GV through the Phone Dialer? Bryan Wagoner You can make voip calls using your gvoice phone number through hangouts at least. Carson Saldanha I'd like to be able to receive calls in the Google Phone app. They allow you to dial from it, but you can't receive any. Kerry Webb You can if you register for a Google voice phone number. Picaso86 Wait... you can use Google Voice through the native dial app? is that what you saying? Kerry Webb Yes you can. I do it almost every day Picaso86 Do you mind sharing on how you did it? Kerry Webb I did this almost 5 years ago. As memory serves, I went to the web interface after getting my Google number. Forwarded all Google voice calls to my cell number. For outgoing, I set voice to ask me if I want to use voice every time I make a call. I also changed my default voicemail to be Google voice as well. There's other tweaks you can do like waiting so many rings before forwarding calls etc. Carson Saldanha I have a Google Voice number already. DaveH I'm with you. Just waiting for VoIP dialing so I can leave Hangouts. b00sted i use GV for work and would always have to login to it on desktop mode to forward the vm as a email to m boss (pain but at least I could do it) now with the refresh unless I am missing something they took that away. Moshe Brevda Still waiting for the international calling rates to be brought into the current decade EnerJi Just curious, where are you calling that the rates are not competitive? I freely admit I haven't kept up with VoIP price comparisons since GV first introduced international calling, but I just checked the prices to some of the countries I occasionally call, and they don't seem too bad. tim242 It's sad that deleting a conversation wasn't there from the start, and is an added feature. Now I'm wondering if heads up is an unwanted feature. It is ridiculous that heads up can now only be disabled in messaging apps if you silence notifications altogether. I also hate how this app just picks random bubble colors. If only bubble colors could be customized. They are driving me to iOS. Jay I don't know anyone who's "accidentally" deleted an entire conversation instead of deleting a single message or messages. To say this was long overdue is a total understatement. Joshua Mize If I downloaded an APK in the past, does my app still automatically update through Google Play for future updates? Zachary Haddenham Yes. Dima Ivaȵov GV also supports mms messaging from the app now ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You're a little late to the party on that one Brad Stewart Needs ability to be set as default SMS app. Google Assistant texting is useless without it. tim242 It doesn't do SMS. So there is no way it can be a default SMS app. It is basically an instant messenger with a phone number attached. Kyle Salewski It could be if they wanted to. Hangouts is set to my default SMS app for my GV #, not my carrier number. So if I hit the send SMS button from the Contacts app, or another app, it starts a new SMS from my GV # (which you label instant messenger) inside of Hangouts. We should be able to do the same thing from the Voice app... tim242 Incorrect. Hangouts is only abke to be set as the default SMS client, because it is able to handle carrier SMS. Before they had carrier SMS in Hangouts, it could not be set as default. The fact that you use GV in Hangouts is irrelevant to the SMS side of Hangouts. Bruce I'm afraid you are wrong. I have been using GV since at least 2008. That's the only number I give out and I had been using it as my default SMS app for years. About 2-3 years ago, they stopped the GV app to be made the default SMS app. So now I can't tap on a direct contact widget and send an SMS through my GV app (and number) which is the only (mobile) number that people have of mine. So annoyingly I have to open the GV app to send an SMS to people. Alternatively, it would be nice if they would have allowed me to use my GV number as my mobile number in their SMS app (Messenger). That also used to work in earlier versions of Android. I used to use my GV number as my mobile number in Handcent. tim242 You are confusing GV messages with SMS. SMS messages are sent over the carrier network used for calls, and are limited to 160 characters. Google Voice messages are sent over the data network and have no character limit. When you send a message from Google Voice to someone's SMS, Google is rerouting it for you. What you are referring to is choosing Google Voice as your preferred way to send messages. That is not the same as a default SMS app that handles all messages. Thisismyusername1982 It does not need to be able to do SMS to send messages from Assistant. I don't use SMS in hangouts I use my Google Voice account and Hangouts its self and sending messages works just fine. So i don't see why it would not work for the Google Voice app. tim242 A default SMS app and using Assistant to send messages are two different things. Hangouts is an instant messenger, Google Voice is an intant messenger. Hangouts also has a separate SMS for carrier component. That is the only reason Hangouts can be set as the default SMS client. Google is going to cut that out, though. They are pushing SMS users to Android Messages, formerly Google Messenger. So when they remove that functionality, Hangouts will no longer be able to be set as a default SMS client. Allo has no SMS support, and the new GV app can't do VOIP GV calls. I wouldn't hold my breath for GV integration with Assistant. Google has fucked up the Android messaging world, and they don't seem to care johnforamerica Well holy shit... Didn't see that one coming twaddington Too little too late, I already ported my number out. pfmiller Are they finally going to fix the bug where I can't use my GV voicemail with my mobile number without either having to put up with my phone ringing twice, or blocking calls to my GV number? It's only been about 7 years since it worked right. Justin W I've had no issue with seeing my GV as my voicemail as a T-Mobile, Straight talk, or Cricket user. Ismael Rodriguez I think he may be referring to how if you set Hangouts to receive calls/msgs from Voice, when your phone transfers to voicemail, it will go to Hangouts and ring there first. I've always had the same issue. pfmiller Right. It worked for me when I first got my Nexus One, but then they made some big change to Google Voice and it's been broken ever since. Computator If you are describing what I think you are, it's the same situation I have and easy to fix. All you need to do is either turn off forwarding to your mobile number, or turn off receiving google voice calls in hangouts on your phone. Just choose which is enabled based on whether you want to receive calls over the cellular network or in hangouts instead of both. pfmiller The problem is I don't want to choose one or the other. Computator That's the entire point of gv, is it forwards to all of your phones (even if multiple of those "phones" happen to be the same phone), and you can answer from any of them. If you don't answer on one of them, the others will keep ringing until it goes to voicemail. That's by design, but even if they wanted to, they can't make it stop ringing on all phones if you dismiss it on one of your phones. When you dismiss a call, the other end does not receive any information saying you dismissed the call, it just knows you didn't answer. As such, GV has no way to know that you dismissed a call vs your phone was turned off, out of range of a cell tower, you just didn't answer, etc... That said, that capability would be nice if it were possible... pfmiller It used to work right, and now it doesn't. That's all I can say. John Repetti Not switching back until there's a migration tool to move my Google Voice messages out of Hangouts and back into Google Voice. JW I am with you. I wanted to get rid of Hangout with one less app on my phone but I don't want to lose all the messages from last years. One of Google's problem is they have too many teams doing different products for the same function (e.g. messages, navigation) and worse part is those teams are not talking to each other and sharing technology. zach v Don't cry okay? DaveH They are, at the very least, in Gmail. I agree with you but wouldn't hold my breath for that migration tool. Alex Wiesen We are working migrating that data, actually. But there's a lot, so it'll take some time. DaveH http://i.imgur.com/gff5bDf.gif How about VOIP so I don't have to use hangouts? Junt Thank fuck they fixed the double notifications Allen Cross ..Amen to that, But as so often happens with GVoice, it's one step forward and a half-step (at least) back. The update borked my 'Always Ask' setting on a Nexus 5. I want the option of not using Voice for some calls. Until the update, this worked just fine, Now, my Google dialer always tries (and fails) to use Voice before finally giving me the option to use the carrier number. . ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Deleting each text to get rid of the conversation was just plain stupid. I am glad they're letting you delete the whole thing. tim242 But not by long pressing the thread. SMH Bruce This! Right now I have disabled all updates to GV from Titanium Backup. I'm still using the older version. The inability to delete messages was a major reason. Until I get at least deletes on long press and ideally bulk deletes from the list like deleting emails, I'm sticking with the older version. Couldn't care less about MMS and any other UI enhancements they have added at the expense of functionality. tintin.92 What do you guys mean by project fi support? Isn't fi basically the same thing? bozzykid Fi uses Google Voice as the backend but you can't use the GV app for texting. There is lots of speculation that Google is going to be adding Fi support to this app since Hangouts seems to be moving to an enterprise tool. tintin.92 What is the advantage to using the GV app for texting? Texting through your computer? Bruce Yes. Plus, at least for me, that's the only number I give to people. This allows me to be totally independent of carriers, phones, mobile plans etc. I can change providers whenever I want and I simply change the number to forward the call to from my GV setting. Since this is the only number that people have, it's essential that text messages show up as coming from my GV number which people think is my mobile number. I never used that absolute rubbish Hangouts, but free texting (back in the say when carriers used to charge for SMS) and a single number made GV a killer app and one of the many reasons to use Android for me. The Seventh Son They still haven't brought the widget back :( I use GV for voicemail on my main phone and really need the widget to keep track of voicemails hopefully it's in the next update. Chris Skaryd Still missing the widget. :( XgudwilX Why would i want Project Fi support? Hangouts is way better. Hangouts makes calls, texts(sms/mms), video chat, hip and cool GIF's..even some sweet ass stickers. Am I supposed to need another app for my phone number. I even have Allo and Duo for when I'm really bored. Zack Where's Data Calling? And removing the damn SMS Spam Detection system that bans me for 24 hours often? Rod Moore "Calling on Web" What is new here? I don't recall when I couldn't call on my laptop with GV. This is like people saying "You can now send money through Gmail." That is not new either. I done that for years. Sending money through the Gmail Android App is new. Adam Margeson The website for updated with the app refresh and, in typical Google fashion, one of the features that didn't make it into the refreshed interface was the call-a-number feature. That has now been added back in. skeeterfood This version also works with it set to make all calls through Google Voice on my Honor 8. The prior version required me to set it to ask every time or all calls would fail. EarlyMon That was caused by Phone Manager and its services btw. mcdonsco I've been thinking of porting my number to Google voice, but concerned that calls may not be reliable/clear??? I use my phone for my business and thus it had to be reliable and clear. Does GV just forward calls to the cell # that your carrier gave you or is it primarily voip.? Computator It was originally intended to be just call forwarding, and the voip option was added later. I mostly use it with forwarding, and have had no issues with clarity or reliability. I use voip every once in awhile, and it is usually pretty clear as well. mcdonsco And you're using it as your primary number? As in, doesn't matter what your carrier associated number is because you don't use that? Computator Yes, that's correct. I've been doing that for more than five years, and with multiple carrier phone numbers. No one has my carrier number(s) Dee Mann Does your carrier still charge you for minutes used for calls and SMS sent? Or is it all free through GV Computator I use hangouts or the Google voice app to send SMS messages using my Google voice number, so that uses the data network and not carrier sms. For calls, I usually answer from my cellular number which does use carrier minutes of course. However, you can also answer calls in hangouts using VoIP, which uses the data network (or wifi), and hence does not use any carrier minutes. That is what I do with my tablet and my laptop. Picaso86 I want to use the Phone Dialer as my GV. I have a data only plan and its very annoying to use Hangouts Dialer. The UI is horrible in order to dial a contact.... I heard people creating SIP accounts to do this. Any ideas? Computator You used to be able to use GV with SIP accounts, but they removed that functionality several years ago. There are not really any other options for using the native dialer with Google voice. If you want to use the native dialer it pretty much has to go over cellular. You can however use the Google voice app or website interface to call someone. It will ask which phone you want to call them with, and then GV will call you at the number you select. Once you answer, it will connect you to the other person. Hangouts is one of the options to have it call you with, at least on the web version (you can answer that on any of your devices with hangouts of course​). They might have the option to call you on Hangouts in the app as well, but I don't have the version of the app that lets you "make a call" yet. Victor Fantus Will Sprint start allowing there #s on Google Voice again? Miles Reiter Do they not do that anymore? I must be grandfathered in. Charley Birkner Seems they removed the ability to forward/email messages with this update. Searching for instructions on how to do this results in going to the hamburger menu and selecting the legacy/classic version, *sigh* darrsil Still no fix for Google Voice voicemail not working in the Dialer app. Adam Margeson What are you talking about? Just set Google Voice to always be used and the dialer will use it. Or, if you don't want it all the time, set it to ask. darrsil I'm talking about Google Voice VOICEMAIL, not Google Voice calling. It's been broken in the Google Phone app since they redesigned the Google Voice app. Adam Margeson Sorry about that. I had read that "Google Voice" wasn't working. Didn't see the "voicemail" there. My mistake. Rann Xeroxx Deleting (anything) out of Google products is purposely onerous and time consuming. There is not a "delete all" messages, only the ones on the screen. And when you delete, they go into the trash where they live forever. You then have to do into there to delete them forever. Note that even performing this delete is performed in the Legacy GVoice, the new GUI has very piss poor options. Adam Margeson Then keep up on your messages better? It's only if you let them really build up that it becomes an issue. I say that as someone who does let them build up. LG71 I'm getting error with updated client. Anybody else? Milan Hollie How to add contacts Adam Margeson With the contacts app, not GV. Phillip Mitchell I got a new pixel XL a few weeks ago and I can't fucking get Google Voice to act as my voicemail. I'm back to regular caveman voicemail and I can't for the life of me figure out how to fix it and I'm fucking losing my mind. please help. Michael Pakizer I have been trying to figure this out as well. I updated my iphone and lost my GV voicemail!! People always laugh because I have to be forced to update. I hate it when updates break things! Michael Pakizer Just got it turned back on!!!

The 33-second ad, posted on YouTube Thursday, shows a gay couple, Ross and Alex, asking Google Home what their respective days look like. While Alex’s day is off to a rough, traffic-filled start, Ross’ free morning gives him the chance to give his man a hand by taking their daughter and son to school. You can watch the full ad here: The seemingly uneventful ad on its own speaks volumes. There’s no indication that this family is unlike any other. The kids are quietly eating breakfast while the parents figure out their days. But that’s likely the intent: to show that same-sex parents are just as helpful, happy and loving as their heterosexual counterparts. This isn’t the Internet giant’s first foray into featuring — and celebrating — the LGBT community. In March, Refinery29 reports, the company debuted the winner of its “Doodle for Google” art competition, 15-year-old Sarah Harrison who showcased both queer and transgender individuals in her diverse doodle. In April 2016, Google also told the story of Brad, a gay man on the receiving end of a rough text message breakup who used a new Google Calendar feature to get in shape and get a new man. The company doesn’t use the LGBT community to only market itself, however. In 2014, a Google Doodle showcased Winter Olympics sports doused in colors of the rainbow in response to the Sochi Games and Russia’s law banning ‘gay propaganda’. Google has also has a habit of changing it’s search bar to support Gay Pride Month, the Huffington Post reported in 2013. This obviously isn’t the first time Google has showcased the LGBT community, and these Doodles and dads likely won’t be the last.

April 4, 2017. Photo Credit: Steve Pfost advertisement | advertise on newsday Jamie Herzlich Herzlich writes the Small Business column in Newsday. For the average small-business owner, it’s almost impossible to keep up with every change Google makes to its search algorithms. Google changes its algorithms almost daily — probably 250 to 300 times a year — to make sure it’s producing the most relevant searches, says John Lincoln, CEO of Ignite Visibility, a San Diego-based internet marketing firm. Latest columns Preparing to comply with new pay equity rules LI firm struggles to find enough qualified hires Founders’ agreements avoid conflict at startups Noncompete agreements overused, experts say Instead of getting caught up with every change, it’s important to stay abreast of major updates, he says. It’s also key to focus on producing high-quality, relevant content on your website that people want to read, share and link to. “If you’re creating great content and following the rules and keeping your website up-to-date, then you’re going to have SEO [search engine optimization] success,” says Lincoln, author of “Digital Influencer” (John Lincoln Marketing; $12.99). Using “black hat” SEO tactics such as keyword stuffing — a practice in which a webpage repeats the same keywords over and over in an attempt to manipulate page rankings — can get you blacklisted from Google, he says. Certainly keywords are important to SEO and should be reflected in your web address, code and captions and throughout the page, but not overused. “Google is really smart about that stuff,” Lincoln says. advertisement | advertise on newsday Still, according to a recent survey by Memphis-based HigherVisibility, 38 percent of small-business marketers thought keyword stuffing was a good way to raise their rank in searches. “Many small businesses have false information driving their strategy in the wrong direction,” says Adam Heitzman, managing partner at HigherVisibility, a digital marketing agency specializing in SEO. To get a handle on best practices, it pays to stay up-to-date with Google’s Webmaster Guidelines, says Lincoln. (See nwsdy.li/goog) But it’s most important to focus on good-quality content and add it consistently, Heitzman says. “The more frequent, the better, if you can update content,” he says. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff Jonathan Evans, chief technology officer at Cold Spring Harbor-based Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty, says he tries to add new content, new pages and new sections to the firm’s site on a weekly basis. Just recently, the firm added a new section devoted to home styles, he says. The firm launched a revamped website in June 2016 and since then has seen organic traffic to danielgale.com almost quadruple. “When we built our site, our goal was to drive traffic there and keep them engaged and get them to come back,” Evans says. Google has always looked at the number of people who click on a particular search result as a good gauge of relevancy and an indicator for how a webpage should rank, says Andrew Catalano, chief digital officer at Austin & Williams, a marketing agency in Hauppauge. advertisement | advertise on newsday But there is a strong indication that the search site is now taking that a step further by considering how a user actually engages with the website (for example, how many pages they visit and how long they stay on the site), he says. Google is also paying attention to how mobile-friendly a site is, as well as what kind of sites are linking to your own, says Catalano. “In the early days, inbound links were measured primarily by the quantity rather than quality,” he says. But now Google likes to see relevant and authoritative inbound links, and purchasing links in an attempt to manipulate search results is a tactic that can get you blacklisted, says Catalano. Going forward, links will still be important, but they will be less relevant to your ranking than a new artificial intelligence component of Google’s algorithm called RankBrain, says Lincoln. RankBrain uses AI to analyze how and why people search, and will apply that information to future search results. Factors affecting search rankings are complex, and Farmingdale-based Molloy Bros. Moving & Storage says it paid to hire a professional. advertisement | advertise on newsday It used Austin & Williams to redo its website and handle its SEO. Part of its strategy was beefing up its local content, including building out pages with informative content for each city it serves, says Stephen Seligson, Molloy’s director of residential sales and marketing. “You really need to make an investment in SEO, otherwise you won’t be found,” he says. 54% Percentage of small business marketers who say they don’t have a budget for search engine optimization, a key to pulling in business through the internet.

Short, AlterNet Skip to Comments Topics: AlterNet, Fake News, Google, Social News, Technology News, Media News FILE - This Oct. 20, 2015, file photo, shows a sign outside Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (Credit: AP) This article originally appeared on AlterNet. Google released its new tool “Fact Check” this week. It is designed to combat fake news on the internet. The move is a clear response to the post-election outcry over the spread of false news reports, their probable influence on the 2016 presidential election and their negative affect on democracy. When a user enables the tool, news stories Google deems questionable come with fact-checking tags in Google’s main search results as well as Google News results, worldwide. These stories are given a “fact check by…” label with a link to a fact-checking site such as Politico or Snopes, as a means of red-flagging questionable content. Frederic Lardinois breaks down how the new feature looks and works in a recent Tech Crunch article. As Weston Williams notes in an April 7 article for Christian Science Monitor,“Over the past few years, sites such as Google have had to walk a fine line between policing false claims and supporting basic principles of free speech online.” As Google has come under fire for perpetuating the spread of baseless, harmful stories (like Holocaust denial articles and racist rants, among other problematic search results), the new tool appears to be Google’s attempt to navigate that line of information ethics. The new feature is programmed to provide links to real media fact-checkers like Snopes and Politifact, next to stories it labels iffy. However, some experts warn the tool is far from foolproof. Andrea Forte, an assistant professor at Drexel University’s College of Computing and Informatics in Philadelphia, Penn. questioned how much sense it makes to rely on a giant tech corporation’s scrutiny to determine which news is or isn’t factual. He told Christian Science Monitor he believes that “depending on corporations to be responsible for educating people about credible information is not a reasonable solution.” As Jacob Kastrenakes notes in a detailed April 7 article on The Verge, the tool falls logistically short in some regards as a means of improving the spread of reliable media. “What this update won’t do is improve the search rank for fact-checking sites or bring their information to the top of the page in Google’s ‘featured snippets’ box. So while this change will help fact-checking sites stand out and have a better chance of reaching people, this doesn’t do anything to directly combat the use of Google’s platform to spread false or offensive stories.” More April M.

Nacho Monreal and Alexis Sanchez scored the goals and Arsenal were dogged enough to hold out in the end. As for Manchester City, their first season under Pep Guardiola is fizzling out.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Prettiest Phone Wins Mario AguilarFriday 2:07pm Filed to: Samsung galaxy s8 review samsung galaxy s8 galaxy s8 android smartphones gadgets mobile reviews 460 13 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink All product photos: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo With the exploding Note 7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that’s increasingly difficult these days: It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting in fact. Besides the intriguing mournful saga of the Note 7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn’t just another smartphone—this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void—yikes! Advertisement With the stakes high, Samsung has delivered a device that legitimately stands out from the rest. The Galaxy S8 is a good enough phone that Samsung can likely leave that Note 7 drama behind. (Though, you know, we’re still waiting to see what unfortunate cataclysm will befall the S8 now.) Ultimately, what makes the S8 a winner isn’t any of the assistant smart features that manufacturers have been pushing hard over the last few years—in fact Samsung’s entrant here, Bixby, falls short. The S8 wins with an industry-leading hardware design that challenges the iPhone’s aesthetic supremacy. The Pixel (right) always looked dorky with it’s home button free bezel, but it looks even worse next to the micro-bezel on the S8+ (left). If you buy the Galaxy S8, you’re buying it because it’s the most beautiful phone available. While it falls short of being completely bezel-less, it might as well be. Though LG released a similarly bezel-less device earlier this year, it suffered from an excess of simplicity. Samsung is way ahead of most competitors you would realistically consider, like the Google Pixel, and the iPhone 7, which are both encased in unsightly prisons of bezel. The S8+ (left) versus last year’s S7 Edge (right). The design is a huge leap forward for Samsung, which has been inching in this direction for years with its edge display devices. This thing is practically all display on the front, and Samsung even got rid of its physical home button. The phone’s gently rounded edges and curves create the effect of a display that’s simply floating in the air or hovering just above your hand. There are no jarring interruptions to the minimal design. It feels like you’re looking at a phone from the future, rather than a tired rehash of a winning design from the past—unsurprisingly, Apple is reportedly considering a similar look for its forthcoming iPhone. Advertisement The S8 comes in two display sizes—a 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 ($750), and the 6.2-inch S8+ ($850). I tested the S8+, but the only difference between the two devices is size and price. Those display sizes make it difficult to compare them to other devices. Both S8s have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, as opposed the more traditional 16:9 shape. Consequently the S8+ is a little thicker and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as very slightly narrower. Nitpicking aside, they’re basically the same size: The S8+ and iPhone 7 Plus (bottom). There’s been some debate about the merits of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio (LG, again, did something similar this year, too). Most of the content you will view on websites, Netflix, Hulu, and so on is 16:9 so it fills up the entirety of devices like the iPhone. Meanwhile, watch the same content on the S8, and the picture will be surrounded by black bars. It feels wasteful, but, as you see in the image above, it isn’t the end of the world. Galaxy S8+’s display is bright and vibrant. Compared to the other phones you might consider buying these days, the S8's OLED is noticeably brighter and more vivid. Your photos will pop on this display. Bixby’s dashboard looks a lot like the old Google Now interface. Besides the hardware design, the other fresh addition in the S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s newly acquired digital assistant tech that’s meant to compete with Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. Advertisement Sponsored At launch, Bixby will not support voice commands, though Samsung promises that feature will land this spring. I promised myself I wasn’t going to nail Samsung for shipping unfinished product (despite what happened the last time Samsung did). In the end I don’t need to. Most voice assistants are dumb as hell, including Google Assistant, which is also built into the S8, but Bixby’s bad enough that adding voice support wouldn’t even make a difference. Many of Bixby’s features seem amazing at first glance. Like the hardware button Samsung has built onto the side of the phone. It wakes Bixby up with a touch instead of a shout. There is nothing I hate more than invoking assistants by name. OK Google—tell me I sound like an asshole! Push the button, and Bixby’s Google Now-like dashboard display pops up, showing your appointments, the weather, and information from supported apps like Samsung Health and CNN. The Galaxy S8 is the prettiest phone you can buy right now. In practice, the additional hardware button just causes confusion. I frequently hit it instead of the volume down button, pulling up the assistant instead of taking a photo or reducing the loudness of my music. Worse, one morning when the S8's alarm clock woke me up ungodly early, I dumbly fumbled around for my phone and instead of waking the phone up to turn off my alarms, I pressed the Bixby button was presented with all the meetings I had planned for the day, as if Bixby’s sole purpose was to remind me that my every waking hour will be toil and suffering. The assistant’s potentially most impressive feature is Bixby Vision, which allows you to use the phone’s camera to search by image. This kind of technology has existed from years—Amazon introduced an impressive feature called Flow three years ago. So it’s incredible how bad this feature is. When you tap the little Bixby Vision button in the S8's camera app, the tool takes a moment to process what you’re looking at, and then presents you with the option to use the image to do a general search, a shopping search, or in the event that it identifies wine or text, to treat the visual information accordingly. The only Bixby Vision tool that works with any level of consistency is the shopping tool, which identified a Monster energy drink (SUGAR FREE!) and a Neil deGrasse Tyson book correctly. When I pointed it at very expensive over-ear headphones headphones, it tried to sell me moderately priced earbuds, which fair enough, I don’t need to spend $900 on headphones. Bixby’s shopping search works reliably. The more general image search capability is a joke, and feels like a failure. The only image it was able to identify correctly is an old photograph by German documentary photographer August Sander. Sure, this is just a Pinterest search, but I’m having trouble figuring out what the hell the point of this is. Bixby’s Pinterest-powered search is not very useful for anything. As for the wine and text tools—they need serious work. The only time Bixby identified a wine bottle, I wasn’t pointing it at wine. The text tool has a hard job, and tends to interpret everything but the cleanest Helvetica typography as a garbled mess. Hello Bixby, you suck. Beyond the frustrating assistant, Samsung’s software is actually really nicely refined. TouchWiz, the company’s proprietary spin on Android, is no longer the unattractive horrorshow it was for years—mostly because Samsung has increasingly stayed out of Google’s way. Some of Samsung’s software additions are quite useful, like the Apps Edge drawer, which slides out a customizable collection of your favorite apps with a swipe from the right edge of the display It’s hard being this hard . Advertisement Advertisement Samsung’s camera is good enough for your snaps and ‘grams. There’s no dual camera like you’re finding on some other devices, but at least it comes with some built-in Snapchat Lens-like filters—Cool? The S8's most annoying quirk is the oddly-placed fingerprint sensor. Less cool is Samsung moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone to the side of the camera was a mistake. It’s not placement on the back so much, which was likely necessary to make that beautiful bezel-less front. It’s that the sensor is off center so it lacks the intuitive feel of fingerprint sensors that are smack in the middle, as in the case of the Google Pixel and LG G6. What’s more, Samsung has gone and put the freaking camera exactly where your brain wants the sensor to be. Instagram your fried chicken dinner at your own risk. In the end, the Galaxy S8 handily smokes the Android competition as the top phone you can buy. It’s prettier and slicker than the Pixel, and though Bixby feels a little unfinished for the moment, you can still use Google Assistant. The S8 also measures up favorably with the iPhone 7, and whether you choose one or the other probably comes down to something as simple as whether you want Samsung’s forward-thinking ideas or Apple’s refined simplicity. Or maybe you want a headphone jack—the S8 has one! Advertisement As for whether you should upgrade, well, that’s another question entirely. How busted is your current phone? Is it broken and you need a new one? The S8 is a great option. Is your phone less than two years old and humming along fine? Wait until next year. What’s truly interesting about the S8 is just how compelling a phone can be on the merits of its great design alone. Bixby is basically rubbish, and yet the phone is a winner. Perhaps it shouldn’t be all that surprising: Top flagship phones with beefy specs are going to perform very well without fail these days. They all have good cameras and day-long battery life and processors that can chop through huge mobile games. It’s so challenging to make a device stand out that manufacturers are employing all manner of gimmicks, like voice assistants and modular accessories, to see if they can’t make their devices standout. None of those technologies improve your life quite as much as a design that plays into our crudest superficiality; I stare at my phone all goddamn day—I want to look at something pretty. README The prettiest phone you can buy right now. The new 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn’t really make a huge difference, but you will notice black bars around your YouTube videos now.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung.  Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Tiuri Elvander Why make this US-only at all??? Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Google Play Store Available with Custom Android Apps By Elena Anderson. Published on April 23, 2017. 0 Recently, Google has been working on updating a couple of features available on Google Play Store, with the purpose of making enterprises use in an easier manner their app. As such, the process of distributing custom Android apps or in-house ones to employees becomes much simpler. Private Channel – Lots of Benefits As such, the famous Google Play offers people a Private Channel feature. This helps apps administrators to host various internal apps for Android and control the access a particular group or certain users have. This feature is really helpful, and besides this, organizations who sign up for such a Private Channel also enjoy some other benefits: user authentication, virus and malware detection etc. Release Date of the Update The update the team announced has become available starting January 31, and it is now easier to make the apps available on Play Store easier to discover and to access for the end users. For example, private apps have been moved from their previous spot on Google Play to the Work Apps menu. This makes it easier and faster if you want to navigate to it. But There’s More Included Within the same section of the store you will find all the apps that the organization can manage with a suite dedicated to enterprise mobility management, whether they are public or private. The update also improved the controls for the private and public apps on the Play Private Channel. The new consolidation helps administrators create whitelists for the mobile apps that are approved for enterprises, according to Google’s own announcement. If you own an organization and haven’t used the Google Play Private Channel feature until now, then you should know that first you have to enroll and use an enterprise mobility management tool. The company said that you can even use their own mobile management technology.

It would have been interesting to see if Rangers could have maintained their improvement immediately after half-time had Sinclair’s penalty, which effectively shut the game down, not happened – and Rangers rallied with a few decent efforts towards the end. But by then the game was lost and Celtic, particularly in the first half, just seemed in complete and utter control. They are way ahead of anyone in Scotland at the moment, just miles ahead, and can be strongly backed to secure their treble when they face Aberdeen in the final.

Interested to know.” Well, Phil, I don’t do many of them but when I have I’ve always found the interactions pretty pleasant. As is the case across our MBMs, I hasten to add, but I tend to find most of the aspersions cast towards my/our professionalism come from a minority of people supporting the big English or Spanish clubs, where paranoia appears to get the better of a few.

It hasn’t been a procession of chances for Celtic, which might disappoint Rodgers, but they have been in complete and utter control even since Dembele went off with what seemed a hamstring pull.

Google aims to educate users about the world around them with this free Earth mapping service. It combines storytelling and AI and moves Earth on a web browser instead of standalone apps only. This means more computing power at data centres in the internet cloud of things. Earth users can explore the planet with interactive stories, 3D navigation and knowledge cards to give users online information about the places they “visit”. The Voyager feature feeds your wanderlust by taking users on curated journeys around the world through interactive guided tours told by experts, including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street and the Jane Goodall Institute. Voyager currently has more than fifty stories and new stories will be added weekly. Feeling Lucky is a feature that will randomly select one of many less well-known locations around the globe for users to explore. It works exactly like it’s namesake on the Google browser. Although exploring the ends of the Earth is fun and educational, many NGOs use Google Earth as a resource or for analysis to do better work. A drawback of the latest version on Chrome is missing the historical imagery and the time slider (available on Earth 7) and it doesn’t allow you to track change over time in a certain location. Another limitation is a legal one. Google is an American company and therefore have to abide by local laws pertaining to imagery which prohibits the selling of high resolution satellite imagery of some countries like Israel. Google plans to maintain the classic Earth 7 app as they develop more functionality in the new Google Earth. Versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software are in the works.

Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.’s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple’s private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn’t respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications.In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It’s unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington DC last month, industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. “It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation,” Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook Inc. is to connect billions of people who don’t have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. “You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren’t inhibited by the hard knocks of the past,” said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra Inc. Also Read:  Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech program Still, TMF’s Farrar said there’s no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its “internet from the sky” plan more than a decade ago. Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It’s already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela’s new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It’s internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet’s Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple’s augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8: Touch ID will be at the back, claims new leak Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet’s Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs Inc., a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd., and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company’s first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth’s surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

Ever since… well… since forever, its phones have been loaded with half-baked applications that replicate and replace those found in the stock operating system. Samsung Browser, for example, is nowhere near as good as Google Chrome. Similarly, S Memo is overwhelming by the standards of notetaking apps, especially compared to the clean and simple Google Keep. And that’s saying nothing of TouchWiz, which demonstrates that the company’s fondness for child labor isn’t just limited to its factories; there’s probably a few toddlers working in its design department, too*. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE As more and more phone manufacturers embrace a pared-back, stock Android experience, Samsung has steadily detoxed from its bloatware addiction. As a sign of this, the company has announced that Google Play Music will be the default music player on the Samsung Galaxy S8, thanks to a partnership between the South Korean titan and Google. Google has made several enhancements to the Google Play Music service, exclusively for the benefit of the Samsung customers. Perhaps the biggest change is that Galaxy S8 owners can upload a colossal 100,000 tracks to Google’s servers, which can be streamed from anywhere. This is raised from the 50,000 tracks that other Play Music subscribers get. Galaxy S8 owners also get a three-month trial to Google Play Music, provided they hadn’t subscribed to the service previously. Samsung is also promising integration between Play Music and Bixby – its hilariously-underdeveloped Siri alternative. This will be available when voice commands eventually reach the public. Google Play Music was also the default music player on the Samsung Galaxy S7. That was merely the product of Samsung choosing to use a better alternative to Samsung Music. This, on the other hand, is indicative of a tighter partnership between Samsung and Google, and is that Google’s recognizing the importance of keeping users of Android’s headline devices happy. For the most part, this will likely be well received. Samsung Music just wasn’t all that great, although it’s still available from the Play store. And while Google Play Music isn’t perfect – not by any stretch of the imagination – it’s certainly a sizable step up. * It’s worth pointing out that Samsung doesn’t actually employ toddlers in its factories, design departments, or otherwise. I was making a shit joke. Don’t sue me. Samsung will use Google Play Music as the default music app on its devices on The Verge Read next: Twitch’s Affiliate Program wants to help streamers make bank AppsGoogleGoogle PlaySamsungSamsung Galaxy Share on Facebook (53) Share on Twitter (177) Matthew Hughes is a reporter from Liverpool.

IP Arrow was supposed to be making the move Mechanic: Resurrection harder to find on pirate platforms but also hit sites - including a law firm - set up to help people being targeted by copyright trolls 'protecting' the same content. Anti-piracy enforcement comes in all shapes and sizes and there can be little doubt that’s it’s an extremely challenging and complex arena. Little surprise then that screw-ups are pretty common. This week’s facepalm moment arrives courtesy of IP Arrow, an anti-piracy outfit working on behalf of clients including California-based movie company Lionsgate. For some time, IP Arrow has been sending takedown notices to Google asking it to delist thousands of ‘pirate’ URLs for the movie Mechanic: Resurrection. In the main, the company appears to have done a good job, but like so many similar operations, at times it struggles to tell the difference between pirate copies of a movie and completely non-infringing content. This week, the operator of troll defense blog Fight Copyright Trolls pointed out to fellow troll defenders DieTrollDie that IP Arrow had reported the site to Google for being a copyright infringer, which it most clearly is not. The problem began in January when DieTrollDie (DTD) published an article about numerous trolling cases filed by ME2 Productions, the company that holds rights to Mechanic: Resurrection. ME2 has been suing BitTorrent users all over the United States, so the cases naturally came to the attention of DTD, which offered its usual critique of the company’s actions thus far. However, in explaining certain flaws in some cases, the site referenced the hash value (B5201111ACEC1E5025DE3087B15DF84612C02579) of one of the pirate copies of Mechanic: Resurrection floating about on the Internet. This was enough for IP Arrows’ bots to flag DTD as a pirate site and report it to Google. While this was probably a simple error, this is an extremely sensitive area so it’s easy to see how some might view the takedown as an attempt to silence ME2’s critics. Certainly, that’s the view of DTD’s operator, who informs TF that he was surprised that IP Arrow had targeted his site. “I was a bit surprised that IP Arrow asked Google to remove the listing of one of my pages. I knew there was absolutely no reason to justify it,” he told TF. “They claim that they wanted the links removed because, ‘These links are facilitating piracy of my client’s work.’ What they actually wanted removed was one of the ‘Tags’ I used to index an article concerning the BT copyright troll cases for Mechanic: Resurrection.” But whatever the conclusion, the problems don’t stop there. The same takedown notice filed against DTD makes matters worse by also targeting yet another website setup to help people targeted by copyright trolls. Troll-Defense.com is operated by Lybeck, Pedreira & Justus, a Washington law firm that’s extremely unlikely to be infringing upon Lionsgate or ME2 copyrights. Nevertheless, the site was also reported to Google for copyright infringement. Bizarrely, in each case the target of the infringement notices were court papers referencing ME2’s Mechanic: Resurrection cases against alleged copyright infringers. As in the reporting of DTD, it doesn’t look good that sites offering legal help to citizens are being targeted by companies with connections to the content in question. “At first I thought IP Arrow was too stupid to understand what a hash file is. But after seeing that they also tried to remove search listings to publically available court documents, it looks like an effort to hide information concerning their copyright trolling operation,” DTD’s operator says. “They are probably of the opinion that if you throw enough crap at a target, something is eventually going to stick.” DTD also expressed concern that considering the volumes of notices being received by Google, it’s likely that innocent sites will fall victim to errors like these. It turns out that those concerns are well founded. Torrent-Defense has been targeted by IP Arrow on several occasions (1,2,3), with Google delisting pages 100% of the time. This hasn’t pleased lawyer Benjamin Justus, who operates the site for Lybeck, Pedreira & Justus. “With courts and consumers already concerned that mass copyright suits by ME2 and its affiliates are being pursued in arbitrary fashion, I think that ME2’s agents’ targeting innocent parties with baseless takedown notices will only further the skepticism that these companies are not engaged in legitimate enforcement efforts,” he concludes.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 296 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares513 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 24 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $136.99 ($163 off) from eBay 2017/04/23 12:36pm PDTApr 23, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Get a refurbished UE MEGABOOM for just $129.99 at Best Buy ($170 off MSRP) 2017/04/23 12:09pm PDTApr 23, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

See Offers News Posted Yesterday at 4:00 AM Updated April 23 increase font size Is your digital life private? A lot depends on your provider President Trump's repeal of FCC rules for internet service providers means your data is – potentially – far less secure. By Colin WoodardStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6317 Share Comment Read Article Fletcher Kittredge is founder and CEO of GWI, a phone and internet service provider that serves more than 18,000 customers in Maine. He says the repeal of rules governing what ISPs can do with customer data – which President Trump signed into law this month – will undermine users' trust in the Web. Staff photo by Derek Davis When President Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress swept away privacy rules preventing your internet service providers from selling your data without your permission, you might think Fletcher Kittredge would want to celebrate. Kittredge, after all, is founder and CEO of Biddeford-based GWI, an internet service provider that serves more than 18,000 Maine customers and would benefit from the repeal, which lets companies like his sell his customer’s Web browsing history, geo-location movements, and all sorts of other valuable information to advertisers. The rules, repeal advocates said, had put more stringent restrictions on such firms than are applied to Web-based companies like Facebook or Google. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF Privacy experts say there are ways to make it harder for internet service providers and Web companies to snoop on your online activity. Use privacy-enchanced browsers – TOR, a free browser created by volunteers, makes it harder to track your movements on the internet. Opt out of being tracked – Most ISPs allow you to opt out of some of the ways they track your data and feed you ads. Virtual Private Network – A subscription service that creates an encrypted tunnel for your internet activity, but you have to trust your VPN not to snoop on you. Pick an ISP that doesn’t collect data – Some ISPs don’t, but you have to live in a town they happen to serve. Check their privacy policies. Related Headlines Is your data for sale? We asked local internet providers about their safeguards But Kittredge says the repeal is a disaster for his customers and anyone who cares about privacy or civil liberties, an ill-conceived move that will ultimately make people’s data less secure and the internet itself less valuable. “ISPs have broader access to information about you than anybody else because everything else goes on top of the connection they provide,” he says. “They can tell who you’re having conversations with, where you go, and lots of information that’s best left private, especially as hackers will be attracted to it. “If we all end up not being able to appropriately trust the internet, that’s not good for anyone.” The rule repeal – which the president signed into law April 3 – will make most things we do on the internet much less private, privacy experts say, as providers learn how to make money selling their customers’ data. For years prior to the repeal, providers had been expecting tightened rules and had set their policies to anticipate this, but now are free to exploit data more aggressively. This has implications for Maine internet users and national policymakers alike. Proponents of the repeal said it was necessary to create an even playing field between internet service providers and other Web-based companies, but the practical effect so far has been to shift the balance in favor of service providers, who can now operate with far fewer privacy restrictions. “There are no rules here now,” says lawyer Peter Guffin, who heads Pierce Atwood’s privacy and data security practice and teaches information privacy law at the University of Maine School of Law. “There’s a complete vacuum in terms of when an ISP can see into the contents of our communications, what it can do with those contents, and even whether it has to tell us if this data has been hacked. “From a user’s perspective, you should be on notice that the ISPs have been given the green light by the U.S. government to essentially surveil all of your electronic communications,” Guffin added. “My hunch is that many providers are rewriting their privacy notices, and whatever they said about opting out won’t be the same as a year ago.” Internet providers can see a wide range of their customers’ online activity, according to Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the San Francisco-based digital civil liberties group. Unless you’re using special tools like a virtual private network or the free, privacy-minded Tor internet browser, he says, “an ISP could definitely see and sell all the web addresses you visit,” though they would be limited to the domain name for “https” sites using encryption, such as banks, most online shopping sites, Google, Facebook, and Web mail. They can also gather your geo-location data – especially interesting for mobile internet – and could glean what songs you’ve been listening to, movies you’ve watched, or items you’ve shopped for from any unencrypted addresses you’ve visited. While they can also see the content of emails in accounts they provide their users, wiretapping laws likely prevent them from sharing or selling this information. Reducing exposure to snooping There are steps Mainers can take to reduce their exposure, says Zachary Heiden, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. One is to use the Tor browser (download the Tor browser here) – though it will slow down your internet traffic – and encrypted text messaging tools like Signal (download Signal here). “That will at least protect the content of your communications,” he says. “But it doesn’t protect the metadata” – the digital equivalent of a letter’s envelope, with sender, receiver, time stamp, and size information about the text. Users can also ask their ISPs to opt them out of at least some of their data being shared, though this process is often cumbersome. “An ACLU colleague of mine who is an expert on internet privacy tried as an exercise to contact different ISPs and exercise the opt-out option and found it incredibly challenging and confusing – and this is somebody who studies technology for a living,” he says. “But if you care about privacy and don’t want your personal browsing history stored, commodified, and sold then it may be worth it for you to take those steps to opt out.” More sophisticated users may consider subscribing to a virtual private networking – or VPN – service, which masks much of one’s internet activity from your service provider, but experts say that comes with its own risks, as the VPN provider may be snooping on you itself. “There’s a strong overlap between VPN companies and the dark web, because a lot of people who want to hide things this way are also doing something wrong,” says Kittredge. “It can be like hiring a security guard to protect your warehouse by going to the local bar and picking out somebody who looks tough.” A fourth possibility, depending on your geographic location: “Vote with your wallets and choose ISPs that are protective of your privacy,” Heiden says. Most ISPs active in Maine are seeking to reassure customers about their commitment to their privacy, but on closer scrutiny, the strength of their stated commitments varies considerably. Another unknown is what lawmakers will do next. Repeal’s goal: An ‘even playing field’ Congress repealed the privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission was about to put into effect that would have prohibited internet providers from selling or sharing a wide range of personal data without users’ consent, including Web browsing history, geo-location, and application usage. It was a party-line vote, with Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Bruce Poliquin voting with their Republican colleagues for repeal, independent Sen. Angus King, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and the entire Democratic caucus voting against. The action also prevents the FCC – the only entity currently authorized to regulate ISPs – from developing new rules. Supporters of repeal say it was necessary to create an even playing field between ISPs and other internet firms like Google and Facebook. The FCC rules on internet providers were stricter than those for Web-based firms and application developers, which are regulated by a different agency, the Federal Trade Commission. Opponents reject this as a false comparison. Poliquin says that repealing the rule will enhance privacy. “I absolutely want to ensure there are proper safeguards to keep Mainers’ private data secure when they use the Internet, which is why I voted with Senator Collins to remove this FCC rule,” he said in a written statement to the Maine Sunday Telegram. “The reality is that the FCC rule creates a misleading sense of security for users” because they applied “to only a specific segment of the industry, while giving unequal advantage and preference to a handful of companies that wouldn’t be under their jurisdiction. This is not the way to regulate, as it would also undermine the very goal of protecting users’ data.” His vote, he added, was “the right thing to do.” According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, internet firms have not been important campaign donors to either Collins or Poliquin. No member of the industry appears in the top 20 donors to either’s campaign or the political action committees they control. Users don’t pay Google, Facebook The most prominent lobbyist pushing for the changes is Jon Leibowitz, who was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission under President Obama, and now co-chairman of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, which represents Comcast, Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum), Verizon, DirecTV and other major internet providers who disliked the restrictions. In interviews with the Telegram, Leibowitz defended the rule change on fairness grounds. “The whole history of American privacy protection is focused on three things: the data itself, the way in which it’s collected, and the way in which it’s used,” he said. “You shouldn’t discriminate on the basis of silos, on the basis of who is doing the collecting.” ISPs, he and other proponents of the repeal argue, should be on an even playing field with other internet firms in terms of exploiting users’ digital data. But repeatedly asked why internet service providers should necessarily operate under the same rules as Web companies, he was unable to provide a clear answer. “It’s not about who is collecting your data, it’s about what data is being collected and how it is being used,” he reiterated, adding that he thought you could make a fair “apples to apples” comparison between ISPs and other internet firms. Elsewhere he has argued that ISPs don’t really have a comprehensive picture of our internet use, both because they can’t see the content of browsing at “https” sites and because customers roam from ISP to ISP during the day, connecting at work or the local coffee shop. Opponents of the rule change disagree, arguing there is a fundamental difference between the companies we pay to provide us internet access and those like Google and Facebook that are paid by advertisers for information about who we are and what products we might like. For internet service providers, they say, their users are their customers, while for Google and Facebook their users are the product they’re selling to their real customers, marketers and advertisers. “It’s a little disingenuous for ISPs to argue they should be treated equally, because it’s not really comparing apples to apples,” Pierce Atwood’s Guffin says. “Unlike using Google, which is free, I’m actually paying my ISP 50 bucks a month to get that ISP connection, and now I find out all my data is also being monetized and leveraged to make more money.” ISPs, he says, are more akin to the postal service – a conduit through which we conduct our digital lives, and one you can’t avoid having, which is why European regulations prohibit such firms from collecting user data. Nor do most Maine consumers have a lot of options, as many communities are served by just one or two providers. “It’s an essential service, and there aren’t hundreds of ISPs that are knocking at my door for business,” he adds. Heiden at the ACLU of Maine agrees. “The rules should be different, because ISPs are literally invited into our home and provide a service that is almost necessary for participating in the public and economic life of our country,” he says. “That carries with it a social responsibility that’s different than that of the Web companies we may choose to visit through the internet.” It’s unclear how or when privacy rules will be replaced In the short term, the repeal has also created a profoundly uneven playing field, as ISPs are now far less regulated than other firms. It is unclear how and when Congress will move to rectify the situation, given that the FCC still has authority over the ISPs yet is barred from developing privacy regulations. Some backers of the repeal appear concerned about the vacuum. On April 7, 50 Republican House members wrote the FCC chairman to urge him “to continue to hold ISPs to their privacy promises” laid out in the privacy policies they present their users. The letter also suggested the FCC should turn regulation of ISPs over to the FTC. (Poliquin was not a signatory.) But Gillula of the Electronic Frontier Foundation says that’s not reassuring, as many major ISPs’ privacy policies allow them to collect your browsing history and target ads at you unless you opt out, something most users are unaware they can do. “Basically, the letter is kind of like asking the FCC to ensure that the fox guarding the henhouse stands by the contract he imposed on the hens, which says in fine print that he’s allowed to eat one or two of them now and then,” he says. It’s also possible that the Maine Legislature could try to impose its own rules, though this might be tested in court. “This is all uncharted waters,” says Guffin. “But if you have Congress saying we’re not regulating ISPs, it may create an opening for states to step in.” Colin Woodard can be contacted at: [email protected] Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Home sweet Home? By Oliver Cragg April 23, 2017 09:00 BST Google Home launched in the UK on 6 April costing £129.IBTimes UK After months of envious glances at Google Home owners across the pond, the Google Assistant-powered smart speaker has finally made its way to the UK. The Alphabet company's brainy boombox becomes the first real challenger to Amazon's excellent Echo range, as well as the shopping giant's early monopoly over the nascent smart speaker market. We already know that Google's Alexa-rivaling AI has a few tricks up its sleeve thanks to its grand debut on Pixel smartphones in 2016, but does it have enough surprises left to out-muscle its competitor and make Home the all-singing, all-dancing smart home hub of choice? Let's find out. Made in Sweden? Google has a history of crafting consumer products that teeter perilously close to the land of bland. Whether it's the Pixel smartphone's unfussy metal and glass combo or Daydream View's pyjama-like fabric finish, Google appears to be wholly committed to a part-art deco, part-science fiction aesthetic. Google Home largely fits this mould and is all the better for it. Reportedly inspired by (profoundly middle-class) household staples like candles and wine glasses, Home is exactly the kind of device you would expect to see relaxing alongside a copy of GQ on an Ikea coffee table. Aside from two tiny microphone holes on its sloped top, a mute button and a "G" logo on the back, Home's delicately chubby, inconspicuous design ensures it blends into the background of almost any room. It's a definite plus point for a device that is intended as a formless assistant. One quick "OK Google" later and Home becomes more of an active presence, however, summoning a ring of glowing dots in muted, oh so Google-esque hues to its slanted top. Touching the twirling light show also presents the unit's volume and playback controls through intuitive taps and circular swipes. It's worth noting that you can buy swappable speaker grills in brighter shades, but the default grey fits nicely with the white upper half as standard. An Assistant... By Google Home marks Google Assistant's graduation from a handy smartphone companion to both a smart home dictator and an omnipresent media butler, serving up music, video content, weather and news reports with short, simple commands. Yet at the time of review, Assistant still seems to have a lot of studying to do and often vocally admits so if you ask it a question or bellow a command it doesn't quite understand: "I don't know how to help with that yet, but I'm still learning." The most glaring omission at launch is multi-user support. While anyone can natter along with Mrs. Assistant, every calendar appointment or playlist request is tied to a single user. Thankfully Google has confirmed a change is on the way to the UK in the near future, but support for both a work and personal account for a single user is still absent. While it'd be a tad churlish to criticise Assistant for the comparatively small third-party developer support when compared to Alexa's many "Skills" – dubbed "Actions" in Google's ecosystem – it's bizarre that several of Google's own apps are completely incompatible with Home. "OK, Google. Do I have any new emails?" "I don't know how to help with that yet, but I'm still learning." Google Home's speaker grill can be swapped out for optional colourways.Google That being said, the foundations are in place for Assistant to eventually surpass Alexa, Cortana, Siri and any other AI-powered digital assistant thanks to its secret weapon: It's made by Google. The ineffable mass of search data simmering underneath Assistant's algorithms is its greatest strength by far. Ask it to translate, convert, spell or measure almost anything you can think of and it has a solid answer more often than not, utilising Google's clever "Answer Box" system on the main search engine site. Setting alarms, checking the football scores, ordering an Uber and other everyday tasks are equally seamless, while a bucket-load of quirky Easter eggs are funny enough to be worthy of showing off to visiting friends and family - it can beatbox better than Siri for a start. For the most part, Assistant has just enough smarts to match its style, but there are several stand-out functions that truly surpass expectation. Casting off into fresh waters Aurally speaking, Home isn't the finest audio experience available, but we've heard much worse from otherwise 'dumb' speakers retailing above Home's modest asking price of £129. Considering its relatively small stature it's surprising how well it makes legit banger... bang. Unlike 99% of speakers currently on the market, Google Home does not support Bluetooth connectivity, instead relying on Google Cast. The enormous downside to this is that popular apps that have shunned Cast compatibility are a no-go when it comes to Home – most notably anything by Apple, Amazon or Sky for UK buyers. When it comes to music, Home instead relies on Google Play Music and – crucially for most – Spotify at launch. It's here that the Cast ecosystem really kicks into gear and Home becomes a media-hungry angel. Whisper a track, artist or album name at Home and it gets the party started in seconds. It even passed IBTimes UK's now mandatory 'Wu-Tang Test', thumping out a choice track from '36 Chambers' on Spotify with a single voice command. Have a Chromecast already? Ask Home to play a left-field YouTube series on your TV and bunker down on the sofa for a few hours of Dragon Ball Z Abridged. Netflix support is sorely missing at launch in the UK, but with US buyers already enhancing their binge watching habits we can't imagine it is too far off. Home sweet Home? After the inevitable flurry of back-and-forth chats, afternoon boogies and inane questioning that comes with owning a Google Home, it delicately settles into your daily routine, but it's also at this point where reality kicks in. As with any member of the smart speaker wave, Google Home's long-term usefulness isn't solely based on its "Google" features. New Actions will come flooding in through updates and the Home smartphone app will eventually list far more compatible media apps over time, but the other half – the truly smart half – requires a much larger commitment. If you already have Philips Hue lights, Nest thermostats or any number of IoT devices with IFTTT support, then Google Home is a suitably smart hub to match, but without a network of connected things, it will find itself sat in the centre of an otherwise oblivious home. In short, if Home is indeed the future, your home might need to take a few steps out of the past. Our verdict Google Home Bolstered by a sub-Echo price tag and its creator's seemingly infinite data pool, Google Home has made a strong debut in the burgeoning smart speaker market. Impersonal moniker aside, Home's baked-in Google Assistant tech provides a fun and friendly voice to counter its pleasingly nonchalant looks and has the potential to do more for the rise of voice assistants than Siri – and possibly even Alexa – has done so far. While you'll need a truly smart home to take advantage of Home's full capabilities, media-lovers will quickly develop a soft spot for its audiovisual repertoire. Combine that with a feature list that we are genuinely excited to watch grow in the future and we're left with only one thing to say: "OK Google, welcome home."

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 23, 2017 1:22 pm Microsoft’s Windows 10 Cloud will be competing with Google’s Chrome OS. Microsoft is holding an event in New York on May 2, and it’s widely expected to unveil Windows 10 Cloud. Although the company has not confirmed what it will be announcing, a leaked document obtained by Windows Central seems to confirm the minimum hardware specifications for Microsoft’s Windows 10 Cloud-based laptop. A leaked slide details that a basic system needs a quad-core processor (Celeron or better), 4GB RAM, 32GB storage (64GB for 64-bit), fast eMMC or SSD storage and a battery larger than 40 watt-hours. The publication compares battery life and other performance benchmarks against Google’s Chromebooks. The document also notes Chromebooks are faster to boot (10 seconds), whereas Windows machines takes 15 to 5 seconds to boot. Also read: Microsoft to hold event on May 2, likely to focus on Windows 10 Cloud Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Microsoft is planning reveal a Chromebook competitor. Microsoft’s invite itself confirms that event will be an education-focused. According to reports, the event is internally code-named ‘Bespin’ the Star Wars planet that hosts Cloud city. The Cloud-based operating system will likely to compete with Google’s Chrome OS in the education market, where the latter OS has the lead over Microsoft’s Windows OS. ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley reports that Windows Cloud 10 will be a strip-down version of Windows 10. The platform will only run Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Windows store. Foley claims that Windows 10 Cloud will be similar to Windows RT, which was a mobile OS that was announced in 2011. Many people are expecting a new hardware to be announced alongside Windows 10 Cloud.  According to recent claims, the device is dubbed as the ‘Windows 10 Cloudbook’ and will be a low-cost machine. At this point, Microsoft isn’t telling anything about the upcoming Windows 10 Cloud. If the company is indeed making a Chromebook competitor, we will know all the details on May 2. The event will be live-streamed on Microsoft’s website.

If they ever get the bugs out, autonomous cars will put a lot of human drivers out of work. By Steven Greenhouse / The American Prospect April 23, 2017 Print Comments automobile congestion in the morning rush hour Photo Credit: chuyuss/Shutterstock Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school. LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.” FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene. TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.” NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

Google is often associated with the famous search browser and while this might be true, Google’s reach extends so much more than that. Google is the company that develops the most popular mobile operating system, Android. In addition, the Android parent also has launched a handful of premium smartphones along the years. With that being said, it’s pretty clear why Android fans are so loyal. They can get everything they need just from one company. Nexus Brand As previously mentioned, Google has launched many smartphones during the past few years. The Android parent used to collaborate with different tech manufacturers such as Motorola, LG and Huawei just to name a few, and created Nexus smartphones. However, the Nexus era has ended because Google has decided to pursue its own path in the smartphone industry. What Makes Nexus 6P so Special? Usually when a company leaves behind an entire brand, the products under that brand stop selling. Well this isn’t the case with Nexus 6P. The latter is recognized as being one of the most popular Android smartphones ever made and it doesn’t look like Google is going to stop providing software support to it anytime soon. Many might be wondering what makes Nexus 6P so special, but the answer is quite simple. The smartphone offers impressive performances for an affordable price. In addition, Nexus 6P will also provide its owners with a pure Android experience. Notable Nexus 6P Specs The reason why Nexus 6P is still more than capable of being as a daily driver is because its powered by Qualcomm’s octa-core Snapdragon 810 CPU. The processor runs at a speed of 2.0GHz Cortex-A57 and it is paired with an Adreno 430 graphics processing unit and 3GB of RAM. Leaving the hardware internals aside, Nexus 6P ships with a 5.7 inch AMOLED display. The panel offers a high pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560 and a large pixel density of 518 ppi. We should also mention that Google has made sure to coat the smartphone’s display in Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and oleophobic coating.

Five years have passed since Google has updated its Nexus 7 offering and Android fans who are looking to purchase tablets, are practically forced to acquire them from Google’s competition. The Android parent was actually expected to introduce the highly anticipated Nexus 7 (2017) during last year, but some manufacturing issues came up. Huawei Fallout As many might already know, Google has teamed up with a bunch of tech companies along the years in order to create Nexus devices. In fact, the original Nexus 7 was created in collaboration with Asus. Huawei is the last tech manufacturer that Google has teamed with, and Huawei was supposedly going to produce Nexus 7 (2017). Sadly, things didn’t go according to plan since Huawei parted ways with Google. The reason why these two tech giants decided to break off their ties is because Google didn’t want Huawei to put its branding on the devices the two create together. Huawei is still a young name in the tech market in comparison with the likes of Samsung, and considering that it still looking to make a name for itself, the Chinese manufacturer decided to pursue its own path in the tech world. New Manufacturer Fortunately for Android fans, Huawei and Google’s fallout doesn’t mean that Nexus 7 (2017) will not come out anymore. Rumor has it that Google is in talks with HTC right now. This rumor is highly likely to be proven true since this wouldn’t be the first time these two companies team up. In fact, HTC is the tech manufacturer that produces Google’s latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Nexus 7 (2017) Google’s upcoming tablet is going to give Android fans what they want, and by that we mean a pure Android experience. Even better, Nexus 7 (2017) is expected to ship with Android 8.0 Nougat out of the box. This is actually what leads us to believe that Nexus 7 (2017) will be launched towards the end of the year, when the final version of Android 8.0 is scheduled to come out as well.

As many might already know, Google has collaborated with different tech manufacturers in the past in order to create Nexus devices. While all of Google’s Nexus devices are considered as premium products, it seems like the ones produced in collaboration with LG have been equipped with a flawed design. In fact, LG is being faced against a class-action lawsuit because Nexus 5X, G4, G5, V10 and V10 have been equipped with malfunctioning hardware which sends the smartphones into a bootloop mode. LG Bootloop Lawsuit A US based law firm has put in motion a lawsuit against LG because it’s malfunctioning hardware is making the affected aforementioned smartphones to be practically useless. Google’s Nexus 5X is also included in the list of affected smartphones and LG will have to come out with a solution. LG is expected to take responsibility over this issue and repair or replace affected smartphones once the class action lawsuit ends. Nexus 6P Lawsuit Even though Nexus 6P has not been produced by LG, it’s still being affected by the dreaded bootloop mode. Huawei and Google are also going to have to deal with the US based law firm that’s suing LG. Neither Google nor Huawei has taken responsibility for Nexus 6P’s issue, and owners of affected Nexus 6P devices are left with virtually useless phones. Bootloop Defect The hardware malfunction that’s causing Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P devices to become paper weights has been called the bootloop defect. What basically happens is that the smartphone randomly powers off even though it might over 60 percent of battery charge. The smartphone will not power on again and the only solution that smartphone owners have is to send the affected device to a repair shop, at their own expense. LG is believed to have placed the processor in a wrong position on the motherboard. The reason why LG’s hardware design matters is because the processor quickly overheats and it automatically shuts down. Therefore, LG has to relocate the CPU, or just find a better cooling system.

Google Nexus 5 – Who Said Smartphones have an Expiration Date?

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Android fans are known for always being very loyal. There are two main reasons behind this statement. First off, Google is providing them with smartphones that do not have an expiration date such as Nexus 5 and with a stable stream of updates. However, the aforementioned smartphone has actually stopped receiving support from Google because it has reached its three years milestone, but this isn’t stopping Android fans from still using it as a daily driver. Operating System Updates As previously mentioned, Nexus 5 has stopped being eligible to receive any of Google’s upcoming software updates. This shouldn’t be a surprise to no one since Google’s policy states that once a device reaches the two year milestone, Google is not forced to keep on updating it anymore. The best thing about Android powered smartphones though is the fact that they can receive updates from other sources, and not just from Google. For example, Nexus 5 is still being kept alive by custom ROM developers such as CyanogenMod, LineageOS and so on. Notable Hardware Specs While custom ROM developers might be the ones who are keeping Nexus 5 alive, the smartphone’s hardware specs are what make it a viable daily driver despite its age. The smartphone ships with a sleek looking 4.95 inch True HD IPS+ display that offers a full HD pixel resolution (1080 x 1920) and a pixel density of 445. To make things even better, the display has been coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Leaving the display aside, hardware power is what really matters. With that being said, let’s take a look under Nexus 5’s hood and see what it has to offer. First off, Nexus 5 is powered by Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU. The processor runs at a boosted speed of 2.3GHz Krait 400 and it is paired with an Adreno 330 graphics processing unit and 2GB RAM. We think it’s safe to say that Nexus 5 is more than capable of offering stable performances despite its age. However, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t any better smartphones on the market. We cannot stop ourselves from wondering when will Nexus 5’s popularity end.

Quickly fix PC issues and prevent others from happening with this software: Download ReimagePlus (100% safe download and endorsed by us). Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. We think it’s safe to say that Nexus 7 (2017) is the most anticipated tech device of this year. The original model of Nexus 7 first came out in 2012, but now Android fans should be getting ready for a revamp. In fact, Google’s upcoming tablet was expected to ship somewhere around 2016 but things didn’t go according to Google’s plan, and the tablet’s release date was rescheduled. The Android parent has yet to confirm that Nexus 7 (2017) is on its way, but this isn’t stopping Android fans from sparking up rumors. We have rounded up the most likely to happen rumors and we’re going to present them right now. This way, Android fans will get an idea of what they need to know about Nexus 7 (2017) in order to be ready for it. Brand Name Even though Google’s not-yet release tablet is being regarded as Nexus 7 (2017), many believe that its actually going to be branded under the Pixel name. This is actually highly plausible since Google hasn’t been hiding the fact that it’s looking to get rid of the Nexus brand. This leaves Nexus 7 (2017) to arrive under the Pixel 7 name. However, the brand name doesn’t change the fact that Nexus 7 (2017) is going to be the most powerful Android tablet ever made. Operating System Nexus 7 (2017) is definitely going to make record sales because it offers a pure Android experience. With that being said, it’s pretty clear that Nexus 7 (2017) will ship with Google’s latest operating system and that is Android 8.0. The only downside to Android 8.0 is that it’s still in the developer preview phase. Therefore, we’re going to have to wait a while until the public version comes out. Release Date The most important question that Android fans must be asking themselves right now has to be about the device’s release date. As previously mentioned, Google doesn’t want to disclose any vital information about Nexus 7 (2017) thus we cannot know for sure when it will come out. However, according to rumors Nexus 7 (2017) is scheduled for an October release.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! Pat Bushey On April 3, President Trump signed a joint congressional resolution that repealed the Federal Communications Commission’s privacy rules. The debate prompted an unusual amount of misleading sturm und drang. Understanding what’s really at stake requires a deeper exploration of this issue to dispel myths and recognize realities. There is a common misconception that Congress stripped Americans of their privacy rights. In reality, consumers have the same rights today that they did before the vote. The joint resolution repealed an FCC order that was not scheduled to take effect until later this year. By repealing these rules, Congress preserved the status quo and consumers should see no difference because the law today is the same as it has been since at least 2015. × Advertisement The purpose of repeal is to restore a level playing field among digital advertisers. Internet-based companies such as Google and Facebook are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulation, which requires companies to notify consumers regarding what information is collected and how it is used, and to allow them to “opt out” of such collection efforts. These rules also governed broadband providers until 2015, when the FCC inadvertently stripped the FTC of jurisdiction when it reclassified them as common carriers. The FCC could have corrected this error by simply applying the FTC rules to broadband providers. But it instead applied a stricter opt-in rule, which prohibited broadband providers from using consumer data unless the consumer gives explicit permission. Importantly, under both regimes, consumers ultimately control how their data is used. The only difference is the default rule: the FTC allows Google to use your data unless you say no, while the FCC would have allowed Verizon to use your data only if you say yes. This is a trivial distinction for consumers — but it would have given Google a tremendous advantage in the battle for internet advertising dollars, a market Google already dominates. Additionally, it is a common misunderstanding that broadband providers know more about you than companies like Google or Facebook. Broadband providers can’t really “see” all traffic — they can only gather information on one’s activities at home, while Google can capture data anywhere a person is logged into a Google account or using a Google operating system. And Google and Facebook, which collect an estimated two of every three digital advertising dollars, can capture content, while broadband providers generally can only see metadata and traffic flow information. Consumers uncomfortable with the monetization of their information still have options. All major broadband providers have privacy policies that allow consumers to opt out of data collection. Consumers can also use a virtual private network to shield their activities online, though be aware that the most reliable VPN providers are not free. Ultimately, privacy questions cannot be debated in a vacuum. Consumer information is the lifeblood of the internet. Our information is routinely collected by many companies, but this is not necessarily problematic. Monetization of consumer data is what helps make Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, and other services free — and might someday bring broadband prices down. We cannot debate the value of potential future privacy rules without considering the consequences such rules might have on the broader Internet ecosystem. Daniel Lyons is a visiting fellow at American Enterprise Institute’s Center for Internet, Communications and Technology Policy, and is an associate professor at Boston College Law School. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.

YouTube Is Testing A New Material UI On The Web Jacob Long Follow View All Posts 2016/04/30 8:23pm PDTApr 30, 2016 163 Plus 1 on G+ 209 Share on Facebook 4 Share on Twitter Total Shares376 Google News Google apparently has a Material Design UI overhaul in the works for YouTube and it looks pretty good. While it has not yet been pushed to the masses, it is apparently being tested on a small group of users while the developers look for bugs and Google braces for any negative feedback (people hate change, remember). Here's a look at the goods and a way to enable the new UI for yourself. First, let's look at the homepage. Here's the current version: And the new: Not exactly a radical difference, but you do see the modern search bar that should be familiar from Google's Android apps and several web services as well. The "upload" word button has been swapped with an icon equivalent, again in line with the mobile design. The slide-out menu is more noticeably redesigned, though. First, here's the current version: And the new: Here we see some of that signature white space common to Material Design. The rounding of the icons is a small change but definitely feels like an improvement. Channel pages provide a starker contrast. Here's the current look, not so much different from the homepage: And the new: Taking another page out of the Material Design playbook, you see the top matter taking on a distinct color associated with the channel. This really gives you the sense that you're not on just another YouTube page, but this channel's YouTube page. Some buttons have been given more depth, while several elements—like the profile photo and horizontal browsing button—have been made round. Of course, many of us spend almost all of our YouTube time on the video player, not the browsing-oriented pages. Just to refresh, here's how that looks now: Maybe it's unsurprising that this is where the changes stand out least, then: The edges of the different elements of the page are less clear because the space between them no longer is shaded gray. It's a cleaner look and probably doesn't confuse anyone about what is what. It's also smarter in general to leave the player page alone so as not to surprise casual web browsers. Want to try it out for yourself? Here are some instructions if you're using Chrome, thanks to Redditor giorgiomarinel: 1) go to https:www.youtube.com/?gl=US 2) open the developer tools (ctrl + shift + i) 3) go to the `Resources´ tab and delete the VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE cookie for the youtube domain 4) go to the console and define the VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE cookie using the following command: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=Qa1hUZu3gtk;path=/;domain=.youtube.com";
 5) reload the page You can also reuse your VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE cookie. Note that setting your region to US/worldwide seems to be necessary for it to work. The redesign may not be available on other browsers, either. Tags design material design ui youtube youtube ui youtube web youtube web ui subscribe ... Previous Story [Bonus Round] Aliens Vs.

Ink for Google extension does the same thing. Total Security Did you get it to work?? William No, I didnt, I haven't tried it, because the extension works exactly the same. Total Security Which Google extension?? William Ink for Google q Which extension? Đức Thành I might be wrong, but I think it could likely be Ink for Google. Don't take my word for it though AsterMK But what about the extension's name? Nicholas Matranga Yes. I'm still not sure what it's called blitz4075 Ink for Google ToasTd What's it called? Orkeren1307 It's called "Ink for Google".... Tomfoolery Extension Google which? Badouken Weird I cant seem to get it to work following those steps above. Looks freaking sweet though. Edit: Nevermind signed out and it worked. Its beeeeaautiful! Total Security I think there is some important info missing. I did not get it to run yet :( Orkeren1307 you have to be signed out Total Security IT WORKS. BUT A BIG BUMMER: you need to be signed out of your account... Badouken Yup noticed that as well, sad times... :( but hopefully it rolls out soon! Probably going to be an I/O announcement. Total Security 2016 will still become an awesome year through changes like these :P Paul_Werner Oh thanks for mentioning this. I thought I missed a step or something too. Makes sense when the thing you are defining says "Visitor" Brandon Giesing Nah that cookie is just used for A/B test experiments on YouTube in general. Most tests that you can change that cookie to get work for both logged in or not logged in users. One example was the new Player last year (or was it the year before last by now) used the same cookie trick Richard Branches You seem to like britney a lot... Victor Souza can somebody please explain the 4th one a little more detailed? z0phi3l Looks good IMO But then again, I'm a true tech aficionado and don't fear change Đức Thành I usually hate changes but I think these look nice sbeaulieu You need to be SIGNED OUT of your google account after/before doing these steps.. Total Security And the moment you sign in it's away again :( cryptochrome Confirmed. Only works when signed out. Signing back in gets you back to the old design, despite having the right cookie. Roderick Gadellaa Thanks you just saved me from trying this for half an hour. After having spent 5 minutes XD Nicholas Matranga Seems like you have to sign out to see the new design using the steps Claian It changes the icon in the browser tab as well, its a darker red with a 3d effect ToasTd I wish they'd make up their mind as to whether they want a flat UI or not. Raijin Better be a placeholder... Henri Ollik That's actually the old favicon. Probably an oversight. Channel 2012 I guess at least something positive will come of this awful update. aditya sharma yt overhaul :O nyc philnolan3d I use YouTube every day (and post weekly) but I've never seen a side menu that looks the new or the old ones shown here. Miles Reiter It looks like this if you're logged in. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4163553/ShareX/2016/05/chrome_2016-05-01_00-42-29.png Nicholas Matranga If only google search looked like this... AbbyZFresh Never gonna happen. Google search was designed from the beginning to be simple and to the point. q What? Ugly and filled with usless crap? Variousthings3251 Check out this concept video (it is not mine) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk0dNS1hYMc Jorge Jimenez I had forgotten how much of a dump YouTube was until I signed out. The HORROR, seeing "TOP VINE", "Top ... by Mathew Santoro", and other junk like iPhone destruction videos was just to much. Besides that, the new material looks great. person They've overhauled their recommendation engine. If you use it, I've found the suggestions to be pretty great. Brandon Giesing The top vines thing is annoying as it's basically stealing views from the Vines themselves. Also why does everybody hat Mathew Santoro? He's a good guy with high quality videos. If you don't like it that's fine but then just don't complain about it or watch it. João Victor Schiavo He is a hypocritical plagiarist. Ryan Johnson "If you don't like it that's fine but then just don't complain about it" And why can't we complain about content we dislike? Brandon Giesing Have you not heard the saying "If you don't have something nice to say, then don't say it"? I would also add "something nice to say OR constructive criticism to add". So I worded it a bit wrong but if all people are going to do is hate them without providing feedback about why they hate them, then they shouldn't make their hate public and just ignore them. It's like leaving a 1 star review on an app that says "it sucks". Developers can't fix it or do anything. Now if the review said instead "the apps lags my device from the amount of ads" and the developer didn't want to fix it, then you can express your hate. Same thing with his videos. You hate them but why and what could he do to improve? And if you just don't like the style, doesn't mean they are bad for everyone so just ignore them. Denigrate YouTube doesn't look bad for once. person Server switches on the web are the best thing as you can often force them with a cookie edit person That being said, I can't get this to work T_T hp-fourtwenty Turn the lights off, people...that white UI is god-awful!! Brandon Giesing When you enable Theater mode on a video, it shows up with a all-black header and video background Total Security Theater mode? Please go into more detail here : o Đức Thành Yeah this please Brandon Giesing The rectangle icon that's been next to the Full Screen button on the player for about 5 years now. Nick Coad If you can't deal with white you might need to turn your monitors brightness down. Google didn't invent white. Gerardo Sarabia But they chose it. ItsBritneyBitch A fellow Britney fan huh? ;) Brandon Giesing No, since the test doesn't allow the UI when logged in, it's just showing the trending videos which Britney was on that day. q Shit Britney Spears has fans? What year is this? 1999?q Tony Anyone else hate having to see Mr Clean's bald head everywhere? Wish we could block certain users from showing up in results/trending. Brandon Giesing He's there for a reason as he makes good videos. Some of his thumbs are weird but the content is good. person When using theater mode, the video is larger and the toolbar turns black. limhenry IT'S BUILT WITH POLYMER!!! (Polymer is a Web Components Library developed by Google) #BuiltWithPolymer mvilcis YAY FOR INEVITABLE FRAGMENTATION I might be wrong though. Connor I don't quite get your point here. Care to explain? makapav I think he just did to himself... mvilcis Yeah, sure, I worded that weirdly. 1) Material Design isn't new anymore, there might be a new design or new concepts in the work. 2) Not everything will get updated because users don't understand new stuff and don't like change (not us, the computer-illiterate ones) 3) If some apps do get updated, they'll look outdated later anyway. FRGuzman I think you are... AtomicBananaFruitHatMan I guess you're the type who speaks before he thinks. mvilcis No. Fatal1ty_93_RUS How the hell does a website design create fragmentation? João Victor Schiavo Fragmentation = Inconsistency Fatal1ty_93_RUS That's completely two different things João Victor Schiavo That's what he did mean. mvilcis I worded that weirdly. 1) Material Design isn't new anymore, there might be a new design or new concepts in the work. 2) Not everything will get updated because users don't understand new stuff and don't like change (not us, the computer-illiterate ones) 3) If some apps do get updated, they'll look outdated later anyway. Henri Ollik As is YouTube Gaming, I expected no less. M.e.Puente Why am I NEVER part of these "small test groups" you speak of :( Антон Курилов Don't work( aRvInD Highlight of 2016 after all those pink phones!!! Absolutely love it... senor_heisenberg Nice. Looks great. mkp So this is a reason why the main page in android YT app a couple days ago was f***ed up on my phone (without any app updates) and stay in this state to the present day... Suicide_Note I doubt it, since this article is referring to the web version of YouTube, and had nothing to do with the mobile interface. mkp Yes, I know what this article tells, but in my "point of view" (what I saw on tree completely different phones with the same "issue"), where the app on that day hasn't an update but the list of videos was changed in home page (huge thumbs, no categories, in general complete mess), have a correlation to the changes described in this art. In my opinion it looks like that both things (web and in-app mobile view) are somehow combined at the server-side. erptastic "This really gives you the sense that you're not on just another YouTube page, but this channel's YouTube page" Remember when you could truly customize your Channel page? Like change the widgets on there etc. Must have been at least 6 years ago now... mvilcis They really did strip away all the functionality starting from 2013. You know, when the "you only need a background image" wave started saf1927 Most channels had horrendous colour schemes and customisations back then. I prefer it now, at least if you put a bit of effort with the cover and branding, you can have an appealing channel without too much clutter. erptastic I always think more choice is good. Not the fault of YT if users change their channels and make them bad - good channels can invest a day of design to make their channels rock... Wis Looks MUCH better... #praiseduarte Ben I can't wait for the YouTube community to freak out when they do this.... AbbyZFresh And where will they go? Lol. Total Security I think he meant "freak out" in a positive way :P LitheBeep Nope. YT community gets furious over the slightest UI changes, this will probably kill them. saf1927 They always like to complain but get used to it quickly. When YouTube imposed Google+ profiles to comment on videos, no one bothered to check that you could basically great multiple channels with any name you wanted under the main Google account umbrella, which means "John Smith" could easily post as "Anon", "ThatDude" or whatever they wanted without having to reveal their name to the world. Most YouTube whiners aren't really the brightest tool in the shed. An Angry Chihuahua Upvoted for brightest tool in the shed. saf1927 Haha, well, brightest sounds nicer than sharpest! mattcoz Internet users in general get furious over the slightest UI changes. Same thing happens with Facebook, Twitter, etc. Total Security What?! No, I do think you overreact there. I believe that almost everybody will love the new design. But whatever :P LitheBeep Comment Copypastas and the YT subreddit speak for themselves Total Security True though. Nick Coad Have you been on the internet before? Total Security lel Art Ramirez When watching a video using the default size window, why can't I scroll the list of videos on the right without the whole page scrolling and covering the video that is playing? Is everyone's like that? Luca Now give us Google Calendar in material desing! mvilcis I don't know if I'd hate that or love it. The current layout is quite nice for what it is. It's compact and it does the job well. Maria Dude, just get Ink for Google, it's great. tobc Ink is good enough, but it makes the Google homepage crash quite often LitheBeep Never happened to me Maria Also never happened to me, maybe it's conflicting with some other extension you have. Morten Ulv You can turn it off on any site if it causes problems.

Picaso86 What is Ink? Pardon my ignorance. Picaso86 PS: I got it :) Brandon Giesing I love Ink EXCEPT that it horribly lags my machine on the new tab page. Without it enabled, I can open a new tab and go to a typed URL instantly. With it enabled, the new tab takes ~30 secs to load and after entering the URL, it just sits there with a loading indicator for ~1-4 minutes before even actually starting to load the page. It doesn't happen with Ink disabled and my only other addons are Pushbullet and LastPass (I have tried with any combination of the three enabled/disabled) Sean Krossing Once again, I've never experienced it, that's genuinely weird. Anyways, that sucks, but can't you just disable it for the new tab page specifically? You know, by clicking the extension icon, and then turning off "enable on this site". Brandon Giesing Yes but since the new tab page is actually a special Google.com page, that would also disable Ink on Google Search results (which i still want) Sean Krossing Doesn't do that for me, it only disables it on the new tab page. Sean Krossing Oh whatever, just understood what you mean, that sucks. matteventu This is the first time of all the story of YouTube that I'm happy with the new UI. This new material-like one looks great. While the current one is the crap of the crap. But I miss the old one with just the sidebar next to the video separated in two parts: related videos and more from the same channel. I goddamn miss it. Đức Thành I have always been mostly indifferent to changes in YouTube for the web, at times annoyed by the changes, some other times I liked some new elements but still saw everything as "meh", but this time I'm really loving that new design. I hope it rolls out to everyone soon. matteventu This is the first time of all the story of YouTube that I'm happy with the new UI. This new material-like one looks great.

Moose05 They finally filled up all that white space. Only took a decade. Bravo! AbbyZFresh I expect a whollllle lotta backlash. The app Material redesign was bad enough. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you think so? I don't have a problem with material. I also thought that on a whole people like the design. someone755 Great, now the Matthew Santoro, Sky News, Britney Spears, and Vine compilation videos have even bigger thumbnails and even more in my face. Just what I wanted. elgoog Apparently videos for 12 year olds which pass off as facts, news propaganda and terrible music is how google plans to make the world a better place by making sure you can't add an "adult" filter. Such is the world I guess. Đức Thành Those are probably not Google's preferences but recommendations based on the popularity of those videos. Which means it's what the majority of the general public likely prefer... I wouldn't blame Google for that, and I'm grateful enough that Google has relevant contents for me when I sign in. Captain McAwesome Really really liking this new design. It's the white version of Gaming YouTube, and I love the design of that gaming-specific YouTube spin-off. So welcome new design! Sotcho HD Hi mögt ihr SpongeBOZZ Đức Thành Very nice! jawsnnn The only thing I'll miss is the dislike bar. I know that it's akin to being spoon-fed, but a visual representation of people's hatred is somehow a quicker indication than a tally of numbers. Abdulrhman i need a dark theme Jsilvermist I've noticed this new redesign for a few weeks now whenever I open an incognito window. ConCal I want Google to go even more all in with material design. I just want to see it everywhere. Burak Çalık Just roll it out AsterMK Awesome. But I don't like how the subscriber count isn't real time and just shows "34K". Or maybe it shows that because AP has exactly 34000 subs? Marc I wish they would offer a easier way to organise videos.... Deeco Only works when signed out, what's the point? Berkay When are we getting Gmail in material design? :P Ryderr3 Inbox Berkay Screw that, what's the point of Inbox if we already have Gmail? Ryderr3 Material Design? Berkay So you're telling me they're too lazy to use material design with Gmail? bananakabob Because Gmail is used by billions of people and they're not stupid enough to drastically change the look when something like Inbox exists. Berkay By that logic, they shouldn't change the look of YouTube either. TheSpaceUnicorn He said drastically change, this YouTube redesign isn't a drastic change. godutch I stopped using inbox because it was material design I hate it on android but I hate it on websites even more Nick Coad The point of Inbox is it's basically Gmail with a material design, which is what you asked for... Madis Otenurm Big fan of Material Design, but that title/description/comments whitespace is huge. xdapao3 It's crazy how with all these redesigns on both the app and the web they are still keeping the weird "share" icon... :D But more seriously, I HATE that on both the web and the app, we don't have like/dislike buttons when in full screen! bananakabob Yay for shitty, terrible "designs". Youtube continues the streak. Jfc, just fire the moron who came up with the abortion called "material design". saf1927 Yay for shitty, terrible "comments". Internet users continue the streak. Jfc, just ban the moron who came up with the abortion called "I don't like it, no one likes it". /s TechGuy22 Oh God. Another UI changes mattcoz In Firefox I get the new looking search box, and the new upload button, but everything else seems to be the same.

Morgan Freeman "The edges of the different elements of the page are less clear because the space between them no longer is shaded gray. It's a cleaner look and probably doesn't confuse anyone about what is what." Translation: the designer was clearly high and you can't tell where one part of the page ends and another starts anymore, but it's okay because white = clean and I love everything Google does! Besides, it's not like users care about borders. Please tell me Google at least paid you to write this, 'cause you're coming off as a moron and at least then you'd have an excuse for it. Variousthings3251 No!!! The material design is ugly as hell! I left Android and went to iOS, but I still need YouTube!! I even call the current design "Youtube Classic" because they left it for over 3 years. The new design looks ugly as hell...at least there needs to be an option to change the design for those who don't like it. They should ONLY change it on m.youtube.com (Youtube mobile site).

Google Pixel review: A very good phone by Google David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/10/18 6:11am PDTOct 18, 2016 188 Plus 1 on G+ 675 Share on Facebook 205 Share on Twitter Total Shares1068 Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Videos Update 1: 2016/10/28 12:30pm PDT For more thoughts from me after using the Pixel for over two weeks, check out this "review update" post.

They're Google's attempt to define itself as a hardware manufacturer worthy of comparison not just to Apple's iPhone, but the very products its Android operating system has allowed to flourish over the past eight years. Or, as the refrain goes: Google is finally going to compete with other smartphone manufacturers. This narrative can get in the way of discussing the Pixel for what it is (a smartphone), so I'll try to avoid confusing what this phone means to Google as a company and what it means to you as a consumer. I've been using the Pixel XL for five days. I specify this because as this review goes live, so will dozens of others. Almost all of these people have been using the phone for more or less the same amount of time, and the vast majority of impressions you read from blogs and news outlets today will be based upon five or fewer days with the phones. I am going to keep thoughts on certain items - battery life and general performance, for example - a bit more concise because of this. It's hard to know confidently just how good the battery life is for me yet. It's also hard to know how much the phone will slow down over time. So I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that this review is the end-all, be-all of our thoughts on the Pixel phones, nor to suggest that our impressions are definitive and supported by the week or two we typically afford to the review process. Thoughts are still evolving. That said, we did want to provide this review at the time Google allowed us to publish it, and I hope that this disclaimer gives you some transparency into that whole process. With the pleasantries and meta-discussion out of the way, let's get to what you're actually here for: the phones. Are they good? Great? The greatest? Has Google whipped up a smartphone that transcends a mere list of specifications and a software version? Well, no phone really, truly does, and setting the bar quite so high is to prime yourself for disappointment. But the Google Pixel is a great smartphone - I am convinced. Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us to believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. The processor, while it is the best part Qualcomm has on offer, isn't really much better than the existing Snapdragon 820. Motorola builds phones that charge more quickly, Samsung makes phones with more features and better components, Xiaomi's phones offer far more value for money, and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment. What does the Pixel offer that is so special? Well, some of you will want to see me hang for this line, but: it just works. Need to switch to a new carrier? That's not a problem - the Pixel supports all four US providers, plus Project Fi. Take a lot of photos? Google will store all of them in the cloud at full resolution, for free (and the Pixel will automatically delete old photos when on-device storage nears capacity). There's no bloatware. Live remote support is built into the phone. Say "OK Google" at any time, even with the display off, and Assistant stirs to life. Break your phone? Google offers - in the US - accidental damage protection. Can't decide precisely which moment you want to photograph? Burst shot makes the call for you. Tired of shaky-hand video? Google's electronic stabilization is the real deal. Questions remain, though. Why is the Pixel commanding such an exceptional premium over last year's Nexus devices? Does the Pixel really do anything those phones don't, or will soon be able to? Can Google really claim to be a competitor on the level of Apple and Samsung? The answers here aren't so clean-cut. (Note: This review will refer to the Pixel as a single phone in many places for the sake of brevity and my own sanity. While there are two versions, with the screen and battery being the only differences, they are essentially one phone in two sizes. Even Google's retail boxes for them are the same. Constantly having to refer to the Pixel and Pixel XL would become tiresome and pointless. When the two devices diverge in experience or aspect, I will be clear about which I am discussing.) The Good Camera This may be the best smartphone camera ever. It's not just the quality of the photos, but the experience - this camera is so fast. Battery life So far, I'd say the Pixel XL has offered battery life basically comparable to the Snapdragon version of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge, which is very respectable indeed. Google's Android and perks Well, it's a good thing in my opinion. No bloatware, the latest version of Android, and some Pixel-exclusive (for now) features like Google Assistant, Smart Storage, unlimited full resolution Photos cloud storage, and more. Speed The Pixel is a very quick phone indeed. While it probably won't be running laps around an iPhone 7, it's consistently snappy and responsive in a way some phones this year have struggled to manage. Four carriers Google's new phone is SIM unlocked and works on all four major US carriers, and you won't get the runaround from Verizon, either - this is a true four-carrier device. The Not So Good Price There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL. Speaker While not without its merits, the single bottom-firing speaker is a definite downgrade from last year's Nexus 6P. Non-expandable storage Yeah, we know, Google - you don't like microSD cards on phones. The Pixel was a chance to make a clean break on this stance, but no such luck. No ruggedizing The iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 are IP67 and IP68 certified, respectively. The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance. A bit dull This one is personal, but I just can't get excited about the way the Pixel looks. In Very silver, it's a kitchen appliance. In Really blue, it's an aluminum blueberry. In Quite black it's at least inoffensive... to the point of boredom. This phone's design just feels too "playing it safe." Design and materials Historically, Google's Nexus phones have always been a bit of a toss-up in regard to their actual look and feel. The Nexus 5 looked great, but its plastic frame was unashamedly cheap and things like the power and volume keys seemed to reflect that. The Nexus 6 was an awkwardly upsized Moto X - I don't think much more needs to be said about that. Even the Nexus 6P, often considered by fans to be unimpeachable, simply isn't all that cohesive and coherent. Its cyclopian glass cover for the camera and various antennas was divisive at best. And while it was the first all-metal Nexus, it did feature a plastic piece on the rear "chin" area of the phone that seemed to say "we did what we could with what we had." Not to mention that its smaller sibling, the 5X, looked completely different. The Pixel and Pixel XL feel like solid bricks of aluminum (if lighter). The antenna bands are barely able to be felt. The glass window on the rear transitions smoothly into the metal frame. Does the Pixel have the almost bizarrely perfect tolerances of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge? No. But the Pixel is clearly a cut above any Nexus in the highly unscientific "how expensive does that smartphone feel" test. Sitting on the right edge of the phone, the buttons for power and volume are responsive and exceptionally clicky (even better than Samsung's, in my informed button-feel opinion). The USB-C port is bottom-center, and the headphone jack is up at the top-left. The fingerprint scanner, the same model as last year's Nexuses, is on the back. The look of the Quite black finish is uniform, with a slightly smoother texture than the 6P. Everything just looks like it's supposed to fit together here. I find the silver and white version gels considerably less well. If you're going to put up with a white surround on the front of the phone, the slightly absurd but fun Really blue color is the way to go (sadly, Google did not provide a blue unit to us). The 2.5D display glass surround gives the Pixel a gentle accent on an otherwise sparse front panel. Apart from the front-facing camera and the occasionally-visible sensor window below the earpiece speaker, there's not much that stands out. Go around back, and there's nothing too loud happening, either, at least on the dark finish. The "G" logo is the only branding on the exterior of the phone, and it's not even all that prominent. Lacking a camera hump on the rear, the Pixel really is a minimalist phone design. Frankly, for what praise I can give to Google on the look and feel of quality (seriously, screw camera humps), I can't award much for actual appearance. At its best, in the black finish, the Pixel looks vaguely generic. I realize the Pixel team has been all about relatively stealthy, sleek designs, but nothing about the Pixel to me really makes it look or feel related to the Chromebook Pixel or Pixel C. At best, I'd say Google has made a phone that won't have the issue of creating design baggage for a successor device. I suppose the Pixel is uninteresting to look at in the way a 1990s Lexus is uninteresting to look at. It's boring because it's supposed to seem grown up. But the more I look at it, the more I use it, the more I feel that Google was deliberately inoffensive with its industrial design here, and I'm really not sure that was a great decision in a market where making a product stand out has become increasingly difficult. The Pixel is a phone that seems to say "You're just going to put a case on me anyway, why should I dress up for the occasion?" And with Google's new flashy artist live cases, that could well be a point. I don't think it means the phone has to be quite so drab, though. Display The Pixel XL's 5.5" Quad HD Super AMOLED display is excellent. It offers adequate brightness outdoors, the superb viewing angles we've come to expect of AMOLED displays, and vivid contrast. Google also hasn't tuned the display to rigid color accuracy, instead seeming to end up somewhere between the typical oversaturation of, say, Samsung, and the highly-calibrated iPhone. Comparing to a Galaxy S7 edge in the "basic" mode, which is exceptionally accurate, the Pixel XL clearly provides more saturation of colors to give them the "pop" factor that most other OEMs using AMOLED displays do. On the one hand, the extra saturation provides the perception of more contrast, which can be important for things like video, gaming, and virtual reality. On the other, for a phone so focused on providing an excellent camera experience, I always feel like I should be seeing the photos I take as accurately as possible so that I can better judge how they'll look not on my screen, but on everyone else's (read: iPhones). But this is an admittedly fringe concern, and one that simply won't bother most people. As calibrated out of the box, it's not as though the Pixel XL looks like Samsung's almost comically bright setup. It's just adding a bit of drama. There's an sRGB mode in developer settings if you want to use that, and it offers a far truer white point and colors, though you'll probably find it a bit dull if you're used to typical AMOLED displays. But if you want to be serious about your smartphone photography, it's an excellent toggle to have. Unfortunately, I sent our 5" Pixel off for a video review the moment I received it, so I couldn't compare the displays of the two. I would assume a similar calibration and character, though the fact that the smaller phone's screen has a lower resolution could mean there's more variance between the parts than normal. On the whole, though, the Pixel XL offers an excellent display, if not one that's going to have Samsung looking over its shoulder. After all, they probably make it. Battery The section you may have jumped to immediately is, I am afraid, going to leave you feeling unsatisfied. I have only used the Pixel XL, and while I would say the battery life has been solid overall, it's also been a bit unpredictable at times. But after the first two days, which I am ignoring out of hand (I find Android needs a day or two to "settle in" on a fresh install), things have been pretty good. You're looking for screen-on time figures, and we'll get there, but first: please remember that these apply to the way I use my phone. Not necessarily, or even probably, the way you use yours. I'm not trying to extract the very maximum screen-on figure, nor do I leave my phone's display on, idle, sitting next to me. Sometimes I'm on Wi-Fi (reducing power consumption), sometimes I'm not. I also have rather annoyingly poor AT&T reception in my apartment which can cause the mobile network to scan much more frequently if a phone is in my pocket. On average, I'm seeing between four and five hours of screen on time with the Pixel XL. If I were to be on Wi-Fi in my office all day, I could probably manage six without much trouble, too. I would say this is comparable to what I typically get with the Galaxy S7 edge (SD820 version), a device that has been lauded for its battery life. As such, I'm actually pretty happy with the Pixel XL in this regard. ... That all considered, I'm going to say my thoughts here have plenty of evolving to do. I'm on day six here - barely (as I write this, day five). I just don't have the data points yet to really say confidently that the Pixel XL provides good battery life, just the initial impression that it does. We'll put a pin in this and return later. As for the battery life of the 5" Pixel, I haven't used it, and can't really offer you anything there. Storage, wireless, and reception The Pixel is the first smartphone from Google to utilize UFS 2.0 storage, meaning substantially faster speeds than the eMMC chips of years past. How fast is that storage? Well, our favored storage benchmark appears to be having some bugs with Android 7.1 and is yielding very strange results - some weirdly fast, some oddly slow - and for now I'm going to forego publishing figures. (Of note: this was an issue with 6.0 last year, too.) But this is a Samsung storage part and I would strongly assume that it is very fast, because the Pixel feels quite fast, and operations like app installs and photo capture feel exceptionally quick, as well. As you know, the Pixel is available in either 32 or 128GB storage models, and I'm actually OK with that. Many people have bemoaned the lack of a 64GB model, but I think the real complaint is that the 128GB model costs $100 more than the 32GB, not that there is some missing storage "sweet spot" here. Out of the box, a little over 24GB of storage is available on the 32GB model. By the time I loaded up all of my apps and signed in to everything, that number was around 18GB. Needless to say, you know what your storage needs are better than I do - the 32GB Pixel is plenty for me, but it may be woefully inadequate for others. If you're the kind of person who rapidly fills up your device's storage with photos, though, that ceiling may not be a worry - Google's new Smart Storage feature will automatically delete local copies of photos and videos taken on your phone that are more than 90 days old when your local storage starts to run low. It will only delete photos and videos that have copies in the cloud on Google Photos, of course. On the wireless front, the Pixel has the standard array of features you'd expect of a modern smartphone - Wi-Fi ac support, Bluetooth 4.2, a host of LTE bands (four-carrier compatible in the US), and NFC. The real question is whether or not any of them have posed any issues during my testing, at least for me. I will say that mobile data has been stellar, even in my AT&T-deficient apartment. The Pixel gets better reception than most phones I test on AT&T, actually. My AT&T-branded Nexus 6 will miss about half my calls if it's just sitting on my desk - the Pixel misses none, and only loses reception if I put it in my pocket. It seems Google and HTC did their homework here. Bluetooth, too, has worked very well for me. Pairing to my car was exceptionally quick, and I've not had any issues with it at all (unlike last year's Nexuses), though I will say the range doesn't seem fantastic, as streamed audio will cut out if I put my phone in my pocket instead of the cup holder. Wi-Fi is where I've had hiccups. My router's signal is poor in many areas of my apartment, often causing devices to flip between the 2.4 and 5GHz networks. The Pixel has had significant trouble with this at times, forcing me to manually toggle the Wi-Fi on a number of occasions to get it to reacquire a reliable connection. There's also a visual bug that correlates with this issue - my quick settings interface will show I'm connected to one network, but when I go into settings, it says I'm connected to the other one. It's an annoyance, but if my Wi-Fi reception wasn't so crappy I doubt it'd be an issue in the first place. Speaking of Wi-Fi, like the Nexuses now have, the Pixel supports Google's Wi-Fi Assistant to automatically secure connections to networks that may pose privacy concerns. It's nice to have. Call quality has been quite good - the Pixel's earpiece speaker is actually one of the best I've used, and even non-HD voice calls have surprisingly decent clarity. The earpiece speaker is loud without being shrill, so I think that helps, too. Audio and speakers The Pixel's headphone amplifier is reasonably powerful, though I did find it's not quite as potent as the one on Samsung's Galaxy S7. Testing with a number of pairs of headphones, I found the audio quality excellent and never saw a need to crank the volume beyond 65-70% or so. I'll be flying in the next couple of days, so I'll get some more experience with how the output of the headphone jack does in loud ambient conditions. As to the single, bottom-firing speaker? Well, it's not going to magically sprout into a front-facing stereo array, nor is it going to convince anyone that there was a worthy tradeoff made here. The quality of the speaker is actually quite good, I'd say it sounds more natural and full than those on devices like the Galaxy S7 and Moto Z (sorry, I don't have a 6P to compare to). But its output is noticeably lower, and it's no substitute for two speakers that actually face... your face. Google did a good job given the design directive here, but beyond that, it's nothing to write home about. As to that second, speaker-grille-looking thing on the bottom? It's just an oversized inlet for the microphone so that the phone looks symmetrical. Nothing to see here. Camera Google did it. In my opinion, the Pixel is the best smartphone camera on the market. It's not just the quality of photos, it's everything that makes the camera so capable and simple. To start, it's incredibly fast - just as fast as Samsung's world-beating S7 camera to launch, but even faster when actually shooting. You can fire off five or six photos in a row without skipping a beat, something that will cause most other smartphones to choke and stutter on buffer. Granted, after those five or six, the phone does need a few seconds to collect itself - but it gets those shots every time. I've simply never used a smartphone camera that is this fast. That's not to even speak of Google's Smartburst mode, which automatically picks the best shots in a rapid-fire capture initiated by holding down the shutter button. While not as reliable on focus as Samsung's crazy-fast dual pixel AF, or as able to draw out light in extremely dark conditions, the Pixel makes up for these technical shortcomings with a host of practical advantages and photo quality that, to me, feels the most natural and realistic of any smartphone this year. The level of detail the Pixel can capture in a macro shot is incredible - the kind of thing that I'd only previously associated with the iPhone. In well-lit conditions, photos are incredibly crisp and detailed, without the over-processed, punchy look that can render a photo worthless at anything beyond a full-width square crop. This is so much more important than I think people tend to realize. Reframing a photo can completely change its character, and when your smartphone is doing all kinds of crazy edge contrast to make photos look "crisp" and colorful, things can look a lot messier when you really zoom in. The Pixel is an absolute cut above the competition in this regard, and as someone who does occasionally photograph things as an activity, I feel I can rely on it not just to capture a scene, but to allow me to manipulate it after the fact. Say what you will about manual controls, but this feels like a photographer's smartphone camera. You can capture candid moments with the exceptionally quick launch, use Smartburst to make sure you get the right shot, and let Google's brilliant HDR+ worry about the exposure and contrast. Google does offer an exposure value slider (handy) as well as white balance modes, too. You can even lock the focus by long-pressing on the viewfinder. In the dark, the Pixel still performs well, though it doesn't quite have the magic trick level of light gathering that Samsung's phone does (I mention the S7 because it was my previous smartphone camera pick). Though, the S7 tends to seemingly create light where there is none at all, while the Pixel is just very good at making use of the light that is available. So, the Pixel may not offer world-beating autofocus speeds (it's a bit wonky at times, actually - hopefully it will get better), have the widest aperture lens, or use two sensors in tandem, but I firmly believe it offers the best overall camera experience on any smartphone, full stop. As for Google's touted video stabilization? It definitely works. I didn't have any extreme circumstances under which to test it, but for just holding your phone and walking around shooting video, it makes a huge difference. I mean, I doubt you'd think I was using a gimbal, but it's still very smooth. And up to this point in the camera section, do you know what all of the samples share in common? They're all heavily cropped versions of much larger photos. Here are the originals of the four I've shown you. And now, for the larger sample gallery (some images here have been cropped as well). Previous Next Finally, let's talk about the electronic image stabilization. It works! I have a video sample, shot in 4K, below, to demonstrate it. It does give video a slightly jarring panning effect if you're too subtle with your movement, but overall? For something shot with one hand over my head, this is incredibly smooth. Performance Is the Pixel fast? Yes. But it isn't going to change your definition of phone speed forever. I'd say the Pixel is roughly as fast as a Moto Z, which is a Very Fast Phone indeed - probably in the top three quickest Android phones currently out there. The Pixel feels very responsive, but I tend to think all of Google's "we can't talk about it, but we did things to make this phone fast, evil, terrible things" was a lot of huff and puff. It gets predictably decent scores in Octane. It gets predictably decent scores in pretty much any benchmark. But they're exactly what you'd expect of a Snapdragon 820 phone - they don't tell a story, they don't give you any actionable information. I can still make enough touch inputs that the animations start to lag behind my finger, and there's still a stutter when you open up the don't-call-it-Google-Now pane in the launcher, and the settings app sometimes takes a second to catch its breath and populate the menu list when you start it up. Where the Pixel has shined for me so far is in the consistency of its performance. Yes, in a side by side app load test, you might see many phones basically keep up with the Pixel. But it's that one time you go to bring up Maps and it's out of memory on your Galaxy S7 and it takes like 10 seconds to load up but you really need to get directions somewhere because you're stopped at a light and you have to decide if you're going left or right ahead. When it's crunch time, the Pixel always seems to maintain its composure and get you where need to go. In short? It feels a bit more like an iPhone. That's not to say I think the Pixel is as fast as the new iPhone - it probably isn't, by virtue of silicon alone. Whether this performance manages to remain consistent over the coming weeks and months will be the much bigger question, and it's one I just can't answer now. Software You know what Android 7.0 is all about - I'm not going to re-review it here, because that would be silly. But Android 7.1 and the various Pixel-exclusive features are definitely worth taking a look at, so let's break them down. Google Assistant Do you use Google voice queries or commands? No? Then you're probably never going to use Assistant, either, unless you have a deep and unrequited love of chatbots. Google talks a big game on Assistant, but the reality is that we've already had everything Assistant can do embedded in the Google app for a long time now. Assistant just gives us a new conversational interface and some slightly more human dialogue on occasion. That demo on stage where the presenter made a dinner reservation with only their voice? Well, it can do that... with a limited number of restaurants that basically cannot be discovered in any easy way. It might support more places in the future, perhaps even probably will, but who knows when? This is the problem any time Google unveils a major new software product: we're given the dog and pony show with all the grand possibilities and then... we wait. I appreciate what Google is trying to do here. Really, I do. I think the potential of Assistant is amazing. But the experience right now is... not. It's just Google's intelligent search results with a more streamlined interface. Can you reserve a table for dinner with Assistant? Yes... if Google Maps knows it supports Open Table, and not all that many restaurants in Los Angeles presently do, meaning I would never book a table this way in the first place - I'd just go on the web. Can you buy movie tickets? No such luck - I can get showtimes with links to click to start the checkout process, but not actually automate the activity beyond that. What about something easy, like ordering a Lyft? Nope... even though that's literally functionality built into the Google Maps app. And I'm not saying Assistant has to do all of this right out of the gate - it doesn't! It's just that the current Assistant experience simply isn't as intelligent or powerful as Google wanted us all to believe when it got on stage and talked about it like it was ready to change the world. Maybe it will be ready in a few years. Right now, we've got a skeletal version - a promising blueprint. But sorry, this isn't going to sell phones, not as it works now. Is it better than Siri? Sure. But so were the standard Google voice queries and commands we've had for years. That's not new. It's always a bitter pill to see Google paint us this picture of an amazingly useful product and then give us... not that thing. But if we've learned anything over the years, this is just how Google works. Assistant will evolve, it will get better, and eventually, maybe we'll all be using it. As is, Assistant is an easy way to do voice queries and commands, especially given it can be launched by long-pressing the home button. If you're tired of "OK Google"-ing every time you want to set a timer or an alarm, relief has arrived. That's a neat feature, but it says something that I think that's about the coolest thing Assistant does right now. Launcher shortcuts Launcher shortcuts are to Android as 3D touch shortcuts are to iOS. That's really the deal here, except launcher shortcuts are slightly more narrow in scope. To activate launcher shortcuts, just long-press on an icon on a homescreen or in the app drawer. If the app has shortcuts, they'll appear. A bunch of Google apps already have them, though their usefulness is of varying degrees (Photos has an "I'm feeling lucky" shortcut - talk about a potentially risky click). So, you ask, how do you tell between the action to pull up launcher shortcuts versus move an icon? And the answer is you don't. It's the same thing. Yep, this is a a bit odd. Launcher shortcuts will immediately pop up when you long-press an icon, to move it, you then have to drag beyond a certain threshold, after which the shortcuts will hide away. It's really weird, because you end up getting two vibration feedbacks, which always makes me think for a moment that something has gone wrong. I can't say this implementation is exactly ideal, and it's almost certainly going to confuse a few people who will think they've done something other than try to move their icons by long-pressing them. Anyway, here are a few examples of the shortcuts. YouTube: Trending, subscriptions, search Settings: Battery, Data usage, Wi-Fi Play Music: Recent activity, My library, I'm feeling lucky Calendar: New reminder, New event Play Store: My apps Photos: I'm feeling lucky, Free up space I'm still not 100% sure how to feel about launcher shortcuts. On the one hand, I love that Google is looking into more power user style device tools, things that can speed up common activities and tasks. On the other? This feels slightly clumsy as implemented. Maybe a gesture would have made more sense here? I don't know. I am definitely curious to see how many apps implement this feature, though, as it's part of Android 7.1 and can be used by any launcher via an API. Enhanced backup This one actually has flown under the radar, and I'm not sure why. The Google Pixels automatically back up your apps, app data, contacts, SMS (!), Wi-Fi passwords, call history, and various settings in Google Drive. Now, Android has done some of this for years. Contacts in your Google account, for example, are old hat. But SMS is new, and automatic app data backup in Drive is still fairly low on adoption, so hopefully this "all in one" backup being advertised as a Pixel feature will get developers to utilize it more. But the big idea here is that Google wants you to have an iPhone-like experience when you set up your next Pixel a year or two from now - everything should just come over. Whether it will work that well in practice, we'll have to see. I did not test the new cabled restore system on the Pixel, but Google seems pretty psyched about it, especially since it works with iPhones. I'd be curious myself to see how that experience would be. Moves (gestures) Android's settings app has a new menu, and it's called Moves. Moves currently is home to three features: double-tap power to launch the camera, double-twist while in the camera to switch between the front and rear facing sensors, and the ability to swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access your notification shade. They all work! There's not much else to be said. The swipe-down gesture on the fingerprint scanner can be initiated a second time to bring up the quick settings interface, and swiping down will hide the tray again. Honestly, it's not terribly responsive and can be difficult to get to work reliably sometimes. I never was a fan of this feature on Huawei devices for the same reason - it just feels a bit gimmicky. But it's there if you want it. Night light Night light is a simple feature you've probably seen on other phones already - it lowers the brightness of the screen's blue pixels to reduce eye strain in low light, supposedly reducing the chance the display will stop you from falling asleep when you should. You can turn it on at any time, as well as set a schedule or use Google's sunrise and sunset data to engage it automatically. I find the sunset timing less than ideal, since I don't go to sleep around sunset, so I use the custom schedule. There are no options to adjust the intensity of the effect. Wallpapers Holy crap there are a ton of new wallpapers on the Pixels, including a bunch of new live wallpapers. Live earth wallpapers are 3D renderings of famous landmarks that shift perspective when you unlock your device or swipe between homescreens. I hope to see even more of these published as time goes on, because they're awesome. Live data wallpapers either correspond to your battery level, the time of day, or weather conditions - they're very stark and abstract. I love everything about this, it really gives you some interesting new ways to personalize your device. This is in addition to literally dozens of new static wallpapers that you can have change daily, with categories like landscapes, cityscapes, life, earth, and textures. I love that Google is using things like 500px and its own social network, Google+, to source the images, too. That means the potential for a lifetime of beautifully curated wallpapers. Sure, there are great apps for this as well, but a lot of people never discover them. It's just one of those little things I appreciate. OS look and feel, Pixel launcher, Nougat generally Many of us have been using Nougat for months now, and we know what it entails. There are few things that the Pixel phones bring to the software equation that aren't available right now on a Nexus 6P, and those it does are covered in detail above (seriously, you are not missing out on Assistant - Pixel owners are Google's beta testers). One thing that won't be coming that we haven't discussed, though, is the overall aesthetic of the Pixel's software. Google has updated the entire look and feel of the device setup, given many items in the system UI blue accents, and changed the navigation keys - they're solid, with a concentric circle around the home button. When you tap the home button, four little colored dots fly out briefly, with a long press causing them to fully extend and activate the Assistant. There is also the Pixel launcher, leaked extensively in the last couple of months. The Pixel launcher is basically just the Google Now launcher with that weird pill-shaped "G" button to bring up the search box and a date and weather widget (it no longer displays time redundantly). Oh, and some round icons, but they're not mandatory (thankfully). Anyway, if you know the Google Now launcher, you know the Pixel launcher. There are no new settings to tweak, it really is just a light re-skin. What we're seeing here, though, is much more important in a wider context: Google is making an Android skin. A skin that, presumably, it will not share with anyone else. I will watch with great interest as Google's Pixel skin evolves and changes over time, and what makes it into stock Android versus what remains exclusive to the Pixel devices. And because I didn't know where else to put it: Google added a reboot button. Yay. Stability At this time, aside from the Wi-Fi issue I mentioned above, I have one bug to report: "OK Google" always-on listening sometimes stops working, and the only remedy is to reboot the device. The phone is stable and works as expected. Of course, given how long I've been using it, it's very possible issues may arise - things I just haven't noticed yet. For now, though, it's smooth sailing. Value I've decided to add this category to our phone reviews, at least for the time being, because I think value is a discussion worth having in its own right, not merely as a fulcrum upon which to balance an entire review. It can make having conversations about a product's merits difficult, and make it too easy to dismiss some products on what really is a single facet alone. So, how does the Pixel stack up on value? We're going to be judging this on the basis of prices in the United States, as we are a US-based blog with a largely American audience. The Pixel line is priced exactly as the iPhone 7 is. You start at $649 for the smaller, 32GB variant, and the larger 128GB variant goes up to $869. Google lacks a 256GB SKU, so technically it's not an exact match, but for the models Google does sell, it really is a mirror image. Is a Google Pixel worth iPhone money? I think if you contend that an iPhone is worth $649, then yes: the Google Pixel is absolutely worth that. But many people vehemently disagree with that premise. If you take the Google Pixel merely as the sum of its parts and put up the $769 Pixel XL against the $499 Nexus 6P, are you going to find nearly $300 of extra "value" there? I mean, no. You're not. That's like taking a $40,000 Mustang GT and comparing it to a $100,000 Porsche 911. Is there $60,000 more performance there? No. If all you care about are the raw numbers, the Pixel isn't an amazing value proposition, and Nexus fans understandably take issue with this. the Nexus 4, 5, 5X, and 6P all had MSRPs that were competitive, if not highly competitive, when they were released. The Google Pixels aren't really concerned with this, and I don't think Google is making an argument that they are. You're buying into Google's promise that these are the devices that will receive the highest level of support and exclusive features going forward. If that proposition is appealing to you, let's consider a few other factors. First, Google does not and likely never will offer the in-store support experience Apple does. If you buy direct from Google, using your warranty, extended or otherwise, means phone or email support and physically mailing out a device that is broken. This is not ideal, and we'll have to see if Google's support staff offers an experience a cut above typical phone manufacturers (I heard that for last year's phones, they were generally pretty good about this stuff, but I'm sure there are horror stories). Next, there's the ecosystem argument. If you buy an iPhone, it does stuff in concert with your other Apple products - be it a MacBook, an iMac, an iPad, or an Apple Watch. You can read your iMessages on your laptop, for example. Google has... Chromebooks. And Android Wear! But really, Google has built those device ecosystems around a much more open model, and I think we'll have to wait until next year to see what their grand vision for a tightly-integrated hardware ecosystem really is. But given people pay basically as much for a Galaxy S7 or S7 edge, which similarly lack such ecosystems, I think that's a bit of a red herring. So, are the Pixels good value for money? Sure, if you're of the opinion that an iPhone is good value for money. Are they great value for money? Probably not. In that sense, they're typical. What you're paying for here is more the promise of future support, advanced software features, and for an experience that is purely Google. Conclusion I feel that after the pricing was leaked, many people expected that Google would pull a rabbit out of its hat with the Pixel. There had to be something more. The truth is, it's just a very good phone, and one that Google is now making the focus of its efforts. It is the first phone with a Google software skin, and the first phone developed by Google independent of the actual Android team (well, as independent as any manufacturer). That's quite interesting: Google has made clear that the Pixel team and the Android team have a "firewall." But that doesn't stop the Pixel team from working with all the various other groups and products inside Google, and that's how we've ended up with the first, and for now only, phone with Google Assistant. The Pixel offers an incredible camera, fast software, premium materials, and high-end components. But it doesn't revolutionize the market, and it doesn't take any big risks. The Pixel, frankly, probably isn't that exciting to most people with a relatively new high-end smartphone. And I don't think it's meant to be - Google's marketing makes clear that a mainstream audience is being targeted here. The Pixel does almost everything well. In fact, it does most things very well. And it does a few things exceptionally, like taking photos. So if you've pre-ordered a Pixel, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed: it's a delight to use, and I'm already deeply attached to the Pixel XL I've been carrying for the past five days. Even the notification sounds are just right to my ears. But if you were a skeptic looking for some hidden killer feature, some justification for a price you found unthinkable? It's not as though Google was hiding the ball when they announced it. They told us what it was, and that's what it is. Google will almost certainly lose some Nexus fans over the Pixels and their high prices, and that is probably something they're well-aware of. Google isn't going after the people buying smartphones on a cost-to-spec basis, that much is obvious. Still, I very much like the Pixel, even with its slightly boring design and iPhone pricing. I like the idea of quarterly maintenance releases - releases I will get first - that install silently in the background while I continue to use my phone. I like my monthly security patches. I like having phone or chat support just a few taps away if I break my phone and need to replace it. I love the camera. The Pixel is a very hard phone not to like, and that really is a rare thing.

As always. I love your ruthlessly considered review style (something I think applies to all AP staff) compared to so many other fluffy tech blogs and mainstream news sites. I have a silver Pixel on pre-order and I'm now more excited than ever. The things that have always been most important to me are speed/performance, Google's version of Android, timely updates, decent battery life, a decent camera... and build quality. I've been holding onto my Nexus 5 for three years now despite it now falling short in the final three criteria. With the Pixel, I'm finally going to get the full package (assuming the battery is better than my N5!). The one thing I'm not entirely sold on is the EIS for video. It looks amazing... until you pan. It's a bit "video game". I think it needs a little more work, but that said I think it will work perfectly in certain applications. Google is on to something. I'm totally in love with the design. I find it wonderfully understated. The word that comes to my mind is confident. It doesn't scream "look at me" like Samsung and others tend to. Google is taking a page out of Apple's book - not by copying the iPhone design - but by taking inspiration from its philosophy and crafting something new. If the iPhone is Adam, the Pixel is Eve. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Except that I'd say the iPhone is like Satan. whispy_snippet Hahaha indeed... JD Stan? N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Yes. Stan D. Satan. Savan I have preorder Pixel XL on Oct 4, I don't care about free unlimited full resolution upload to Google Photo, I can still do that with standard resolution which works great. What are your thoughts on google giving some additional freebies to Pixel owner, such as free You Tube red subscription, some additional data for project fi users or something which actually give you pride in using it. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You get a free Daydream View. MJ Think bigger... Blonde with big boobs for a night. Marty Just compared prices of this Pixel and the iPhone 7. Pixel XL - 128GB: $869 IPhone 7+ - 128GB: $869 Since the Pixel is questionable because of being made by HTC, I'd rather have an iPhone 7. Also considering Safari is so much better than Chrome web browser, that's a plus. Falcon And support for 4yrs instead of 2yrs saltyzip Unlimited photo and video backup at original resolution is a big plus for Pixel, not forgetting 24/7 support too Max Johnson I'm going to admit, I am very impressed by this phone's camera. I also admit it is stupid to not allow a 64GB option. mrjayviper one of the selling points of pixel is Google assistant. So Google wants to charge more for the chance to mine my personal data even more? They should be paying me instead? Bryan Breguet I really, really dislike that you think asking for a properly calibrated screen is nitpicking or for annoying people. It is not. It's not a fringe problem. yojetski i must say - this is one of the more honest reviews out there right now for the pixel. talks about the pros and cons (ahem-price) without the hate from naysayers. seriously it is understandable to not like a phone because of its price, but for alot of people to say that it is utter garbage because it's the same $ as an iphone without even trying it? kind of ignorant. my wallet is hurting but i am excited to replace this n6. Sir_Brizz I don't think most people here think it's necessarily bad (aside from the huge bezels and lack of stereo speakers maybe) but at the price it's at it is a much different conversation. I think it looks like a nice upgrade for my 6P... at almost double the price. RNC what is the space wallpaper on phone? looks good...any link for it? thnx 4ui812 I stopped reading after ... Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. Leon Not everyone buys phones to be on the bleeding edge. Sometimes, people just want a good phone that works and is well supported. For them, this might just be it. 4ui812 I see. Thanks. Falcon Its not as well supported as apple. With the same price abc People who pay 700+ for phone, definitely expect the bleeding edge. Otherwise, they'd buy a $200 phone that works. SHunter What the hell man; do you live in a Faraday cage? angryone The only reason I switched from an iPhone to an Android years ago was to have MicroSD storage, and I'm not interested in any phone without it. If I were going to give up on MicroSD, I would just go back to an iPhone. Max Johnson Google phones, aside from the first one, never had microSD. So to complain about no microSD on Google devices are pointless, now it's valid to say you rather get a different phone. Also going to iPhone doesn't fix the problem of not having microSD. At least on Android you can connect an external USB device. me me So a few hours later I scroll in. I see 3 types of replies: 1) those who decided to buy the phone, justify themselves. 2) Those who say it is not worth buying at any price due to lack of what they want (SD slot, IP68, etc). 3) Those who say it is not worth the price but with a price drop would accept buying. If Google had set it at say half the price then it would be: a) moaning about its out of stock b) those who won't buy for lack of a feature. Prices will fall, it is just a matter of when, and really, the earlier we get the 1) morons out of the way who prop up the price, the earlier we can get to serve 3) whispy_snippet Prices will fall when the Pixel 2 launches. Part of what makes something a premium, desirable object is a high price tag. This is marketing 101. charlie Jason I'm a current 6P user. The battery life is not ideal. Under intense use the phone can noticeably heat up, slow down and stutter. The camera app lags. Screen not bright enough and too reflective, leading to poor sunlight performance. Still, there are enough reasons to love this phone for its price. Still photography is still incredible. Front facing speakers are great. I think I will stick with it for another year or two. My next phone would probably be an Oneplus, now that they don't have invite system anymore. Nexus has died and Google isn't offering a good value phone in the foreseeable future. Can't bear heavily skinned Android either. Jay Happy to read the review. Glad people are excited for this. Lots of IPhone comparisons here. If Google is really trying to take the IPhone approach, why can't they change the update OS policy to match Apple's as well? black What about the fast charging capability? Is it as fast as they claim? Does it make up for the small battery capacity? I'd like to know more about the Pixel's battery (not the XL's). Presjar Do a side by side vs the S7 Edge. It is even better than the Iphone7. Samsung make a far superior camera. The Sony sensor in the Pixel is not good enough considering the phone costs the same! Pedro Diego Fernández I don't know... I'm not a nexus fan but for a 800$ phone, I would expect something better than "very good"... that sounds like something you say at a restaurant meaning it's good enough not to send it back but nothing to get you excited... Maybe it's because for my budget I only consider phones for less than 300$ and feel really satisfied with them, so a 800$ phone should be something special to get my attention. So far the only thing special about the pixels is the "made by google" part which I don't think is enough... but time and sales will tell if this was a hit or a miss. I think the real question for the author would be "if you had to spend your own money, would you have bought this phone?" If I had the money I think would have gone Samsung S7 in a heart beat. olivrstal I really appreciate the detailed information about the display saturation in this review. Great job! I guess I probably have to go with that sRGB mode from the developer settings once again. Really enjoyed my time with the Nexus 6P but if there wasn't the sRGB mode I probably would've returned it. Out of the box the colors looked ridiculously oversaturated imo. (I do quite a bit mobile photography, so I want the photos to look somewhat natural on the screen for further editing.) With that Nexus 6P in the sRGB mode, the mode always was turned off, after the phone was shut down, so I always had to activate it again when I restarted the phone (which fortunately didn't happen that often because of that large battery.) Does anyone know if this is still the case and, if it is, if there is a way that I can maintain that sRGB mode even if I restart the phone? Garrett Bridges I was going to skip the first Pixel and go with next year's instead, but my 6P decided an impromptu trip from my pocket during a roller coaster was in order, so I pre-ordered one from Verizon the other day. Sadly it keeps saying it won't come until the 28th. :( I do have to say, this review dampened my expectations and excitement a little. You say it's a good phone, repeatedly, but not having much "great" to say about it made it seem like it has no wow-factor. I'm almost second-guessing my decision and thinking of going for another 6P. Someone help! :-x saltyzip Perhaps the Verge Review will convince you to stick with Pixel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJOgF15LLZk Garrett Bridges That's somewhat better. I envy reviewers getting sent these things! I have to finance this sucker because I'm still paying off my nuked 6P. Eric Horchuck To me this guy came off as a Samsung fan. I know that this is an opinion piece and not "journalism", by any stretch, but my god; I was waiting for "and the lack of a physical, front, home button...". ☺️. Also, for an Android site with Android fans maybe don't use iPhone comparisons (I haven't had an iPhone since the 4), I mean, who cares? I'll be ordering the Pixel XL (I'm thinking in silver since it's the first 'white front' Google phone (Nexus were always black front)) as soon as it's back in the Google store. I think it's awesome and not in a trendy way. Take care, all! JD David a samsung fan? What you smoking? C64 It's still an overpriced iPhone lookalike with huge bezels / chin evo34 Why do you care about looks so much? Do you pose with your phone in front of the mirror in the morning? C64 I look every day at it. So yes i care about the looks. If you can choose to wake up everyday next to a beautiful women or a ugly pig. You'll choose the pig? evo34 The fact that you compare your phone to a woman speak volumes... evo34 I don't fuck my phone C64 I doub you fuck anything JB Nice shoes 👍 Marcelove What a surprise David, with you praising the Pixel and trying to convince readers to buy it... /s Finally we found the android version of Nilay Patel... And like him, always denying any bias towards anything from Apple, everyone can cleary see now who personificates the same pattern when speaking about android... Phone_Addiction This is basically an android version of an iPhone and, yet it still gets love Benjamin Lehto I wonder how long the $1000 smartphone era will last, or more like, how long will the means remain viable for the majority of people that either buy them or get them on contract (which results in paying more over the length of the contract yes)? I get the impression that money is getting much tighter for more and more people and eventually you'd think that that would result in less "Things" being bought, and therefore ends in a new shift of premium devices simply not being purchased in the numbers needed to justify building these devices. I dunno. abazigal The smartphone remains an integral part of many people's lives. As long as this is the status quo, I daresay there will be no shortage of people willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a better user experience. BoFiS It's unfortunate that Google still refuses to put MicroSD slots on their devices, or stereo speakers, or waterproof them...but really I'm upset that the smaller Pixel is still pretty large, larger than the GS7, so really they have a large phone and an XL phone, how about a smaller, compact model?? Why is Sony the only company to understand that? Testraindrop "larger than the GS7" ... while having a smaller screen and onscreen buttons compared to the GS7... Singh Nexus 4 mentioned in the article ! Yay Max Johnson Still the best looking and most comfortable to grip Google phone. Singh And running Nougat like a boss 😎 JD When Google can offer 4-5 years of support then they can start charging iPhone like prices. Borgman You're going to be waiting a long while thereasoner You get 3 full OS versions(3 years)at minimum and all point updates with security patches continuing into year 4. What's more is that the phone won't slow to a crawl like old iPhones do when they try and run the latest OS version. What's more is the live on device support provided with the Pixel phones that is 24/7, now that's great support ! I know people with old iPhones who are afraid to update because of the associated performance issues old iPhones get. JD Where do you get 3 years? Just because some phones and tablets got didn't make it Google's official policy. They only promise 18 and 24 months for OS and security updates respectively which is a joke. I said I want 4-5 years of support, I never said I want 4-5 years of full OS (Letter change) updates, it would be great if Google did that but I'm looking for Product support. As much as people complain that Apple's updates slow down phones, at least the 4S had 5 years of security updates with it and you have the option of taking the update or not. You don't get a choice when a device is abandoned. A custom ROM isn't nearly the same I don't want to pay the money Google is asking for to hope that some volunteers will create a ROM with a homebrewed device tree in year 3. Sure 24/7 Live support sounds good (it's a start), but I want the option of a store front as well so I can walk in and show them a physical defect. thereasoner 18 months? Where did you get that from? Got a link? Nexus devices that I'm aware of have seen 3 OS versions in their life and when Google announced monthly security patches a while back they said that they would continue after OS updates stop. I came home with a "physical defect" ony wife's Motorola, the carrier changed it out on the spot the next day, no Moto Store required for that. JD Have you been living under a rock? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices thereasoner Lmao!! You need to check that again. " at least 2 years" of support is in addition to the 1st OS version/year you already have in the first year and Google only mentions 18 months when talking about devices AFTER they are no longer sold on the Google Store, as in 18 months MORE support than they already had while for sale on their online store. I know, math is hard :-) JD I know right math is hard. But you know what's harder learning to read. Look at the hard end dates of support for the Nexus phones dumb ass. But you know what's easy? your mom. thereasoner What are you like 12 years old? Lol. It says no guaranteed OS update for the 6p and 5x AFTER September 2017. There's no reason to believe that they won't get their 3rd OS version next fall like Nexus devices before it. You're reading it as support ends September 2017 but they're NOT saying that. In fact they should get next years OS version AND any related point updates over the following year as well as security patches for 18 more months seeing that they just came off the Google Store earlier this month. That puts both of those devices 6 months into year 4 before support end exactly like I said ! JD Let me go tell my 2013 Nexus 5 it's going to be supported in to march 2017. Oh wait... thereasoner Lmao! Your Nexus 5 launched with Android K and also received Android L and Android M. That's 3 full versions and years of support. Google wasn't doing security patches for long so their improved support that has devices getting security patches into year 4 or 18 months after they stop selling them may not apply to 2013 devices. The point is that Google has improved support into year 4 now and you have them getting worse with only 18 months to 2 years of support apparently because math and reading comprehension isn't your thing! Just stfu already! JD Listen you fucktard Google hasn't said shit now stfu while I go line up and plow your mom dcdttu tl;dr Design - meh Display - meh+ Battery - meh Storage - meh Wireless - meh Reception - meh+ Audio - meh Speakers - meh Camera - great! Performance - meh Software - meh Google Assistant - meh Launcher Shortcuts - sure Backup - great! Moves - meh Night Light - meh Wallpapers - great! OS look and feel - meh Stability - fine Value - meh Conclusion - review might have been written on an extremely dreary day Testraindrop Sums it up perfectly, that comment should be featured under the article ;) Da Fuq "Right now, we've got a skeletal version" Is it rich in calcium? Zack Kibler Wow a mention of a Samsung screen that includes the Basic mode. I get so mad when people compare, say the iPhone 7, to the GS7 and talk about how super-saturated the Samsung is compared to the natural colors of the iPhone. Basic mode is pretty much perfect, if realistic color is what you're after. MyClRental AtGmail I'm surprised that there is no mention of the Pixel's value in the increased availability/timeliness /frequency of OS/security/bug/feature/function updates and upgrades that are often delayed and/or undelivered by the double negative lock gates of third-party android device vendor & mobile device carrier, PARTICULARLY that Bastion of Inactivity otherwise known as Verizon. abazigal I will believe it when I see it. arthur if the price would be arround 500 euros = good phone... ... but its not! ps: nobody likes those bezels! Cat Astrophy Those regular security updates better not break my root Rod Those should be the least of your concerns. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/58npsl/71_appears_to_aggressively_fix_errors_to_the/ Melannie Sandi If it is not as good as other devices (including iphone) and as expensive as an iphone I would rather spending that much money on an iphone. Coming from google I couldn't be more disappointed. As you said it doesn't have anything new, cool, killer, is not even better, is not even among the best, is even boring, but just because it is from google it is easier to forgive all those things missing for tiny details like a "great camera" giving excuses like mainstream market targeted. Is too expensive for no reason, just cause they wanted it to be expensive Devin Rodriguez How is Android Auto with the Pixel? Is there Assistant integration or maybe Auto 2.0? Ben Sin that part of the review where it explains how unremarkable the phone is "is the battery the largest? no is the screen the best? no" onto the part where David justifies the phone's high points sums up why the Pixel isn't worth it to me, as someone who lives in Asia. all the cons he mentions -- no waterproofing, no microSD expansion, no OIS -- are all quite real complaints. but the pros he lists? being able to switch carriers? no bloatware? lol those are all US carrier BS problems. there's no bloatware in international phones, there's no problem switching sim cards. and stuff like "google photos stores your pics at full resolution" is cool but google photos already let you store unlimited photos in a slightly compressed, but still more than enough for most people, format. Testraindrop Yeah, while its mentioned that this review is from a US point of view, outside of the US the positive points just don't really exist (except camera). - Assistant: Will be more or less useless like Google Now outside US - Cloud backup: 4K videos up+downloading eats all free data in day - Carriers: GSM, would be bad if it would not work on any carrier - 24/7 support: lets see about that in each country outside US Marco I have played with an XL at the store, and while shooting 1080p videos at 60fps, I've noticed the display is flickering, and also the video stuttered a couple of times for the first 2 seconds. Anyone noticed that? Maybe it's just because they are demo unit? I really want to switch to this baby and finally ditch ios.... Danske I believe that would the camera frame rate picking up the store's lights "frame rate" if you know what I mean. For example, fluorescent light tubes usually flicker at a frame rate higher than the human eye can see, but when they're on their way out, they flicker low enough to be seen with the classic eyeballs. Rod "Classic eyeballs" I lol'ed Luiz Marin i really hope that theres a led notification... _jack_ that should be much more mentioned and appreciated in reviews :) Rod There is a RBG led. bugdroid It's sooo beatiful :-) I want to eat it. likurges this phone gives me no reasons to buy it if I look at the competition Rod The competition doesn't deliver stock Android and quick updates. likurges Well in my case I really don't care about stock, if anything I prefer some skins because of the more festures that they offer. As for the updates its Nice to have them quickly but again it's not really that important to me. I want a fast phone with good battery like, great Camera that looks good, I would buy the note 7 but well... I think the 7 edge will do Rod Pixel looks ok, and has the best camera. Give it a try. likurges I personally don't like how it looks and the Camera is comparable to the se but it has a lot less features. Another thing that I really don't care about nor can I fully use in my country is Google asistent. This is why I can't think of a single reason to buy this phone Rod What features? Unlimited backup for photos/videos is nice, too. Michael Pahl When HDR is set to ON and not Auto, the camera is PAINFULLY slow.... 4-5 times slower than the Note 7 Like OG Droid Turbo slow. Mike Mine was delivered today and I am very, very impressed. It feels damn near perfect in every respect. I know it doesn't have every desirable feature and it's priced at a premium - but just use the device before rushing to judgement. Đức Thành I am happy to hear that. Sounds really great. kaibosh What a dull, uninspired phone. Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost? Also, what is with you guys talking about lag because of how many apps you have installed? Seriously? I have over 400 apps on my OPO 1 and there is no lag - ever. Are you people actually running stock operating systems? Like, for real? There is not one single feature listed in the above review that I don't have on my phone. Yes, that includes the Assistant. I can't believe reviewers don't have the balls to call Google out for a cookie cutter boring brick of a phone that is 40% overpriced. It has a fast camera - and that is *all* it has. Rod Getting updates. The-Sailor-Man Who cares? First- Google always lag with the new features that other phones have. Second, many updates slower the phones. Rod I didn't say anyone cared, I simply responded to the author's question: "Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost?" illstplaya . I only have one problem and that's the very weird and extremely ugly white or colored background behind the apps. Why does the camera have that ugly white circle behind it? Same goes for the play music app and the play store and YouTube etc... That's just very ugly. The phone app has a blue circle behind it. The messaging app and a stupid circle behind it. Why do most of the apps have this crap? It's so bad. I've included a picture of my home screen, just to compare to the home screen on the pixel which shows the apps with the ugly circle behind it, and my screen that does not have that strange crap. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5c2677ae1ac8e07a727b2a9b8e72d8470bfe08e23d7466a2a554b2672c2ec2ff.png Đức Thành Because Google just started a circle icons trend for their apps. We all know it looks weird, but not much we can do about it but wait until we get used to it. [email protected] Is the new Assistant really better than Siri ? I can't get Assistant to even take a simple note. Sure, it does better with searching the internet for the Presidents birthday. But I want an assistant that can change an appt on my calendar. Siri can do that but Assistant can't. I want to be able to modify reminders. Or create reminders that show up in a specific place where I can see them all together. With Google who knows where your reminders are stored. Are they stored in Calendar or Inbox or Google Now or Keep. I don't know because reminders created in Assistant don't show up in any of those places for me. I asked Assistant the other day for my calendar. It brought up a Google search. WTF. Want Assistant to open an app. The reply I got yesterday was another Google search. So in the future it may be better, but right now I don't agree. I don't think Siri is necessarily better, but I would say at this point they are about equal. And with the recent companies Apple has purchased you better bet Siri is going to be getting much better. Assistant better work a lot better when Google Home comes out or there are going to be a lot of pissed off people. I want what Google is advertising not what they are working on. I don't want to be a tester. If it can't maybe someone will sue the crap out of Google for false advertising. And you better bet I will return mine if it can't do what Google shows in their videos. I am excited Google is getting into fully into hardware, but they better make sure it works or people will abandon it as fast as this bought it. Rod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiu5rfnhzo Yay Bubbles I will act as the voice of alarmist reason and tell you the truth. Don't buy it. I don't care what it costs or what it does. Google is a child with ADHD. It has dropped, cancelled, and screwed people on ALMOST every single hardware item it has sold. PROOF? SOURCE?: I bought a GOOGLE TV, a year later, Google dropped support, made a half ass update, and to this day, either the current apps don't work like they should or I am restricted in some manner from downloading apps which would make it work like ti should. Not a big deal, but here's the thing, when apple has a product, even if it's not the best, such as apple tv, they stick with it, support it, and refine it over time (or at least they used to under Jobs) Why commit to something which past experiences have proven will end in failure and heart ache. The choice is yours. Bye Felicia! Rod Well, I feel sorry for you, but I've had 4 Nexus devices, and all of them had 3 years of support. Nothing to whine about. Falcon I dont think he is talking about security updates. All nexus only received 2 major updates (name change updates) Rod Sorry, I didn't specify the type of update. But, 3 years of support for a smartphone is pretty decent nowadays. Of course Apple nails it with those 5 years, though. Hexlattice I just saw a Verizon Pixel commercial and I'm honestly confused by how Verizon gets away with this "only at Verizon" lie that they're saying in this commercial... Like, I feel bad for anyone that believes it. João Victor Schiavo "and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment." LMAO Msinko I could never. Looks too much like a iPhone, Android 7 as well. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Awesome, tremendous phone. The best all-around phone on the planet, bar none. JohnyNoLegs Although not perfect, it makes my enjoy using my phone. Zero lag, always keeps apps in the background, amazing speaker and camera, display is fantastic (not the best compared to my note 7), but as a whole I would take this phone over 6p or note 7 any day. Roberto Virga "The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance." I disagree. Here's a real-life anecdote. A few days ago I went to play Pokemon Go under a light rain. From time to time, a few drops of rain fell on my Nexus 6P, which I promptly wiped with a paper tissue. At the time, the phone looked fine. However, later that day, I experienced several random reboots, something this phone had never done before. Luckily, whatever humidity had accumulated inside slowly dissipated, and I haven't experienced any more random reboots since that day. This experience has taught me several things, such as - you could do much worse than IP53; - while for a smartwatch I wouldn't settle for anything less than IP67, for a phone resistance to light or moderate rain might be enough for me. Linked Devices Besides the camera and Google assistant. What features does this phone really offer over the 8 month older S7? The S7 has the Gear VR already fully up and running with enough quality titles that I haven't been able to get through all of them. It has the exclusive SAPA engine compatible with iRig, sound camp, thumb jam etc to do ultra low latency studio quality audio production and live processing for on stage without missing a beat (the only other phone line that can do the same is the iPhone). It has Samsung cloud and simple sharing which lets you share hundreds of pictures or any file actually of any file size to anyone in your contact list which basically amounts to free web hosting It is IP68 water resistant which allows the phone to be used as an underwater camera which works amazingly well with their auto sensitivity adjusting screen. It can take pictures on raw mode and has a fully fleshed out pro mode making it a truly professional camera. It's display is literally the most accurate available on the market right now. It features the Knox Subsystem which lets you run two fully encrypted separate isolated Android environment simultaneously. It has Samsung pay which has far broader compatibility than Android pay--it literally works anywhere you can swipe a card. It's battery lasts a full hour or two longer. It runs faster and with less lag as demonstrated in side by side comparisons. It has 24/7 tech support by voice, text or even video chat via the Samsung + app. The list can go on. Why would the pixel cost more than the S7? That just doesn't make any sense. You're getting so much less. Pursuer The laggy iPhone 7 still wins the battle??? Amit Avasthi I think the game is very different. Google is taking a leap to be first movers by controlling hardware to demonstrate what AI can do. It may also mean the new OS could come on pixel next Jeremy V. Riedl Hey, i know this is off topic, but when are you going to publish a review for the LG V20? You guys are dead last in doing this and usually the people i go to first for reviews. You published a hands on review almost two months ago and haven't published an actual review yet. Meanwhile Google releases a phone and you have a review published in like five days. Jeremy V. Riedl How long till you finish your V20 review that you started 2 months ago? This one you managed to get done in 5 days. Magdee Alshbith Hi I'm from London I just bought two of the Google pixel XL 128g and spend £819.99 on each one of them with the total cost of 1639.98 pounds for the two of them there's something really annoying and I didn't expect that from such a high-end phone by Google , it doesn't actually show the notification on each app !!!!!!🤔🤔 like how many missed calls I have received or how many emails I have received or how many WhatsApp messages or calls I have received UNTIL i must drop the notification bar from the top of the screen to be able to see and check them all or I have to go in to each app to see how many messages I have received !!!!!?? i expect that each app should have a notification sign and a number of how many messages or emails or calls received like any other Android and iOS device . and one more thing while you are typing a message and you want to go back between words and you want to add some adjustments and try to point between letters it's NOT actually flexible and accurate it will freezes up for a second because of spelling suggestions even when the words are correct this actually slow down the typing procedure a little bit . the typing experience is fine but switching between lines while you are typing it's slow and not flexible like the Samsung or the iPhone typing experience and even if you want to compose a message by Google voice typing it's slow and not always accurate . the two XL devices I have are the same with the typing and message voice experience!! I know this could be a little things but those are a MAJOR problem for Android users especially with this Price Tag you just don't expect some little problems like this and i know that Google has taking a long time to develop this device and they should be aware of such a little things that could be a major problem not to having this particular device compare to other smartphones in the market today . I hope this all could be fixed as soon as possible by in update from Google or I'm returning the devices back before the 28 days off not satisfaction time will end . Thiago Oliveira I know a bug: like some iPhone 5S, when Google Pixel is plugged on third party USB, the touch screen gets a bit irresponsive. kingRoot One one question : Can this be rooted easily by sing apps like KingRoot? Or we need a lengthy process? Владимир Петров First year for Pixel is just a test priod. Peaple will look at support, development of features, polishing the os and UI. If it held well until Pixel 2 come, then the smartphone worth it's money. By this I mean also working on mistakes like getting rid of the glass panel (it tends to break and create flares, scratches), improved durability (doesn't pass drop tests at all), portrait camera (50mm+), waterproofing. Assistant doesn't have support in other countries as well as 24 hour google support. Allo lacks backup. Etc... Now there is too much compromice. And google experience could be even better on the iPhone (the phone with the same price I mean). I used to have nexus 5 and I loved it! But 1 year waste with snapdragon 810 (let's tell the truth, it's unsuccessfull processor) made me switch to iPhone. This year I hoped to move back to Android, but Pixel dissapointed a little. Hope, that next year everything that google promised would work exactly right. TreasuresQueen This is a great phone! I do, however, have an issue with the Messenger app. It doesn't LOCK messages at all. The camera is awesome on it though I miss the ability to shake my phone and access the camera as I did on my Motorola phone. I wish the phantom space on the end of the phone was an additional speaker! My phone also overheats but then again, I'm playing Pokemon Go on it LOL KingRoot Google Pixel is just brilliance <3 - kingRoot Anas Ali This article is well written and very informative.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Latest Update for Google Home Gives It Upper Hand over Amazon’s Echo By Zara Ali Apr 21, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Home is the smart speaker that gives you an account of your every day and completes tasks by voice commands. It is one nifty device to have at your home to keep all the services streamlined. However, the only limitation on the device was its support for just one user account, but Google has changed it now. In its latest update, Google Home is getting multi-user support. This feature is currently limited to the users in the US but Google is expected to enhance the reach in the coming months. With this new update, Home users can train the device to recognise up to six different voices. It means that you can now connect different Google accounts on a single Google Home device. Multi-user support has made Google Home ideal for Home use as up to six family members can activate it with their voices. Related How To Connect Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora Accounts With Google Home Advertisement Google has employed its artificial intelligence neural networks technology to bring multi-user support to its smart home speaker. The same technology is used for Google search and Google translate. For now, only one account per user can be linked to Home. You cannot link both work and personal accounts with the device, you have to choose one. Related Google Home App Gets A New ‘Listen’ Tab For Easier Music Discovery And Streaming In a blog post about the latest update for Google Home, the company writes: When you connect your account on a Google Home, we ask you to say the phrases “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” two times each. Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person’s voice. From that point on, any time you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it’s you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds. Now that Google Home has multi-user support, we wonder if Amazon Echo would also get it anytime soon. Amazon’s team is tipped to be developing new features for the Echo, which will make it compatible with the third-party services. These services also include Google products that are not yet compatible with Google Home.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Play Music Is the Default Music Player for Galaxy S8 Loaded with Extra Benefits By Zara Ali Apr 21, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Samsung devices are not ideally bloat-free, in fact, the South Korean giant has faced quite a flak for its bloatware. The company has come a long way for its flagships and is now trying to steer clear of bloatware. In the latest development, Samsung revealed that Google Play Music would be the default music player on the Galaxy S8 lineup. We couldn’t be happier, as Play Music is any day better than any other third-party app brought by Samsung. Besides, Google Play Music is also showering some added benefits for the Galaxy S8. The service would allow users to save up to 100,000 songs the player for free. The storage capacity for the Galaxy S8 owners is almost double of what other phone users are currently getting. Making the deal sweeter, Google has also thrown in a three-month free trial of Play Music’s subscription-based streaming service. The audio library on Play Music includes more than 40 million songs, which means that the Galaxy S8 will have a huge spread of songs to choose and listen for free – for three months. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser Advertisement The benefits are not limited to Google Play Music only; the Galaxy S8 users would also get free access to YouTube Red. However, if you have already registered on YouTube Red, then this offer won’t be valid for you, even if you are a Galaxy S8 user. Google Play Music will also work with Samsung’s AI assistant – Bixby, which will debut on the Galaxy S8 later this Spring. Whenever Bixby comes on the phone, users will be able to command it to access Google Play Music. You just have to ask the assistant to “play music” and it will by default open Google’s Play Music app. For now, it is not clear whether the Galaxy S8 users would be allowed to tweak Bixby’s settings to make it choose their preferred music app for playing music by default. Related Google Accidentally Releases a “Confidential Internal Only” Update to Pixel XL To conclude, we would say that this partnership between Samsung and Google’s Play Music service seems legit. It stands to reason that many Galaxy S8 buyers would not use Google Play Music as the default app, as many users these days prefer services like Spotify, Tidal, Pandora, and others. However, it is still better that Samsung chose Play Music instead of coming up with its own service.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > From home to outer space, the new Google Earth is… From home to outer space, the new Google Earth is full of things to do By Julian Chokkattu — April 20, 2017 3:30 PM Subscribe Share Google Earth Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: It was already easy enough to lose yourself in Google Earth. Whether you’re dodging through the narrow alleys of Kobe, Japan, or skimming Lake Achen in Austria, Google Earth offers rich 360-degree content, along with spectacular satellite imagery that can satiate any hunger for exploration. But Google went a step further this week with a major update that not only redesigned the interface, but also added rich textual and visual content from partners such as BBC Earth, NASA, and the Jane Goodall Institute. The new Voyager tab acts as a curated magazine that houses stories from these select partners, and it even features never before seen behind-the-scenes content from shows such as Planet Earth II. There’s also plenty of packaged content from the Google Street View team you can check out. Say goodbye to any other plans you had this weekend, as we explore all the new possibilities in the new Google Earth. This is home The first address most of us type when we see the blue marble floating in space is home. It’s why one of the highlights of the Culture category in the new Voyager tab is a series called “This is Home.” This series takes a look at some traditional homes of cultures and people most of us may not know much about. There are five homes you can visit at the moment: an Inuit Igloo, Bedouin tent, Reed House, Sherpa home, and Greenlandic Illoq. Tap on one and you’ll be taken to the geographical coordinates, with a brief description of the person and the area. There are usually three “cards” telling the story of the culture and the home — the first shows the satellite view, the second offers a Street View 360-degree image, and the third takes us into the home itself. Stories of more homes are on the way. This is Home Nature and wildlife Google Earth With the new Voyager tab, you can learn more about nature and wildlife than ever before. Partners include BBC Earth, the Jane Goodall Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and The Ocean Agency, among others. What’s neat is that much of the content is from decades of back catalogs from these various agencies, and you can even find behind-the-scenes content that has yet to be aired — such as when the BBC Earth team found a Komodo dragon in their bathroom. A lot of this content includes videos you can watch in Google Earth, without needing to leave the site. The Natural Treasures series, for example, lets you choose environments like “Islands,” “Mountains,” and “Jungles,” to explore. For example, if you choose Mountains, you’ll get a story describing major mountains and the surrounding area. Most of these have accompanying videos you can enjoy. “We’re trying to give viewers that deeper experience,” Chadden Hunter, a producer at the BBC Natural History Unit, told Digital Trends. “With this fully interactive tool, we’re hoping people will just explore for hours.” There’s a lot of content to sift through, as there’s more than a 100 assets from BBC Earth alone. You can check it all out by tapping on the Voyager icon on the left, and clicking on Nature. The view from space Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends You can’t talk about Earth and satellite images without mentioning NASA, a partner with the new Google Earth. The space agency currently has two stories you can explore in Google Earth: “Scenes from Space” and “Reading the ABCs from Space.” The latter involves scrolling through the alphabet with geographical structures that look just like the letters — you’ll also find fun, quirky descriptions with each letter. “Scenes from Space” takes a look at gorgeous landscapes via satellite images, with a description and links to read more about what you’re seeing. To check out NASA Earth Observatory’s content, tap the Voyager icon, and head to Nature. Travel and history Google Earth Google already has Trips, an app you can use to plan your next vacation, but you can use the new Google Earth for this as well. The Travel tab in Voyager offers curated points of interest in major cities around the world, such as Paris, Tokyo, New York City, and more. If you choose to explore Paris, for example, you can find stories like “72 Hours in Paris: Day 1,” where you’ll see multiple points of interest to visit. The History tab seems to be more of an assortment of random stories from the Street View team and some other partners. The list here is small, but you can explore interesting pieces such as “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks,” and “Lost Civilizations from Above.” A surprising Sesame Street tie-in Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Sesame Street is broadcast in more than 150 countries, reaching more than 156 million children around the world. The tie-in here is to provide educational content for children through the Muppets, who act as role models promoting education, good habits, respect, and understanding. The first story from Sesame Street on Google Earth is called “Girls Around the World,” and you’ll find aired content from 12 different co-productions in places such as Afghanistan and India. Tap on a country and children can learn a little about the place, meet the local Muppet, and even see the Muppet interviewing locals. There’s also a lot of content that’s told by kids, for kids. To find Sesame Street in Google Earth, tap on the Voyager icon on the left, tap on Culture, and find Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World. Expect more content to be added often. Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World Tips and tricks Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends There are a few neat tricks in the new Google Earth you should know about. Firstly, if you have a Google Chromecast, you can cast to your TV. On Chrome, find the Cast icon on the top right and share your tab to a nearby Chromecast device. On Android, you’ll need to open the Google Home app, slide out the navigation drawer, and tap on Cast screen/audio.  There’s also a dice icon below Voyager on the sidebar — tap it to trigger “I’m Feeling Lucky,” where Google will take you to a random point in the world. You can bookmark any place you visit, and you can find these saved places in the My Places tab on the sidebar. You can also share a location with just a link. Tap the Share icon in the sidebar and you can either copy the link to your clipboard, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Immerse yourself to the max in VR Got an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive? The Google Earth VR app is now available on both platforms, and it allows you to fly to anywhere in the world. You can take cinematic tours, visit featured places, and even move the position of the sun to transform the place you’re in from day to night. You can grab the app from the Oculus store here, and you can find it on Steam for the HTC Vive. Google told Digital Trends that Voyager content will regularly be updated with partners. The new Google Earth is available on Android and the Google Chrome browser. An iOS version is in the works, and the company is looking to bring the experience to other browsers as well.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares202 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over?

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Must be manufactured by commie pinkos. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seriously, no mention of the blue screen on the LG G6?

I'll really appreciate it. xphyle The hate is strong with this one... Drakenoid The love child of this and OG Moto X would be my perfect phone! Ihavenewnike Have had the phone for the last few hours. The face unlock is crazy fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Excellent! That's what I would use. I'm not worried about someone taking a picture of my face and stealing my phone. Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie.

Rohit KVN   April 23, 2017 10:01 IST [Representational Image]REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson In a welcome move, Search engine giant Google has tweaked YouTube Restricted mode's algorithm to allow of video streaming of mature subjects including LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender), political viewpoints, race, religion orientation and more. "Back in March, our community alerted us that our systems were not working as intended, in particular, that we were unintentionally filtering content from Restricted Mode that shouldn't have been. After a thorough investigation, we started making several improvements to Restricted Mode," YouTube said in a statement. Also read: Google Home now supports 6 different voices; here's how to add new accounts in 4 simple steps The company's engineering have fixed an issue that was incorrectly filtering videos for Restricted Mode.With the change, users can now access to 12 million additional videos of all types -- including hundreds of thousands featuring LGBTQ+ content -- in Restricted Mode. Further, YouTube also laid out the guideline for video content creators, as well. Here are rules you should know before you create YouTube video content: Drugs and alcohol: If you're talking about drug use or abuse, or if you're drinking alcohol in your videos, your videos will likely not be available in Restricted Mode. Sex: While some educational, straightforward conversations about sexual education may be included in Restricted Mode, overly detailed conversations about sex or sexual activity will likely be removed. This is one of the more difficult topics to train our systems on, and the context is key. If your music video features adult themes like sex or drug use, that video will likely not make it into Restricted Mode. Violence: If your video includes graphic descriptions of violence, violent acts, natural disasters and tragedies, or even violence in the news, it will likely not appear in Restricted Mode. Mature subjects: Videos that cover specific details about events related to terrorism, war, crime, and political conflicts that resulted in death or serious injury may not be available on Restricted Mode, even if no graphic imagery is shown. Profane language: Inappropriate language including profanity like "F bombs" will also likely result in your video not being available in Restricted Mode.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Helpless Bixby button on Samsung Galaxy S8 gets remapped to Google Assistant, once again A free app called BixRemap allows users to remap the Bixby button on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Google Assistant without requiring any reboot. Kukil Bora   April 23, 2017 09:30 IST According to the company, Bixby is not just another digital assistant, it's an aide to help users better perform the litany of tasks with their smartphones.Samsung Samsung's recent update to block the ability to remap the Bixby button on the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ couldn't last for long as a developer named Dave Bennett has come up with an app that lets you bypass that blockade. The new app called BixRemap is a simple app that allows you to launch Google Assistant on top of Bixby whenever you press the dedicated Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Once you press the button, you will first see a brief Bixby start up before Google Assistant kicks it out of the way to take over the show. The best thing about BixRemap is that it allows the Bixby button to be remapped without requiring you to reboot the device. All you need to do is install the app, which is now available on the Google Play Store, toggle on one switch to allow it to access Usage Data and hit a big Start Service button. "I was really determined to find a new way to Launch Google now when I pressed the Bixby button. So I threw together a quick app in 20 minutes to do just that. It looks for Bixby in the foreground and launches Google Now on top of it. I can develop it further if there's any interest, right now it's just a basic app," Bennett wrote on Reddit. The Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 can be remapped again, thanks to this free app.Google Play Although the app is not a very elegant solution at this point of time, a more polished version of it is expected soon as Bennett is counting on suggestions from those who have tried his app. Meanwhile, some users on Reddit have suggested Bennett to add a launch on boot option, and also to set the notification priority to the lowest to avoid the persistent icon on the status bar. Bennett said he liked the idea, and is apparently working on it. Following the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, an app called All in One Gestures surfaced online allowing users to remap the exclusive Bixby button to anything they wanted. There was another app called Button Mapper, which could exploit Accessibility Services to intercept the key events generated after pressing the Bixby button, and redirect the system to launch a different app. However, it did not bode well for Samsung, and the company rolled out an OTA updated to remove this functionality. A Samsung executive even took to Twitter to confirm the move. What might have triggered users' lack of interest towards the Bixby button is the fact that Samsung's new AI-based virtual assistant is still a half-baked solution with no support for voice commands. It was one of the most important features the company boasted about while announcing the Galaxy S8. Bixby currently allows consumers to use on-screen features like the 'Vision' camera software, the 'Home' panel of widgets and 'Reminder' while the voice activation capability is not expected to arrive until "later this spring".

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over?

But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

(Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump recently signed a joint congressional resolution that repealed the Federal Communications Commission’s privacy rules. The debate prompted an unusual amount of misleading sturm und drang. Let’s understand what’s really at stake. There is a common misconception that Congress stripped Americans of privacy rights. But consumers have the same rights today that they did before the vote. The joint resolution repealed an FCC order that was not scheduled to take effect until later this year. By repealing these rules, Congress preserved the status quo and consumers should see no difference because the law today is the same as it has been since at least 2015. The purpose of repeal is to restore a level playing field among digital advertisers. Internet-based companies such as Google and Facebook are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulation, which requires companies to notify consumers regarding what information is collected and how it is used, and to allow them to “opt out” of such collection efforts. These rules also governed broadband providers until 2015, when the FCC inadvertently stripped the FTC of jurisdiction when it reclassified them as common carriers. The FCC could have corrected this error by simply applying the FTC rules to broadband providers. But it instead applied a stricter opt-in rule, which prohibited broadband providers from using consumer data unless the consumer gives explicit permission. Importantly, under both regimes, consumers ultimately control how their data is used. The only difference is the default rule: the FTC allows Google to use your data unless you say no, while the FCC would have allowed Verizon to use your data only if you say yes. This is a trivial distinction for consumers — but it would have given Google a tremendous advantage in the battle for internet advertising dollars, a market Google already dominates. Additionally, it is a common misunderstanding that broadband providers know more about you than companies like Google or Facebook. Broadband providers can’t really “see” all traffic — they can only gather information on one’s activities at home, while Google can capture data anywhere a person is logged into a Google account or using a Google operating system. Ultimately, privacy questions cannot be debated in a vacuum. Consumer information is the lifeblood of the internet. Our information is routinely collected by companies, but this is not necessarily problematic. Monetization of consumer data is what helps make Gmail, Facebook, YouTube and other services free — and might someday bring broadband prices down. We cannot debate the value of potential future privacy rules without considering the consequences such rules might have on the broader internet ecosystem.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google, Facebook and Amazon: monopolies that should be broken up or regulated? By Ethan Baron / April 22, 2017 at 5:59 PM At some point, a giant company can cross the line from market dominance to monopoly. Have Google, Facebook and Amazon reached that point? “Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market,” University of Southern California Annenberg Innovation Lab director emeritus Jonathan Taplin wrote in an April 22 op-ed in the New York Times. “In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.” High-profile journalist Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on National Security Agency spying on Americans (revealed in leaks by Edward Snowden) tweeted April 22 that a discussion on the tech firms’ market domination was “way overdue.” “The unrestrained power amassed by the Silicon Valley monopolies is staggering,” Greenwald tweeted. Google, Facebook and Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Taplin’s claims. In Europe, Google for seven years has been facing antitrust allegations from the European Union that the company abused its dominance in search. A decision in the case is expected within months. The Mountain View company this month also agreed to pay Russia a $7.85 million fine and open its Android mobile operating system to rival search engines in the country, after a dispute with Russian competition authorities. Taplin, in his op-ed, argued that Google, Facebook and Amazon “have stymied innovation on a broad scale.” With industry giants facing limited competition, incumbent companies have a profound advantage over new entrants, Taplin said. And the tech firms’ explosive growth has caused massive damage to companies already operating, he said. “The platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent,” Taplin said. The rise of Google and Facebook have diverted billions of dollars from content creators to “owners of monopoly platforms,” he said. “All content creators dependent on advertising must negotiate with Google or Facebook as aggregator. Taplin proposed that for the three tech behemoths, there are “a few obvious regulations to start with.” At minimum, he said, the firms should be barred from buying major firms such as Spotify and Snapchat. “Monopoly is made by acquisition — Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa.” And another possible remedy, with Google, would be to regulate it as a public utility and require it “to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations,” Taplin said. And Taplin took aim at the “safe harbor” provision of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That section of the act protects internet companies from monetary damages when their users and other third parties commit violations against intellectual property. The safe harbor section “allows companies like Facebook and Google’s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others,” he said. Taplin acknowledged that under the administration of President Donald Trump — who has spoken strongly against government regulation and has moved to deregulate industries on a number of fronts — it’s unlikely a priority will be placed on regulating internet firms. “Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up.

A Quick Look At Google's New Messaging App - Messenger Liam Spradlin Follow View All Posts 2014/10/20 10:30am PDTOct 20, 2014 474 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares535 Applications Google Leaks News Ever since we first took a look at Motorola's Nexus 6 (and subsequently saw it leaked and finally announced) there's been a question about that blue and white icon in the dock. We learned directly from Google that it would be a new app called Messenger, that sounds like it will - for all intents and purposes - replace the AOSP messaging app that used to appear on stock devices. But Google didn't give up many details about the app, outside the fact that it would be "specially designed to be a quick and easy way to send and receive SMS and MMS messages on Android," with more information forthcoming. Luckily, we are now able to share a look at the app itself and how it works. Since Messenger isn't actually released yet (the app is still in testing, though a leaked dump has seen it circulated), this will come with the usual disclaimer that anything can change before release time. But what we'll look at below represents the app as it is at the time of writing. First up is the primary screen. It's got a "zen state" message just like Gmail for when your inbox is empty, but when you do have messages you can archive them with a simple swipe to the left or right. Like other instances where contacts appear, those without associated photos are represented by colored circles with the first letter of their name in white.   The interesting thing about these avatars, though, is their influence over the app's theme. If you are talking with someone who has a red circle avatar, your conversation with that person will be themed accordingly. The toolbar will be red, and the incoming word bubbles will be as well. The theming even carries over into that conversation's specific settings and the attach interface.    Speaking of the attach interface, you can attach photos or videos captured on the fly, an image or video from your gallery, or you can send a voice recording.     As you can see in the shots above, the functionality you'd expect is present. Group messages, the ability to search conversations, individual notification control, and more are all present. As for the actual app's settings, they closely mirror the current AOSP messaging app's settings, except in Messenger, the only storage option is to delete old messages "when storage is low." Gone is the option to set a specific limit on how many messages can be kept in a conversation before the old ones begin dropping off.   There don't appear to be many animations at this stage, but that's fine - this is a very basic app that does a few things in a really beautiful way without any extra flair. Users feeling burned by Hangouts' SMS integration will have no problem adapting to yet another means of SMS communication when Messenger is finally released with the new Nexus devices next month.

So far, other than a few minor bugs, it's been really smooth. teh Jax Agreed. There's a very functional ROOT available as well if you flash the custom kernel from Chainfire and load up the correct SuperSU. Even TiBu (with a test release, not the market version) works very well. Qbancelli If it doesn't have Quick Reply popup is dead to me. How hard is it to implement this Google? The 8sms app does this, and a lot more perfectly. Björn Lundén Good thing this app will likely be open source as part of AOSP then, unlike Hangouts so that others can implement that. Amrit Zoad Beautiful! Preston Mueller Should we expect this to be in AOSP? Jovie Brett Bardoles For real. Björn Lundén Yes, almost certainly. That would be the main reason for releasing this I imagine. Nadav THIS SHIT IS GOOD Jovie Brett Bardoles Thought this weird Messaging app is ugly, tho unexpectedly it is beautiful! Raloc I still can't get over the "why" of this. Why don't they just make Hangouts not suck instead of trying to bandage the wound by once again fragmenting their messaging services? Zak Taccardi because not every OEM wants to promote Hangouts as the default messaging service. It's the best solution to a shitty problem. Google should really put this app on the play store though. Victor Souza it's getting replaced by that stock Messenger that comes with Motos and Nexuses, almost certainly it's going to the Play Store Udayan Banerji So again, if OEMs can have a problem with Hangouts, they can have a problem with the stock messaging app as well, and will replace it with their own. At least Hangouts will remain the same on every phone. I agree with Raloc, why not fix Hangouts. I mean what is the excuse, and is it big enough that they will release a whole new app for that? Zak Taccardi Google cannot open source Hangouts. They can open source an SMS app. They need a material SMS app for OEMs to based their development off of. Google has developers working on BOTH of these problems. Just because you prefer hangouts doesn't mean everyone else has to. I personally love Hangouts. But there needs to be a material option for those who do not. Udayan Banerji Hangouts will soon be Material itself, don't you think so? Though I do get your point now, which is that OEMs can use this app as a reference. Thanks! Adonis K. They could make Hangouts an extension/plugin for this Messaging app... Zak Taccardi Hangouts is too advanced for a simple plugin. HoboJerk 1) You don't have to use it 2) It's an AOSP app(probably), so you don't need Gapps, and it's usable in China, etc. 3) You don't have to use it. Udayan Banerji One "why" I can think of is Google's need to get rid of the whole GMail / Google+ connotation of Hangouts. If you ask an average user (the sort who doesn't read Android Police, probably is using his first smartphone), he will not know what Hangouts is, or not understand that it can send SMS. He WILL know Messeging. Of course, very poorly executed by Google. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) what's the problem with hangouts?? Cheeseball It's closed source and currently slow when you have a spotty data connection (due to G+ integration). Disabling data makes it faster, but is a hassle to do that every other time. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Ah, I never knew that. I'm never in a bad connection and no wifi. I guess that can make sense. Cheeseball Hangouts is cool when you have a stable data/WiFi connection, but is complete crap when you have spotty data. This is due to the fact that it has to load anything related to G+ (e.g. profile pictures) when using the app. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) makes sense. thanks for going into more detail. I've asked why several times and all people say is "I hate hangouts" or "hangouts is crap" or "I don't like it because it sucks!" those answers don't help me to understand >_< Cheeseball Exactly. It's not that we hate Hangouts without reason, but because of the features that it lacks or the struggling performance. If it did work as fast as the stock/AOSP SMS/MMS app (regardless of an active internet connection), then I'm sure our complaints would be far less exorbitant. This is also why it gets compared a lot to iMessage on iOS as even on an unstable internet connection, iMessage quickly identifies whether to send a message through SMS or through the built-in iMessage service (blue or green Send button). The only problem is not being able to choose between SMS/iMessage (although I don't know if Apple changed this already). dxppxd This is not fragmenting messaging services, it's the ssms app for AOSP revamped. It's a good thing too, if hangouts replaces sms, then there would be no updated open source solution for a core function of telephony. I like hangouts, it's a good idea to have centralized messaging, but hate the execution. The lag that g+ integration forces on hangouts is enough to make me keep a separate app for sms every time. Arjit Mehra Looks neat! Mathieu M Byebye Hangouts Tom Erlandsen Red, blue AND yellow all on one page? That's too much material for me to handle right now braindead360 I still for the life of me cannot figure out why they do not just make these changes to Hangouts and run with it. ngo93 My thoughts exactly. The point of Hangouts was to unify messaging.. This messenger app, which is beautiful by the way, is a step backwards.. Tiago Pestana I really don't understand why google does this....like other user saying 5 days ago: "How about making Hangouts "a quick and easy way to send and receive SMS and MMS messages on Android" instead of creating more confusion?" cause i really enjoy hangouts, and i dont see any point on doing this Vlad Jurj Because Hangouts is not open sourced. This is the updated AOSP/stock app Björn Lundén Yes. People seem to have a really hard time grasping that important difference. Even if people never end up using it directly (though many likely will) it serves as a good base for OEMs to base their apps on. Clark DeVitis Then I really hope that the make Hangouts SMS/MMS functionality work this well, and make hangouts an even better option than this. Gerjannn If only Hangouts looked this beautiful.. Matches Malone They picked the most hideous shade of green for the latest version. morteum I downloaded the new messaging app. For some reason, it doesn't look as good as the pictures above make it seem. I don't love the hangouts UI, but I don't think this one is exponentially better. RockAndRock Where is the APK ? :P Desislav Iliev ^funny. If you wrote this 6 months ago BarelyBlurred https://plus.google.com/+MatthewBaer/posts/UWukwFB3ddt schoat333 I see a lot of hate for hangout, but I prefer it. Defenestratus For every person who complains about it, there are 10 others who have no problem with it. (Like me) someone755 I actually convinced a lot of people to try it. Now I have 30 people whose Hangouts online status is always on (compared to about a year ago when there were 2 people that occasionally logged onto GMail on their desktop). TheDrizzle The hard part is getting iOS users to use Hangouts. They are tied to iMessage. Lame. Jakob Bjerre Petersen I have actually had the most succes with that particular group of people. :) Paul I've managed to get my iOS-using family members to install Hangouts. But they're not Apple fanatics; they just want something that works. They know where I'm available -- in Hangouts -- so they use it to contact me, while using iMessage to contact each other. someone755 None of the people I talk to uses iOS. So I got that going for me, which is nice. Christopher Prats Everyone I know thinks that android is stupid and believe it has an ugly ui, well I guess they're enjoying their gingerbread era features and believe that android is slightly behind ui wise Christopher Prats They believe it looks like this Val Garcia same here, then i pull my rooted self designed android phone out, summoned ok google without touching the screen and their minds are blown away. seriously iOS's home screen is one of the ugliest interface I've seen another one is touchwiz and that one in your picture above Đức Thành I wouldn't say iOS is ugly as that's mostly subjective (though it kind of is to me, too), but it surely is unintuitive as heck. And that's the case even if we disregard the customization ability and use the device out of the box - maybe with lagwiz and everything, An Android device's still a lot more intuitive than iOS at this point. And that's comparing iOS 7 (I mean, does it matter which version of iOS we're using for comparison? They're all the same.) to friggin' ICS and Jelly Bean! When you put personal customization that fits your own habits into the equation, it's even more of a no brainer. And that's not to mention the glorious Lollipop. ynksbsbll2 I was able to convince my girlfriend to start using Hangouts on her iPhone. Next up: converting her to Android! Bilal Aahil Good luck with that mate XD Cthatguy Get her to use the glory of L - then there will be no turning back! Đức Thành You'd better wait till the official full release of Lollipop and set up everything ready for her to use on the new phone, do it in a way that's similar to her phone-using habits. The trap is set, once you do it right in luring her into getting used to the beautiful new OS, there's no escape. Tip: remember to install a shitload of Material Design Apps for her - as many as you can find, and simply leave it there for her to discover. Don't shove it in her face, do it in a subtle way but make sure they're easy for her to reach... Huehuehue. ...Sorry, somehow I'm getting excited like I'm the one doing the hunting myself. Deftdrummer This is a fucking weird comment on so many levels. Are you OK? Đức Thành I... I didn't know. I was only trying to be helpful.. Lisandro O Oocks iLamessage michael interbartolo I got my dad to use hangouts over normal texting from his iphone. it is good cause even the kids can hangout with papa now on their tablets. Alec Manning I got my grama to use hangouts on her iPad! blindexecutioner Doubtful. If that was the case this app would not be getting released. Michael This app is going into AOSP, which means it is a replacement for the old Messages app. Hangouts is a Google product and is not in AOSP. KG Great point!, I love hangouts as well... Hothfox Thank you, this. It's also why the caller ID function did not go out to any other phones but the Nexus - it was an exclusive feature, not in AOSP. qfv Eh? They killed the AOSP app in KK. The fact that their bringing it back clearly demonstrates that Hangouts sucks balls, for some people anyway. Michael They didn't kill the Messages app in KitKat. Its always been there. In Nexus devices, it isn't there because Nexus devices are not a pure Android experience, Nexus devices are a Pure Google Experience. Hangouts is a Google Experience app and Messages was not. This new app is replaces Messages because they wanted to incorporate Material Design into it so that more people would recognize it. It also gives choice to those that do not want to use Hangouts... But don't be mistaken, Google wants you to use Hangouts. Chroniq Actually, there is a great article on Ars Technica, written by Ron Amadeo, about Google's strategy on making multiple versions of everything. You might wanna check it up, it explains it very accurately: http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/10/googles-product-strategy-make-two-of-everything/ Alex "Doubtful." Well, going on the likes of his comment vs yours (5 vs 81 at the time of this posting), it looks closer to a 16 people to every 1 who complains. qb This site mostly features Google fanboys and Android enthusiasts. It hardly represents most Android users. Besides I agree with him, but I almost never bother voting for anyone's comment. jimv1983 The one thing I don't like about the Hangouts app is that it shows other contacts besides ones I have a mobile number for when I go to create a new message(I only use it for SMS). However, after the first week of using it I am always continuing existing conversations so it doesn't matter. Otherwise I like the Hangouts app. I will check out the new app too and use whenever I like best. lol Thank you for taking the time to yank that statistic out of your ass. Prasad Tiruvalluri I like hangouts and use it as my default messaging app. But I do not see any option to search my messages? Am I missing it or it is not there? Even my default Xperia Z1 messaging app has search option and I sometimes feel like going back to that.. roaduardo For every person who is satisfied with it, there are 10 others who prefer more customization options. That's one of the reasons for being on Android. Choices. Customization. Freedom. Victor Souza it's called "loud criers" I hate Hangouts too though qq Spoken like true Google fanboy. Abraham Williams Hangouts is awesome. It just needs a little more love. josuearisty What hangouts really needs is a better desing (like this messenger app) and make it easier to use (like this messenger app) I would like to filter and dont show my G+ contacts. Jem Ya, seriously. When I'm typing in a contact's name to text or message, I do _not_ want to have to filer through all my G+ contacts too! Ugh. There needs to be an option added where users can choose to include G+ contacts in Hangouts or not when typing in names! ClikFire _ I agree I like the look of this app better. This may Sound like Heresy but I actually think imessage on ios is the best looking sms app. Zep I believe it needs, a whole lotta love. ninjustin While I love hangouts, I still think it has some bugs to be worked out. For starters I don't always receive notifications for my hangouts/sms messages from it. Mastermind26 This. morteum I don't hate hangouts, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Few of my friends use it, so there isn't much of a point for me to use it over any other messenger app. The latest update feels really out of place to me, but the old UI was incredibly drab. It has the potential to be really awesome. They just need to market it more, crack down on OEMs to quit promoting their own shit over it, and give some more attention to the UI and functionality of the app. It should be more than iMessage ever was. It should be the easiest solution to messaging on any device for anyone. Rodrigo Santiago It's funny because many people already have a google account (gmail), and when I send a message through hangouts to some friends, they reaction is "omg wtf is this?" Rodrigo Santiago I agree with you. In hangouts I get an app that I can chat with someone in the phone, send and receive sms in the same conversation with that person, then I can continue that chat in the PC, without the need to install anything, just opening Gmail, but it's awfull? I really don't understand people at all. Of course it has some misbehaves, but, for me, they are minimal. QC With Whatsapp, for example, you can message people without making any account. All you do is install the app, it pulls your contacts from your phone and you can SMS/MMS them instantly, but Hangouts is better? I really don't understand people at all. eric10234 Yes and no. I use both Hangouts and Whatsapp. With Whatsapp, the lack of needing an account is a plus point. However, with Hangouts, any chats that I do on my phone, I can continue on my PC or vice versa. Also, when I switch phones, my Hangouts conversations sync over automatically while with Whatsapp, I would need to manually put in the chat history. So there are pros and cons with both. Rodrigo Santiago Well, if you have an android phone and access to google play store, tada, you have a google account. If you have gmail, tada, you have a google account. It's all you need to use hangouts. No, in WhatsApp you can't send SMS/MMS. You send text messages, it's not the same. No, in WhatsApp you can't chat in the PC without installing anything. Jiggs It is disgustingly laggy. Open whatsapp and open hangouts. The lag in hangouts is quite noticeable. And it is everywhere. When opening the app, sending a message, clicking on video call and call buttons, just everywhere. No wonder it hasn't had any significant adoption. KG Yes, I wish/hope this is fixed in future updates.... Wes A. Haque Looks like the hangouts app lags more when the dialer is installed. I really would like a search option in hangouts. Its 2014 for crying out loud. And where is the material design New Message floating button?? theiowakid This. Why no Search Goog? Why?!?! Peterson Silva As weird as it may sound, Whatsapp is "laggier" for me (is that a word? anyway) - Specially when typing, sometimes the keyboard will just freeze for 5 to 10 seconds. Really weird. But then again, I have an S3 Intl with CM11. Not exactly a flaghsip any longer :) Niall Murray Are you using swiftkey? Peterson Silva Yes! Niall Murray Try change your keyboard. swiftkey causes lag on whatsapp for me as well. Swaminathan Venkatesh This happens to me in my Note 2 & OPO as well.. Frustrating at times.. And I am using Google keyboard.. Matches Malone Probably your phone. WhatsApp never lags on my Nexus 5. hmmm Woah! Whatsapp doesnt lag on my GNex running Paranoid Android KK. There must be something wrong with your phone. Juan o.O whiners gunna whine, bitchers gunna bitch... Thats just how it is! Juan Asshole And assholes gunna asshole? VULGARCITO U mad bro? Need some kleenex to cry on the corner? Miles Reiter I hated it until the most recent update. The UI was always fine, but the UX left a lot to be desired in terms of consistency. brgulker It's missing things about texting that I want. Textra's quick replies and notifications are necessities for my purposes, and Hangouts has neither. It is also extremely laggy at times. I want a unified solution for SMS, MMS and... internet messages (don't know how to abbreviate those), but Hangouts just ain't it yet. Robert Daniels I wouldn't say I hate Hangouts, but SMSing did get a lot more efficient once I stopped using Hangouts for it. mantra2 Same page, this looks nice, but I have no plans to leave Hangouts. Works great and I do much more chatting via Hangouts than I do via SMS. ClikFire _ I like this better personally never really liked hangouts at all. Negative287 Hangouts sucked because it forced the whole ecosystem of Google Plus on you to send a picture in a message. Allo isn't any better in this regard. enoch861 Looks exactly like Textra. IamTheFij Yep. This is why the whole Textra vs. QKSMS controversy was stupid. They are both nothing more than a material themed messaging app. There is pretty much one way to do that if you follow the guidelines. Pavel Sikun WHY DA HELL THEY DON"T MAKE IMESSAGES CLONE ALREADY?? Make an invisible relay - send the message via internet by default and if there's no connection - automatically resend it using sms. Really, Google, stop bitching around, do the thing all users really want! Defenestratus You realize how much iMessage pisses off people who have to chat with people who own iPhones but don't have iPhones themselves? Especially those who have android phones but also iPads that "stay on" during the day on the nightstand? Talk to my buddy Bob who missed a bunch of SMS/iMessages from his sister that his poor mother was sent to the emergency room but because of iMessage, he didn't find out about it until he got home and turned on his iPad to find all of those messages sitting there for him. [email protected] I hate crapple so much. Pavel Sikun They can always make "check delay", so if user haven't checked internet-sent message in like a minute - then system should re-send this message via sms. If they'd want to, they can make it to work logically and correct. brgulker Whatever happened to picking up the phone and making a phone call? I feel bad for your friend. That's awful all around. But sometimes, you just gotta make the phone call. EowynCarter I don't want that. I want my phone to send an sms when I say sms. I usually use sms on purpose, because I expect the receiver to be in a place with no data. digiblur Why oh why do they continue to force these white backgrounds. Blinding to read at night... Danny365 I wonder why they chose to use different looking on/off switch in this app. CoreRooted That's Material Design. Daniel Smith I hope the attachments are sent over Google and not MMS. CoreRooted MMS messages are still sent via your carrier. jpelgrom Why hasn't anyone mentioned the new AP logo yet (watermark in images)? (probably because we've seen it so much already) Pascal Welsch Useless. I don't write SMS. Mlibbey Usless, for you. TAINT_BUTTHOLE That's a real cool story bro. Brandon Jiang And I suppose smartphones are useless, because there are still billions who don't have one? #logic brgulker Much like this comment, then? power_pizza I hate the latest version of Hangouts. The previous version worked great for me. I don't care about google voice but I like using Gchat to sync across my devices. I want to call people from Hangouts using old fashioned phone service but now Hangouts dials my contacts using Google Voice without giving me the option to change it back. Boo. jscofi when you are in a chat with someone, and you click the phone icon, it pops up prompting you to call the person(using gvoice). However, if you tap the Normal looking phone next to the Hangouts icon, it dials the number from your SIM phone # trwnh Not everyone loves Hangouts integration. My mom absolutely CANNOT function with having her SMS in Hangouts. She needs it to be separate, so she always knows 100% where a message is being sent from. She doesn't ever want to send a message to Hangouts when she meant to text, and she doesn't ever want to use texts with international numbers unless she wants to, and typing someone's name opens Hangouts by default, which she doesn't like. Cesar I love how it changes theme color depending on the avatar of the person in the conversation. I wonder how it handles someone you actually do have a picture for though. Victor Souza just like Contacts, it choses a color automatically based on the person's pic there's orange, pink, gray, blue and green Leeroy Jenkins Someone on Google+ commented that, because Google wants to sell the Nexus 6 through US carriers, they required a standart SMS app. As carriers want to promote their own texting plans and not promote people to use Hangouts, Whats app etc. This sound very likely to me. Artmem replied something along the lines of "never underestimate the carriers greed to make money". Does that make sense? gab_gagnon Apple can easily push iMessage into carrier's throats. Why can't Google do the same? Zak Taccardi iMessage is easy to implement because they only care about supporting it for iOS devices, which all run the same software. The logic is this: "If user sends message to other iOS user, use iMessage instead of SMS" - remember with iMessage, both users are using the Apple messaging app. In Android it's not so simple. Apple can do what they want because if the carriers have a problem with it, Apple won't offer their phone on their service. If Google doesn't do what Verizon wants, their is plenty of other Android competition out there that Verizon doesn't need to cater to Google. gab_gagnon Thanks for the clear and respectful answer! braindead360 Apple holds about 42% of the smartphone market. While Androids market share is higher, you have to remember that this is a result of dozens of devices being sold by different companies, leaving several weak points for negotiation. If the carriers decided to play dirty and force the OEM's hands, they could put pressure on them to fork Android into their (the carriers') own visions of how smartphones should operate. Spoilers, we don't want that. I doubt they would do something like that over something as petty as messaging, but then again, they've arguably done stupider things. morteum Probably because of the sheer popularity and power of the iPhone. The Nexus line is awesome to some, but has never been a huge hit compared to the iPhone. If Google wanted to ensure the Nexus 6 was on all carriers they probably had to make a few compromises. A carrier can get away with not carrying the Nexus 6 easily. The iPhone, on the other hand, would be hard to pass up. Fatal1ty_93_RUS $$$$ <--- this is why braindead360 That makes sense to some extent, but I still think it is ridiculous. Data is the new cash cow on the block, and I would think that anything they could do to get people to use more of it, hence need to buy more of it, would be optimal towards maximizing profits. Hell, I would imagine that nearly everyone, outside of a handful of people clutching on to their unlimited plans have unlimited messaging grouped into their plans. brgulker User experience still matters. When I was out of town for a week in a place with spotty data connections, I had no idea why Hangouts was acting up so much (I was using it for SMS at the time as well). Only after the fact did I learn how heavily Hangouts relies on data even when you don't think you "need" it, e.g., to send a text. blindexecutioner These third parties should stop blaming carriers for everything "evil" Google does. Leeroy Jenkins Sure, I agree, It's just a thesis of what's going on, the true reason, only Mountain-view knows. Leonardo Baez Lots of sense... Miguel Vega Well I think is time for Google to start imposing itself and it policies like Apple do. You dont need any freaking carriers approval when they update or when they add any other features. The carriers have to adapt to Apple not the other way around. I am an android fan just in case btw. brgulker But Google can't do this. They just don't have the leverage Apple does. Miguel Vega Well Apple net worth is about 286 billion and Google 328 billion approximate. 51.5% of all phones sales in the us are android 42.8% Iphones also Google is the most widely used search engine. I think they have about or more leverage if they want to impose themselves. I think they just dont care. Prosper Bluff Check a couple posts up.. Someone explains this: (Here, let me quote) "Apple can do what they want because if the carriers have a problem with it, Apple won't offer their phone on their service. If Google doesn't do what Verizon wants, their is plenty of other Android competition out there that Verizon doesn't need to cater to Google." Thats the gist of it.. The carriers don't care about your company's worth and such.. Just how much money they can make off of, or without you :/ ThoFeelExp That context specific colour adaptability is futuristic Walkop The Contacts app on Lollipop has it too, AP hasn't covered that yet. perhac88 Tried it earlier on my Nexus 5 (stock). Love the way it looks, but after every text I sent the keyboard would freeze for about 3 seconds Alijah Simon Need I remind you fine fuckers that Google has Material planned for all its apps? Here's Google's own rendition of Hangouts back from IO (next to the pantyhose-grey version): Here's to Material Design. *Clink* Brayjr No pic? Cesar Refresh. Brayjr Ah... Fatal1ty_93_RUS Looks quite shitty honestly, I hope final version will be completely different from this spacemonkey82 this is the reason why an average user find android confusing - why the hell introduce messenger when hangouts works perfectly fine. TAINT_BUTTHOLE To reduce confusion, obviously. Leonardo Baez Because it dont work perfectly for everyone. Most oldest users find it confusing. Blake Choice doesn't need to be confusing. brgulker My experience was exactly the other way around. I tried to explain that Hangouts was an internet based service that could incorporate blank stares to my parents and in laws, and I got blank stares back. So, we they just keep using SMS, and they are not confused at all. SMS works just fine for most people. Marcel Ulbrich That might be the case in the US, over here, SMS are expensive, every single text would cost me 20cents, MMS would start at about 80cents with crappy 30kb pictures, which is why SMS died about 2-3 years ago and MMS were a non-starter for most. People have been used to resorting to Internet messaging back in the ICQ days and don't have to put up with the carriers' ridiculous charges. Nwarrior Look at the colors used in this app. The touchwiz preview looked a lot better than these colors, yet the fanboys went wild. Dear god those are ugly color combinations. Dr. Giygas Devereaux If they didn't update the AOSP messaging app, there would be people complaining about Google abandoning open source. But now that they did, apparently that means they're ignoring/abandoning Hangouts. Damned if they do, damned if they don't. person You know that there are many people and they have differing opinions, right? rmkilc What is the star in the status bar?? TAINT_BUTTHOLE Indicator for Android Starburst. rmkilc Seems legit. TAINT_BUTTHOLE Totally. Kehnin Dyer Priority notification mode is active. Oliver Phillips It signifies you are in 'Priority mode', which you can select from the volume overlay in Lollipop. It only lets certain notifications through for a set amount of time: http://imgur.com/h7CRVln deepak Pls pls pls add an easy way to share contacts! nathanielbaratta I understand that not everyone uses hangouts, but for the most part people that get a nexus phone use it. I, personally, will continue to use hangouts for all messaging when I get my N6, hopefully hangouts gets a nice material update and still supports the integration of texts. Leonardo Baez You will have the 2 apps and you can choose wich one will be the default... Isnt that great? sch31 Looks great but they should really starting encrypting messages. I have a feeling I'll have to wait a long time for that feature. Always textsecure tho :) blindexecutioner Can you customize which color the contact circles are? I'd absolutely hate my wife getting red assigned to her. Very few of my contacts use real pictures. Leonardo Baez You must add the picture in your contact entry Oliver Phillips I think this is the AOSP app Pororo APK? https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0ImwqTxo-neN3RYTU8weG1CN1k/view blindexecutioner Off topic but what's the star next to the wifi icon? Pororo Priority notification. Press your volume button. u will know what i mean. ^^ The Dude So instead of standardizing on Hangouts, Google creates more fragmentation, more confusion. Just make Hangouts the default on every phone! I already have a hard time convincing people to use it because its not the default messaging app. Minhaj Tahsin Ahmed So what color it inherits when the contact has a picture? RahjerDat I think it depends on whether or not they have Hangouts. My girl texted me and the color was green. My friend texted me from an iPhone and the color was blue. They both have pics. Oliver Phillips I think it's based on the predominant colour in the picture. My (redheaded) sister shows up as quite a bright orange Mastermind26 Seems an awful lot like textra layout....or is it the other way around???? Yury Andratsion Messenger? YouNex Apk https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Q9z2mAd85kdUZheC05SHZxT0E/preview Blayze04 I don't understand why Google hasn't implemented in this or Hangouts a why to quick reply to messages from the notification area. Fatal1ty_93_RUS This is what hangouts should have fucking been since the beggining instead of that rushed POS we have now LUIS FLORES This actually looks a lot like textra Swaginator Uh, Textra anyone? Bigzitta They need to add contact sharing in this app yungqb7 I hope that all of this gets implemented in the next major revision of hangouts kishan I don't understand. Why can't they just improve on Hangouts instead of creating another freaking app? Fatal1ty_93_RUS Because google miri Some people don't like, or find it confusing to use the Hangouts app for regular text messages. Rage4Order While I like Hangouts, I think Google just generally went wrong with it. Instead of making Hangouts a separate messaging application which also handles SMS/MMS, they should have made the default messaging app modular, where Hangouts could function as a plug-in. I.e.potentially make it work exactly the same way that the new Hangouts dialer adds itself into the Hangouts app, but make the whole Hangouts app a module of a unified stock Android messaging app. That way, a user could use a single messaging app to handle all their messaging/video calling needs, but it would not be forcing Hangouts onto those who don't want to use it. With some clever programming, they could even make it intertwine the SMS and Hangout messages the same way iMessage does on iPhone. The current solution on Nexus 5 is confusing and not exactly intuitive, because you have to go into Hangouts to send a non-hangouts message. That's just a bad design idea. Yan Gabriel Minário See, Google? Make it happen. brgulker Not a developer, so no idea if this is doable, but this sure makes sense. Majeed Hamid My question is, is google trying to implement whatsapp like here? if so , then looked a good start to me lol brgulker like Gmail for when your inbox is empty, Yep, never had an empty Gmail inbox. brgulker Looks a lot like Textra. Dagmar Schneitz What do you expect? There's a lot of hate many places online. Lars Jeppesen "Messenger" ?? really? Didn't Mickeysoft use the same name for their chat client?? I remember using MS Messenger for a lot of time.. back in the days everybody and their girlfriend were on dat shite... Scott C Would love if it backed up sms to google and auto downloaded to a new phone. How hard is this to implement. Phantom Why are thenav bars black? they look bad, they should be tinted like the notification bar. duse I love how it includes a search function and Hangouts never has since day one. And now every change/improvement they want to make to the SMS experience needs to be done in two apps (or, more likely, in just one app and the other will be left to rot). They can't get anything right. aouniat Why not update hangouts with new features such as voice clips in stead of releasing a new app ? !!!! Michael Jones I'm sure some people will love this but I still prefer hangouts to this. One app to do hangouts and SMS is great for people like me who don't like having a million apps. I already have to use several chat apps because so many friends either use facebook messenger, whatsapp, snapchat, etc, so any way to reduce the number of apps and retain same functionality is great. This will probably be removed by me via TI backup Bilal Aahil I kinda like this app, very simple, Hangouts have its own functionality but this should do just fine for the basic use. Tony Hope MMS will actually send on this. Have so many problems with MMS and Android. aSquard MMS sends for me with the Messenger app as well as hangouts (LPX13D) Toinou Tried it, not bad. I'll keep using Textra though, it's better. Deeco I. Just. Don't. Understand! James Keleman Does anyone have a link or can post the apk? I tried downloading from Google drive and it says there is an error and can't download. Someone help! qbix I can't understand why "strip unicode" is not a default feature. I guess I'll have to wait until Cyanogen fixes that. hyperbolic This is really confusing. What happens with Hangouts ? is it staying ? or perhaps they both stay ? Confusing... les02jen17 No dual-sim support? Come on, Google! Alfisti I feel something has been missed here. Why can't we have a messaging/phone app that integrates all communication ie. Phone calls, txts, email with the addition of integrating messaging apps like whatsapp, viber etc. So you would have all communication threads essentially in one place. That really would be incredible Simon Belmont I have to say that I'd love for Hangouts to adopt the dynamic coloring scheme. That's really neat. Secondly, why does this messaging app have the ability to record sound and send it, but Hangouts STILL can't? I've been resorting to taking videos with no video (just audio) to send sounds to friends. Finally, I'd love to be able to quickly reply to a text right from the notification at the top of the screen. I'm sure Google could pull this off. blah yes, i can't believe i can't send audio clips in hangouts. Guest Hangouts is alright, i would prefer something more like this. ClikFire _ So can you use this instead of Hangouts as your Default SMS? Andy J The question is - is it a Wear friendly app? Jose Romero Don't like the yellow FAB. Jacqui I love hangouts too. Use it as my default SMS app. Only one complaint, before the last update you could swipe a conversation to archive it. Doesn't seem to work anymore. Only way I see to archive is in the conversation. Guillaum Gibault Ok, recently I just convinced some people to use Hangouts as sms app because of its versatility (mobile, pc, mac, tablet, video chat, etc.), and now Google bring a brand new sms app that seems more integrated and polish for Lollipop and promote it more than Hangouts itself. So confused... Dan Caseley Glad I'm not the only one using hangouts. I'm confused by all the hate. Anyone explain the issues with the app? Guillaum Gibault Google should put all their efforts on Hangouts instead refreshing the other SMS app which seemed dead for months. thisphuckinguy I wonder if this will be only available on the N6. baifern it kinda lags when scrolling through list of contacts thisorthat27 Maybe u can tap the delete old messages area and choose when and how they get deleted jdrch Don't see anything that would make me leave mySMS. Walter Black The fact that I won't be getting the android L update till like APRIL or later and it releases in November is one of the main reasons I'm getting an IPhone 6 in two weeks. Salut' 👋 gnaLor Google should rename and redesign the hangouts app into exactly this one, but keep all features (video chat, desktop app, sms), and offer it on iOS (like already) and also Windows Phone. A google+ account should not be mandatory, a normal google account is enough. This way, they will make it as or even more powerfull as the very good facebook messenger, but without the need of facebook (which some dont like) and already preinstalled on all androids. And actually people will be easy to convince since it's preinstalled and already in use as their sms app. bjmy Hoooray! Messaging is back. Now I can uninstall my third party app, along with with shitty Hangouts. Woo Have all the Hangouts fans considered the fact that many people dont want a "unified" solution? I dont use Google+ or GTalk, so those are useless to me. I dont live in the US, so Google Voice is useless to me. That leaves me with SMS/MMS. And I'm happy to finally have an app that lets me do just that. Kahroo Would be cool if I could use my GVoice number with this app. Khan Ermmm, please change those colours, PLEASE! YELLOW RED AND BLUE?? Stuff that sh!t! Clark DeVitis Will Hangouts get lots of sweet features like this app? (the voice memos and stuff) Steven Webb Am I missing something? What's wrong with hangouts? It has full SMS integration. If you don't want to use hangouts messaging, you don't have to. kaiz charaniya It looks a lot like Textra which android users already have access to meelyg there's a simple problem with this & almost every google app. zero customizability. these apps have virtually no settings to customize appearance which is a real shame TEKNISK FEIL How can I make messenger my default notifications app? Tried where it says make default, disabled samsung's messages, but Hangout, that I use for calls, keep stealing focus, and I have to set messenger as default every day. Works perfectly when open, writing back and forth. But still on incomming sms, when messenger is not in use, Hangouts pops up in notifications, I forget, touch it, and there I am, back in Hangouts. quitquit Anyone notice that there are no quick reply/delete/read options in the notification for messenger? No expandable notification? Deal-breaker for me. Chris Any ideas why my contact pictures from Facebook won't show up in the app? I just get the letter of their first name... kristijan Any solution to this? Still trying to figure it out. Ryan Patrick McAvoy This app STILL has a million problems with downloading group messages >_> eddie I love it.... But how to get notifications on my gear s?!

This is even as Truecaller and Google  come together to improve video calling for millions. The strategic agreement  is expected to integrate Google Duo, a high quality video calling service, within the Truecaller app. This will add a crucial communications layer that strengthens the value of Truecaller’s wildly popular dialer, caller ID, and spam blocking app already used by more than 250 million users globally. Along with news of this integration, Truecaller announced a completely new redesign of the Android app, and now with a broader array of useful features including: * SMS: Instantly see who’s SMS’ing you and filter out all spam messages. * Flash Messaging: which allows you to send quick pre-defined messages to any Truecaller user to let them know if you’re in distress, you’re on your way, your location, or that you’ve reached home. “From the very beginning we have worked relentlessly to build a product that helps simplify communications for consumers across the globe, and help them address important needs such knowing the identity of those calling, and blocking unwanted numbers. With valuable partners like Google, we are excited to take the next step in our journey, bringing all your mobile communications under one roof and giving you the safest, most efficient, and most convenient experience possible without having to switch back and forth,”  Nami Zarringhalam, Co-founder and CSO of Truecaller, said, adding that. “Video calling should work for everybody, regardless of what platform they are on. Our aim is to make video calling simple, fast, and available to everyone,” said Amit Fulay, Head of Duo at Google. “With this Truecaller integration, we’re able to bring a better video calling experience to millions of new users.” The new look and feel of Truecaller is consistent with its ongoing commitment to provide a safe and efficient experience for millions of mobile users who’ve become increasingly frustrated by the growing problem of spam calls and texts from unknown users. Now as one of the fastest growing mobile apps in the world, Truecaller sits at the center of your mobile phone experience helping you connect with the people who matter, in the way you want to communicate, while avoiding calls and texts from those you don’t. Google Duo is a simple video calling app that takes the complexity out of video calling. The service has been built to be fast and reliable, with a single button push for connecting with other users. Truecaller integration with Google Duo will be available in the coming months for Android and iOS as a permission-based service, where users will be able to opt-in and out at any time. People use Truecaller to stay ahead. It helps them know who’s getting in touch, filter out unwanted and focus on what really matters. The company provides a suite of unique services such as a dialer that offers caller ID, spam detection, messaging and more. Truecaller’s mission is to build trust everywhere by making communication safe and efficient.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png LineOS for exynos!

Review: Gamemaker 2 Why Understanding Food Serving Sizes Is Important For Weight Loss 5 Uses For Gmail Beyond Sending Boring Old Regular Emails David Nield Apr 23, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  email gmail google Share Even if you don't personally use Gmail, someone you know does. The service is perfect for people who need an email address independent of their work one, and a far better alternative than security nightmares like YahooMail. Yet Gmail, despite the name, isn't just a great platform for email. Image: Alex Knight/Unsplash/Google Gmail makes use of the cloud, just like Dropbox or Google Drive, to store all your emails. Only you have a lot more space in Gmail than you would in a traditional cloud storage drive. That means that with a little ingenuity you can use Gmail for a whole host of other tasks. 1) Taking notes Image: Screenshot All hail the drafts folder (or label), that purgatorial part of Gmail where emails aren't sent but just left in limbo...for eternity. This is a great place to jot down snippets, thoughts, to do lists, ideas, and anything else you want to make a note of temporarily. Remember that you can get at your drafts from anywhere you've got Gmail installed, so your notes go with you everywhere, and of course you've got Gmail's advanced search features to take advantage of too. You can even attach files to your drafts as well. 2) Sending your files to the cloud Image: Screenshot Gmail works wonderfully well with IFTTT (If This Then That), a platform we've talked about many times before, and one way you can utilise this is by having Gmail attachments automatically saved to your Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or Box accounts. Why would you do this via Gmail? It lets you upload files from anywhere you can send an email (like someone else's computer) without installing any other apps, and it also means you can save files to multiple connected cloud services at the same time. 3) Updating all your social media accounts at once Image: Screenshot This is another IFTTT one and a bit of a cheat, because it works with any email service, not just Gmail. If you send an message to a specified IFTTT address, you can post an update to all your social media accounts at once, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others. As you can get at email pretty much everywhere, you can update your social media accounts from everywhere, and there's even the option to upload pictures via email attachments. The posts will use your default privacy settings when they hit Facebook. 4) Making a private photo album Image: Screenshot Google makes it fairly easy for users to have multiple Gmail accounts, so you can set up a dedicated Gmail space for a private photo collection that only a few people have access to. The obvious use is a closed off album of baby pictures for interested friends and family. Anyone can then email over photos to the shared account, with custom labels and subject headers available to organise everything. Some of Gmail's potential for photo storage has been negated by the arrival of Google Photos, but it's still a nice alternative. 5) Keeping a diary Image: Screenshot Gmail isn't the most advanced word processor in the world, but it does have a few features in its favour, like text formatting, support for embedded images, and the various apps that let you access your account from just about any device, from iPhones to Chromebooks. It's also particularly handy for keeping a diary, because you can create new entries with new emails, and organise everything in conversation threads and through Gmail's labelling system. Your diary entries can be easily searched and printed out as well. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

I have been (ab)using the draft feature for ages, its really useful for all sorts of things, I have a few hundred things in there at the moment. I also email myself documents and photos all the time with keywords in them so I can search my mail for them if i need them later. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   4 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. 04/18/2017 PC Reply Question, how is the S PEN lag? Earlier reviewers were sent a Chromebook Pro from Samsung and many commented that there was a noticeable lag between the ink appearing and your writing. Also how low can you turn down the brightness as I like to do writing at night in a low light. I was considering the Lenovo Yoga Book, because of the feature of using real ink and paper on top of the HALO surface area. 04/22/2017 Gary Reply Don’t expect Apple Pencil level latency performance. There is noticeable lag, so you will have to compensate and write slower/carefully for your writings to appear as they would on actual paper. It also depends on the software of course, but I would say the level of lag is about same as Surface Pens. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Still, there is one specific market niche, where Google's brainchild really reigns supreme. And a pretty important and prospective one at that. At the end of last year, Chromebooks comprised a whopping 49% of the K-12 education sector, up from 40% in 2015 and only 9% in 2013. Clearly the web giant is on to something and is seems Redmond wants in. Windows Central recently obtained some insider information, hinting that Microsoft's upcoming May 2 event, will see the release of a new cloud-based variant of Windows 10. One designed specifically to take Chrome OS head on in the classroom. Rumors suggest it will go by the name "Windows 10 S" and that it is thankfully a lot closer to Microsoft's current Universal Windows Platform apps and advanced cloud services, than the company's last misguided attempts at budgets ARM-based solutions - the dreaded Windows RT. Judging by the minimum specs sheet, as well as some additional leaked info, Windows 10 S indeed appears to be intended for standard x86 PC hardware and should run on the unified Windows 10 kernel. This theory is further backed up by the fact that it is said to offer an upgrade path to Windows 10 Home or Pro, through the purchase of an additional license. Microsoft's game plan here will be to offload a lot of tasks from the machine on to the cloud, just like Google does with its Chrome OS. This shouldn't be hard either, since Microsoft's lineup of cloud services, like OneDrive and Office 365 have really come a long way. If Redmond plays its cards right, it could benefit from the long-standing Windows compatibility and versatility arguments as well. Not only is Win32 compatibility for regular desktop applications possible with this approach, but the company's ongoing push towards the UWP model has created tools like Desktop Bridge, or "Project Centennial", for easy migration and running of older code in Microsoft's new ecosystem. And if the US giant is at all serious in its plans to take on Chrome OS in the K-12 realm, this push towards the more streamlined and manageable UWP format needs to become even harder. One of the main reasons Google has been so successful and popular for the particular K-12 use case has always been simplicity to both operate and manage Chrome OS with ease. Teachers, professors and other educators and IT support staff benefit just as much from having a user-friendly experience on the administrative end of the ecosystem. Remote lockups and assistance, strict content control, seamless data transfer are all things Microsoft needs to personally supervise under the UWP flag, so Windows S doesn't get drowned in the sea that is traditional Widows support. But, we digress. Circling back to the May 2 event, some industry insiders hope to see interesting K-12 hardware offers on stage as well. Most speculations seem to revolve around a cheaper laptop-style device, with a non-detachable keyboard, economical enough to make and sell in mass. Still, just like a Surface tablet, it will most likely have a touch screen and perhaps even a stylus. Also, a Lenovo Youga-style hinge setup to properly utilize touch input. Still, others believe Microsoft will hold off on any potential hardware announcements until its Build conference, the following week. Even if that doesn't come to pass and Microsoft decides to rely on third-party compatible hardware offers instead of ones under its own Surface brand, Windows 10 S still holds a lot of potential.

Reply Claudiu.Lucian Lid5 23 hours ago This will motivate Google to work harder on Chrome OS, maybe the Andromeda OS idea will be a thing this year.

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos. Kevin Brown Top 10 of many services Google has killed, and told customers to go eat shit and die. http://lifehacker.com/top-10-services-google-killed-off-1792897076 Andy The expiration made it pretty meaningless to me anyway.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away.

Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it. I am so stoked on that one. hehehe Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 24 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $136.99 ($163 off) from eBay 2017/04/23 12:36pm PDTApr 23, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Get a refurbished UE MEGABOOM for just $129.99 at Best Buy ($170 off MSRP) 2017/04/23 12:09pm PDTApr 23, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Railways is putting together a strategy to launch two lakh screens across India, aiming at a revenue Rs 10,000 crore in 10 years, the Times of India reported, for which a tender could be awarded by May this year. Indiantelevision.com had earlier reported that content on demand on trains and at stations is a sizeable market. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the infotainment market to be around Rs 2,277 crore in three years’ time. The Railway Ministry, in a bid to revamp railways, may invite bids for Content on Demand (CoD) and railradio services in April. Services that would be included under the CoD initiative are -- movies, TVserials, short videos, kids’ shows and devotional content. The CoD would also include streaming audio such as regional songs, movie songs, and devotional music; and providing electronic newspapers, gaming and educational content. Railways' bids for app-based cab services will also be invited by May. The video, radio, digital music and digital gaming contracts will be for a period of 10 years. The railways is, through these initiatives, expecting revenue of Rs 16,000-20,000 crore in 10 years. As per the BCG report, to provide offline content, railways may have to shell out Rs 38,000 per coach. But, the online content will be expensive -- for Rs 25 lakh each. Coaches are required to be well equipped to offer content streamed via the internet.

USA TODAY 0:46 UP NEXT SAN FRANCISCO — So here's just how fast technology is accelerating. We haven't even nailed down self-driving cars yet, and now the buzz is all about flying cars. In fact, the dogged pursuit of an airborne escape from traffic has been with us for more than half a century, from the limited-edition Aerocar of the 1950s to the host of contemporary companies now taking pre-orders for their airborne vehicles. Dutch startup PAL-V announced last week that it was taking $10,000 deposits for its $400,000-and-up two seat Liberty flying car, while Slovakia-based AeroMobil began doing the same for its $1 million-plus machine due out in three years. Both models would require a runway and a pilot's license.  Other big players include Massachusetts-based Terrafugia, whose XF-T looks like a car with wings folded by its sides and, notably, can take off and land vertically, using so-called VTOL technology. The company's site claims flying an XF-T won't require a full pilot's license.  That's the same approach taken by Germany's Lilium Aviation, which just conducted a successful unmanned test flight of its VTOL craft with wheels. And ride-hailing giant Uber, whose ambitious push into self-driving cars is entangled in a lawsuit from rival Google, also envisions a world where your Uber ride can skip the downtown gridlock by taking to the skies. On Tuesday, Uber will host an Elevate conference in Dallas on that idea. From the looks of these big technological leaps, it would appear that hopping a flight to the office is but a few years away. Time to sell the car and buy a parachute. © Provided by USA Today Throttle it back a bit, industry experts say. "Generally speaking, technology is outstripping not just existing regulations, but the speed with which government regulators can rule on new regulations that ensure new technology is safe and organized," says Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Cox Automotive, which includes Kelley Blue Book.  Brauer points out that the Department of Transportation is still trying to iron out rules for autonomous car companies, "and now you'd have a machine that operates in yet another dimension of space. There are just regulations questions all over the place." The Federal Aviation Administration says it is discussing certification options with some flying car manufacturers, with the agreement that initially pilots would be at the helm of such craft. Dick Knapinski, spokesperson for the Experimental Aircraft Association, says "there's no question that 25 years ago, we didn't have the technology to consider any of this. But considering we're still trying to figure out how drones should use air space, having cars flying around could take a while." Tesla's route Engineering a flying car is easier today than its every been, thanks to considerable advancements in lightweight materials, electrical power generation and computer-assisted design that doesn't risk lives with live trials.  © Provided by USA Today What's more, where dedicated hobbyists once made up the bulk of those trying to fashion a machine that could seamlessly transition from concrete to the clouds, today some of the smartest and wealthiest individuals on earth are on the hunt. Larry Page, co-founder of Google, has personally invested in two secretive flying car companies, ZeeAero and Kitty Hawk.  Much like with self-driving cars, actually creating a dual-purpose flying car is more likely a matter of when than if.  When it comes to overcoming regulatory obstacles, flying car startups may be taking their cues from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who bulldozed his way into the automotive manufacturing business. While Tesla's profitability remains a concern for investors, there's no question that Musk has made a name for himself and his sleek electric sedans while causing many consumers to reevaluate electric vehicles. Similarly, flying car companies may also be taking an if-you-build-it-they-will-buy-it approach, banking on public demand pushing lawmakers to pave the way for the new transportation. Terrafugia, Zee.Aero and others did not respond to a request for comment. For the moment, the FAA is taking a "flexible, risk-based approach" to evaluating this evolving tech, especially when it comes to machines that would not require drivers to be pilots and instead fly themselves. "Autonomous passenger air car concepts are still in their early stages (and) several areas need further research," including the aircraft's operational risks and its ability to interact with air traffic control, the FAA said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. As for consumer's embracing this new form of travel, given how long this almost cartoon-ish vision (think The Jetsons) has tantalized us, it would stand to reason that everyone would be on board. © Valery Hache, AFP/Getty Images The Aeromobil, a flying supercar, is on display as part of the "Top Marques" show, dedicated to exclusive luxury goods, in Monaco April 20, 2017. But a recent survey by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute suggests that such excitement is tempered by real concerns. After all, a fender bender on the ground is already a hassle; an airborne one could be a disaster for those above and below. According to UMTRI's survey, while 75% cited shorter travel times as a reason for being interested in the tech, 62% said they "very concerned" about the overall safety of flying cars, with more than half troubled at the prospect of being in such craft in poor weather or at night. More than 60% were moderately or very concerned about the skills required to fly the vehicle, which is perhaps why VTOL machines that are fully automated have the greatest chance of gaining mass acceptance from commuters. Last fall, Uber published a white paper that suggested the ride-hailing giant, which is in the middle of a series of cultural crises, was going to seriously pursue not just autonomous cars but also self-flying VTOL aircraft. The paper sketched out a future filled with on-demand air transportation that would shorten a two-hour San Jose to San Francisco drive to a 15-minute VTOL breeze.  "We believe in the long term, VTOL will be even less expensive than owning a car," the paper notes, citing high demand that would trigger high production and lower vehicle costs. On the flip side, hurdles acknowledged in the Uber document include certification by U.S. and European agencies that regulate the skies, further improvement in battery technology that would keep the craft light and flying for longer periods, and reliability issues when considering a craft that must repeatedly collect passengers with gentle landings but also get them places at up to 200 mph. In the meantime, the high-tech tinkering continues in workshops around the world, driven as much by innovation as by the simple desire to get out of earth-bound gridlock. "Everyone's had the same dream," says Brauer. "You're stuck in traffic, and you imagine yourself simply flying away." Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.

Born on 24 April 1929, Rajkumar, is fondly remembered as Nata Saarvabhouma (Emperor of Actors), Bangarada Manushya (Man of Gold), Vara Nata (Gifted Actor) and Rajanna (Brother Raj) amid the Kannada community and remains an iconic superstar from his time. He passed away at the age of 77 in April 2006. He died of cardiac arrest at his Bengaluru home. Google doodle celebrating 88th birthday of Karnataka superstar Rajkumar A three time national award winner, Rajkumar was also an avid Carnatic musician and singer. In a career spanning over 40 years, the veteran actor has worked in over 200 films and has given many memorable onscreen perfomances. Shabdavedhi (2000) was the last film of the noted actor. Rajkumar started his career with his father in a troupe led by noted Gubbi Veeranna in theater, and started his film career with HLN Simha's Bedara Kannappa. Popular Bollywood actress Rekha also made her debut with him in the film Operation Jackpotnalli CID 999. He is also the first Indian actor to have worked in the Indian rendition of popular  James Bond in Jedara Bale.  The reverence for the veteran actor was such, that Karnataka saw a situation of near political turmoil when Rajkumar was abducted by sandal smuggler, Veerappan in 2000, who was trying to negotiate the release of some of his men apprehended by authorities. Rajkumar was released after 108 days. #Bengaluru#Google#Jedara bale#Kannada films#Karnataka#Newstracker#Rajanna#Rajkumar#Shabdavedhi Published Date: Apr 24, 2017 09:11 am | Updated Date: Apr 24, 2017 10:04 am Also See NGT ruling on Bellandur Lake: Election in 2018 puts ruling Congress under greater pressure Bypoll wins: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah should keep his promises to voters before state election Bypolls 2017: Srinagar records poor turnout at 6.5% as violence kills 7; clashes reported in MP as well T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 Apr 24 MI Vs RPS 2 Apr 25 RCB Vs SRH 3 Apr 26 RPS Vs KKR 4 Apr 27 RCB Vs GL 5 Apr 28 KKR Vs DD Full Schedule Top Stories Tamil Nadu farmers call off protest, serving a grim reminder of how far removed state has become from India Equal Citizens of India: Kashmiri Students Recount Threats and Attacks Mehbooba Mufti meets Narendra Modi, tells Centre should adopt Vajypayee's approach to Kashmir France Presidential Elections 2017: Emmanuel Macron pips Marine Le Pen in round one; run-off on 7 May Ways to make money in a rising market Rajinikanth to play Sultan Mirza in Pa Ranjith's gangster flick opposite Vidya Balan?

It was about a young nurse, possibly a student, who took a job as a home nurse for a little girl who had burns on her legs. I can't believe I couldn't answer this question with Google, but either my search terms aren't descriptive enough, the book is really obscure, or I'm remembering it totally wrong. The girl was maybe living with an uncle who was shady and turns out to have kidnapped the girl? Maybe? So there was a mystery element as well as the SASSY YOUNG CAREER WOMEN angle. I'm guessing the book was written in the 1950s or 60s. I also vaguely remember that it was part of a series about sisters or friends who were nurses. (My school library didn't have any of the other books and I was disappointed.) One of the nurses might have been named Tracey, the little girl MIGHT have been Linda. The book was NOT Cherry Ames or Sue Barton. Well. I'm 99% sure it wasn't Cherry Ames, and, like, 75% sure it wasn't Sue Barton. But it was definitely in the same genre, that smart, pretty young career women solves mysteries and maybe falls in love genre. I read through the plot descriptions of the Ames and Barton novels and none of them sounded like the book I'm looking for. It was NOT Call the Midwife (much too recent) and I don't remember it featuring any nuns, and it was definitely fiction aimed at young girls. Does anyone know what book I'm think of? Did I just make it up in my brain and head? I was a voracious reader as a kid and for all I know, I'm mixing up elements of several books I read. posted by Aquifer to Media & Arts (2 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite   This looks like it might be the one. posted by Redstart at 8:32 PM on April 23 [4 favorites] I just yelled, "YES!" and woke up my son.

Waymo claims that Uber hid a LiDAR device which was developed by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski based on its technology. This comes after the previous assertion that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 GB of confidential material from Google before leaving the company and founding self-driving truck company Otto. Soon after its formation, Otto was purchased by Uber for $680 million. Waymo says it was only given access to the LiDAR device during the ongoing investigation after an Uber engineer admitted its existence. However, spokesperson from the ride-hailing firm, Matt Kallman, says that the LiDAR system was made available to Waymo from the very start and that it could have been photographed as part of the information sharing ordered by the court, Bloomberg reports. Waymo hopes this latest move will convince a judge to ban Levandowski from working on Uber’s ongoing autonomous car project.

(REUTERS/Yves Herman/Files) The European Union is considering legislative measures to harmonise how online platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google take down hate speech and incitement to violence, a draft document seen by Reuters shows. The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to companies coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. In a draft policy paper, the European Commission says there is a "high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content - be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights". sponsored Apple iPhone 6 (Space Grey,... ₹ 27,950.00 Apple iPhone 6S (Space Grey,... ₹ 41,490.00 Apple iPhone 6S (Rose Gold,... ₹ 41,999.00 Watch video "Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda)." The Commission says it may come forward with legislative and/or non-legislative instruments by the end of the year to address "legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms". Germany last month unveiled a law which would fine social media companies up to 50 million euros ($53.62 million) if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech. Facebook, Twitter, Google's YouTube and Microsoft last year agreed to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, but were criticised by the Commission for not being fast enough. Companies say they are in a difficult position as they are not liable for content posted on their platforms and not required to actively monitor what goes up. However, they do have to take down illegal content when notified. The paper, which is a mid-term review of the Commission's strategy to create a digital single market in Europe, says the EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. "The Commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem." An EU official said the Commission was considering adopting a so-called "good Samaritan" principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their websites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. The mid-term review should be adopted in May.

Let's Speculate Wildly Juicero: The Story So Far The Little Known Scandals And Conspiracies Of Einstein How To Keep Shady Apps From Screwing Up Your Computer David Nield Apr 24, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  browsers fieldguide macos security Software & Design windows Share Not all applications and browser add-ons come in peace. So you need to know a few warning signs to look out for if you want to make sure that only legit software makes it onto your machine. Here's how to avoid bad actors and weed out any shady apps that have already taken root. Desktop applications Image: Screenshot The key to making sure the software you're downloading is legit is to stick to reputable, trusted sources. If you want the latest version of Chrome, go straight to Google. If you need to reinstall Photoshop on a new machine, head to the Adobe website. The official app stores for Windows and macOS make the job easier, and you can download software from those sources confident in the knowledge that the programs contained within have been rigorously checked — though it's a good idea to browse through user reviews and ratings anyway to see what to expect. What if you need to go outside these carefully curated libraries though? How can you be sure what you're downloading isn't going to contain an unpleasant surprise? The short answer is: you can't, not with certainty. The longer answer is to stick to well-established apps and official download pages, and to do some research (even a quick web search would do) before you download and install anything new. Image: Screenshot Freeware download sites for Windows apps have a rather sketchy record, though they seem to have cleaned up their respective acts in recent times. If you do make use of them, stick to the major repositories like MajorGeeks and Softpedia, and click carefully through the installation wizards for whatever apps you choose — just make sure you're not installing anything you don't know about alongside the main program. At the shadiest end of the scale you have your pirated software from the darkest corners of the web — install anything (whether an app or a movie) from these places and you're really running the risk of something untoward taking hold of your system. This is another time when having a robust, reliable, respected antivirus program installed can prove worthwhile, even if it's just the Windows Defender tool built into the OS: anything particularly nasty should get flagged. If you suspect you've downloaded something you shouldn't then again Windows Defender or another antivirus tool will be able to help you out. It's always worth getting a second opinion too: free on-demand scanners like Microsoft Safety Scanner or Kaspersky Security Scan can look for problems without adding the bulk of a whole new application. Browser extensions Image: Screenshot If you stop and think about it, every time you install a browser extension you're putting a lot of trust in the add-on and its developer — that the software won't be spying on your browsing habits or injecting ads into the sites you visit. It's just as important to guard against rogue browser extensions as it is against bad desktop applications. You can apply the same principles we've talked about already. Make sure you're downloading plug-ins from the official repositories for Chrome, Firefox or whatever browser you're using, and be wary of venturing outside these libraries. If you do seek extensions elsewhere, look for user reviews and recommendations from the tech press, and be cautious about installing extensions that haven't been updated in a long time, or new extensions from developers you've never heard of — not that there's anything wrong with a new developer having a new extension on the market, but do some background research first. Of course, as with websites, there are many shades of grey when it comes to extensions. Some developers will think it's entirely legitimate to gather a bit of anonymized user data in return for a free app — it's what Google does with Gmail after all — but they should absolutely be telling you about this in the terms and conditions for the add-on, so check the small print and the extension description carefully. When you install an extension, you'll often be able to see the permissions it wants, just like when you install an app on your phone. These permissions aren't a guarantee one way or the other that something is or isn't safe, but they might raise a few red flags, so don't click through and approve them without a careful read. Extensions usually auto-update too, which means older add-ons that were originally safe can morph into shady ones if they're taken over by another developer and modified. For that reason and others you should uninstall extensions you're not regularly to minimise the risk of them becoming a potential backdoor for bad actors. Though not all extensions are a threat. Most of the time you can be confident sticking to the big-name extensions — from the Googles and the Facebooks and the Instapapers of this world — and if you pull these from official sources then you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Keep your system's security software updated, and your browser updated, and you should get warnings about the worst offenders as far as shady extensions go. It's also a good idea to reset your browser back to its default settings if you think something has gone awry (your bookmarks and passwords won't be affected) — on Chrome it's Reset settings in the advanced section of the Settings pane, and in Firefox it's the Refresh Firefox option which you can find by entering "about:support" in the address bar.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

April 23, 2017 04:52 PM BERLIN (AP) - Decades' worth of man-made junk is cluttering up Earth's orbit, posing a threat to spaceflight and the satellites we rely on for weather reports, air travel and global communications. More than 750,000 fragments larger than a centimeter are already thought to orbit Earth, and each one could badly damage or even destroy a satellite. Advertisement – Content Continues Below Last year, a tiny piece of debris punched a gaping hole in the solar panel of Copernicus Sentinel-1A, an observation satellite operated by the European Space Agency, or ESA. A solar array brought back from the Hubble Telescope in 1993 showed hundreds of tiny holes caused by dust-sized debris. Experts meeting in Germany this week said the problem could get worse as private companies such as SpaceX, Google and Arlington, Virginia-based OneWeb send a flurry of new satellites into space over the coming years. They said steps should be taken to reduce space debris. Getting all national space agencies and private companies to comply with international guidelines designed to prevent further junk in orbit would be a first step. At the moment those rules - which can be costly to implement - aren't legally binding. ESA's director-general, Jan Woerner, told The Associated Press on Friday that so-called mega-constellations planned by private companies should have a maximum orbital lifetime of 25 years. After that, the satellite constellations would need to move out of the way, either by going into a so-called 'graveyard orbit' or returning to Earth. That's because dead satellites pose a double danger: they can collide with other spacecraft or be hit by debris themselves, potentially breaking up into tiny pieces that become a hazard in their own right. The nightmare scenario would be an ever-growing cascade of collisions resulting in what's called a Kessler syndrome - named after the NASA scientist who first warned about it four decades ago - that could render near-Earth orbits unusable to future generations. "Without satellites, you don't have weather reports, live broadcasts from the other side of the planet, stock market, air travel, online shopping, sat-nav in your car," Rolf Densing, ESA's director of operations, said. "You might as well move into a museum if all the satellites are switched off." Even if future launches adhere to the guidelines, though, there's the question of what to do with all of the debris already in orbit. "We have to clean the vacuum, which means we need a vacuum cleaner," Woerner said. Just how such a device would work is still unclear. Proposals include garbage-cleaning spacecraft armed with harpoons, nets, robotic arms and even lasers to fry really small bits of debris. Luisa Innocenti, the head of ESA's "clean space" initiative, said a mission is already in the works to bring down a very large piece of debris. "It's a very complex operation because nobody wants to fail," she said. "Nobody wants to hit the debris and create another cloud of debris." ___ ESA video explaining problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT7typHkpVg Credits By FRANK JORDANS Updated: April 23, 2017 04:52 PM (Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

By Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson 8:32 AM Monday Apr 24, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Banking Mobile Business By now we should be paying for everything with our mobiles, right? Photo / Supplied The technology is ready. Banks know how to use it. Consumers want it now. So just when will we get the digital wallets we've been promised? What seems like a straightforward question with an equally straightforward solution has become mired in ­politics, as tech companies and banks disagree on the right way to deliver convenient mobile payment exper­iences and Australia's competition watchdog and courts are forced to step in to mediate. But there have been small breakthroughs lately in what experts say is a sign that digital services will replace dog-eared wallets and overstuffed purses within years rather than decades. While Google Android phones were first to add secure Near Field Communication chips for digital payments, it was Apple that debuted a branded payment solution in its phones. Apple Pay arrived in the US in 2014, and in Australia the following year. But the service, which securely turns your smartphone into a debit or ­credit card to be tapped at the cash register, was only compatible with ­directly issued American Express credit cards. It's now supported by 48 smaller financial institutions and one of the four big banks, ANZ. Similarly, Google launched its Android Pay service with a host of smaller banks and credit unions, albeit many more of them. ANZ has since joined their ranks. But it's Samsung Pay, the last of the three to launch, that claimed a significant victory this month, slipping Westpac into its digital wallet. Continued below. Related Content Labour MP Stuart Nash apologises over mental health comments Your Views: Readers Letters Tauranga worker must pay $66,681 damages after bidding for contract against employer More than nine million Westpac customers can now use Samsung Pay to buy goods with the tap of a smartphone or a Gear S3 smartwatch, in addition to Citibank and American Express customers. Samsung Australia mobile division vice-president Richard Fink says signing up Westpac means "about a third of the market" can now use Samsung Pay in their smartphones rather than flash the plastic. But he admits launching a digital wallet everyone can use will take time. The big banks are not adopting external payment systems quickly, preferring transactions delivered from their own apps. "It's still a developing space for everyone; for Samsung as a tech­nology provider but also for the banks," Fink says. "The pieces are all falling together. We certainly have been ­engaged with all the big four banks since launch." Westpac's move to Samsung Pay could be the start of a drift from the big financial institutions towards Android-based solutions. It follows their failure to collectively ­bargain for access to payment technology within Apple's iPhone, a move designed to let the banks, including the CBA, NAB and Westpac, deliver their own in-app payments rather than pay transaction fees to use Apple Pay. A spokesman for the group, Lance Blockley, says the case had been "about consumer choice" and ensuring "the course of development for ­mobile wallets in Australia (was not) dictated by a single overseas corporation". "Mobile wallets are currently overwhelmingly focused on mobile payments but will soon take in loyalty programs, mass transit ticketing, access, identity, and a great number of other future innovations," he says. "Ultimately, there is no technical barrier standing in the way of our ­entire physical wallet becoming digital." - news.com.au By Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Name: Subject: Message: The Galaxy S8 is evidence of Samsung’s changing attitude to bloatware Features Newsby Kris Carlon11 hours ago 61 1393 53 Remember back when we all used to have a field day bashing Samsung bloatware? There was sooo much of it, you couldn’t disable or uninstall it, and most things duplicated stuff that Google already did perfectly well (and also pre-installed on Galaxy phones). But starting with the Galaxy S6, Samsung started to change its attitude toward bloatware, and the Galaxy S8 benefits greatly from the continuation of that tendency. But more to the point, we benefit greatly. As much as we understand how lucrative these software deals can be to smartphone manufacturers, none of us really want bloatware clogging up our phones. In the past you could barely uninstall any, having to settle for disabling a few and making your peace with most, but times have changed. See also: Does bloatware drain your battery? – Gary explains June 25, 2016 The 32 GB Galaxy S7 had 8 GB of storage taken up by its ROM and pre-loaded apps. The 64 GB Galaxy S8 in my hands – even without any carrier bloat – admittedly had 12 GB used by the time I peeled the plastic off. But even though I’ve already lost a large chunk of my internal storage to the system it doesn’t feel so bad because the apps that are on the S8 are largely removable. Pre-loaded apps may not ultimately take up much space, but to have the ability to get rid of most of them almost makes you forget about the rest of the space you’ll never get to reclaim. Of course, pre-installed apps you don’t want, can’t remove and can’t disable are also a drain on your system resources, so any time you can uninstall or disable them, the better. The Galaxy S8 has 37 pre-installed apps (at least on my unlocked international variant). The Galaxy S6 had 50 apps, not including carrier bloat. By my count there’s only a dozen I can’t uninstall or disable on the S8, and some of those are rather useful like the dialer. You can still get rid of the few remaining apps Samsung won't already let you disable or uninstall. Even for those of you suffering from extensive carrier bloat in the US, there are still steps you can take to get rid of the few remaining apps Samsung won’t already let you disable. You simply have to decide if ridding yourself of them is worth $1.50. If it is, you’ll also be able to remove future bloat on your next Galaxy phone. Not uninstall, sadly, but disable any and all apps you want to. And it doesn’t even require root. You won’t get the storage space back, but you will block them from chewing system resources and you’ll no longer see them in your app drawer. All you need to do is fork out for an app called BK Package Disabler, which you can do via the button below. Install it, grant it the necessary permissions and swipe to the ‘Bloatware’ tab in the app. BUY BK PACKAGE INSTALLER Tap the check mark next to the apps you want disabled and that’s it (don’t just go crazy, look for the specific apps in the app drawer you want removed). You’ll no longer see them in your app drawer and they won’t be able to run in the background. If something breaks or you want the app back for some reason, simply relaunch the BK Package Disabler app and uncheck the box next to the apps you want resurrected. While it’s unfortunate we still have to resort to paid apps to remove everything we want to on a phone that cost us an arm and a leg, the base situation has at least improved from years past. On my S8 I can uninstall or disable 25 apps straight out of the box, and pay $1.50 to disable the rest. That may not quite be ideal, but it sure is better than it once was.

To get off on the right foot, you also need to define what the analysis is for - are you looking to best your competition, learn from them or maybe even partner with them? To truly maximize your efforts, however, it takes more than research. Before you head out on your quest, here are some point to consider: 1. Are you sure you know who your competitors are? Many companies look at others in their space and right away label them competition. But that’s not always the case. For example, a high-end burger joint may consider the neighboring McDonald's competition. Sure they both sell burgers, but the audience who goes to a burger joint selling $10 burgers is probably not the same audience buying a big mac for $1. It would be similar to a Porsche dealership considering a Toyota dealership as competition. If they were to truly consider McDonald’s competition, they'd need to start lowering prices to the point that they would be losing money, while McDonald’s wins out by bulk buying and owning their own farms and factories. Before you start analyzing competitors, establish what a actually competitor looks like.​ 2. Are there companies that are not competitors you can learn from as well? While competitor analysis is aimed at your competition, you may want to expand your research and look for companies who share your audience but don't compete with you directly. As an example, take two airlines - both have a fleet of planes and work hard to secure customers, however, none of their destinations crosses paths. They're both in the extremely competitive airline business, but they're not actually competitors. Recognizing this different can open up various opportunities to leverage each company's offerings and audience to support and expand each others business, as opposed to competing. 3. Don't put all your trust in your competitor Just because they're a competitor doesn't mean they're doing everything right, it’s easy to look at the top company in your industry and simply try to copy everything they do - many companies try to be the next Google or Facebook. But what worked, or works, for them might not work as well for you. It’s great to learn from successful companies, but you have to keep in mind they have the infrastructure budget and experience to do what they're doing. Moreover, the bigger a company gets, the more mistakes they're likely making, Google, for example, has more failed products than winning ones, it’s just that the wins make up for the losses. Google Buzz, Google Notebook etc, imagine if you were a startup and decided to emulate one of those Google products.   4. Make sure you understand what you're analyzing Companies use many tools for various reasons - it’s not enough to know what tools they're using, you need to also understand why. A tool like the Chrome extension Tag Explorer, for example, can tell you what tags have been implemented on a competitors' site - if they have a tag for Facebook, Google, Mixpanel and so on. This can give some insight into what tools they're using, but many of these tools can be used for various functions, so it’s important to gain an understanding of how they might be used before jumping to conclusions.​ 5. See the big picture Most successful companies have a method to their madness - it’s not one thing they do it’s a collective effort, with they have various levels of support. Before you choose to go down their path, make sure you have a similar support structure in place. 6. Believe in yourself It’s great to see what the competition is doing, but that can also lead companies away from what they originally set out to do. If your company is failing and the competitor analysis is an attempt to right the ship, that's fine, but if all's going well and your own strategy is working, be careful not to steer away too much - or you might be headed for an iceberg. Competitive analysis can be a great way for a company to learn its ecosystem, define goals and perfect its strategies, so long as you keep in mind that the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. Hopefully these tips help refine your own competitor analysis efforts.

The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to firms coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. In a draft policy paper, the European Commission says there is a “high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content — be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights.” “Such divergences may be justified in some cases [eg, for certain types of illegal content]; but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system [eg, by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda],” the paper says. The commission says it might come forward with legislative and/or non-legislative instruments by the end of the year to address “legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms.” Germany last month unveiled a law which would fine social media companies up to 50 million euros (US$53.62 million) if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech. Facebook Inc, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft Corp last year agreed to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, but were criticized by the commission for not being fast enough. Companies say that they are in a difficult position as they are not liable for content posted on their platforms and not required to actively monitor what goes up. However, they do have to take down illegal content when notified. The paper, which is a mid-term review of the commission’s strategy to create a digital single market in Europe, says the EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. “The commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem,” it said. An EU official said the commission was considering adopting a so-called “good Samaritan” principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their Web sites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. The mid-term review should be adopted next month. This story has been viewed 1541 times. Comments will be moderated.

So far, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it wants to protect the rights of the citizen and make Internet companies liable under Indian laws. But the court is against imposing any general online ban. This, it said in a recent order, would curtail the right of the “genuine information-seeker to gain knowledge and information from the Internet.” A slew of cases, ranging from a privacy challenge to a 2016 policy entered into between WhatsApp and Facebook to posting of online sexual videos to the presence of pre-natal sex determination advertisements on the Internet to the safety of online cash transactions, have grabbed the Supreme Court’s attention and time. Objectionable content These cases have seen the ordinary man engage Internet giants like Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft in litigation in the Supreme Court. These petitions demand that the Internet giants should also be made liable for the objectionable and illegal content posted online. Counsel for Prajwala, the NGO which moved the court about how social media is misused by criminals to post and share sexual offence videos of women and children, said Internet companies should be held responsible for such materials finding their way into their online domains. PCPNDT Act In a separate case, Dr. Sabu Mathew George took on Google, Yahoo and Microsoft for hosting pre-natal sex determination advertisements on their search engines in violation of Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) (PCPNDT) Act of 1994. While the Internet companies have repeatedly said it was impossible to forestall a person from posting objectionable content online, these cases have led the court to order Internet companies to set up in-house expert bodies to scour the Internet and remove objectionable and illegal content. Nodal officers The litigation has further triggered the government to appoint nodal officers at State levels to keep tabs on the Net for offensive material. The government’s officers would alert the search engines, who are liable to remove the objectionable material within the next 36 hours. Again, the ‘right to be left alone’ in the virtual world is gaining prominence as a subject of litigation in the Supreme Court. A Constitution Bench of five judges has started hearing two law students who have challenged the 2016 contract entered into by WhatsApp to give Facebook access to information and personal details shared by millions of its users is a violation of their privacy and free speech. Senior advocate K.K. Venugopal has said that the case would see a re-look of two Constitution Bench decisions — the 1954 eight-judge Bench verdict in M.P. Sharma’s case and the six-judge Bench judgment of 1962 in Kharak Singh on the nature of right to privacy. Both judgments had categorically rejected the existence of privacy as a guaranteed right under Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution. Mr. Venugopal suggested that a nine-judge Bench hear the case. The government has also conveyed the urgency to protect privacy and personal data on the Internet. Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi informed the Supreme Court that the government is working post-haste on “overarching data protection” laws to protect individual’s online privacy and ‘right to be forgotten’.

LG's Factory Reset Protection Can Be Bypassed In Mere Minutes Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/01/12 8:58am PDTJan 12, 2016 67 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares99 G4 LG News V10 Videos Google added factory reset protection to Android in Lollipop 5.1 last year, but not all devices implement Android in exactly the same way. That has led to some potential methods to bypass the account check. "RootJunky" already managed to find a workaround for Samsung phones, and now there's one for LG devices as well. It only takes a few minutes to get around factory reset protection. A freshly reset LG phone (like most other Android devices these days) will ask for the Google account it was used with previously. You can bypass by going into accessibility settings and adding a button combo for triggering overview. Then, you use the talkback settings to open a web browser, which lets you download an APK from& RootJunky that basically just opens the system settings. Because you added an overview button combo, you can use that to access overview/multi-window and install the APK. Once you're in settings, you can add a new user, gain access to the full device, then switch back to the owner account and reset without protection. The video above gives the full rundown. Factory reset protection is supposed to make stolen phones useless by locking them to the original account. You have to manually remove your account from the device to reset it without reset protection, but sometimes people sell their old phones without doing that correctly. That's the justification for making this method available—it's not specifically for phone thieves, but reset protection does exist for a reason. The above method should work on most newer LG phones including the G4 and V10. Tags factory reset protection LG video subscribe ...

Enjor Just saying that there are ways to bypass em like there is always a workaround when it exist exploits or bugs and these days everything comes with bugs and btw there was an USB key exploit in LG too (xda) If I remember. mrjayviper any links on how to bypass Apple's activation lock? :) from what I've read, you can't even get the phone into DFU mode when it's active. nezlobnyj true, hopefully someone will make a good use of Snap 820 kill switch. also it would be even better if activation lock would work with fingerprint scanner (or Sense ID in Qualcomm universe, as in theory it's much harder to conterfeit), or even retina scanner, or... whatever they throw at us in 2016. aRvInD LG sucks with its Optimus UI. So, LG please give great hardware phones Nexus coming year too... noel kait your comment makes no sense h4rr4r Sure it does. He hates their UI but loves the hardware. So a Nexus would mean he gets the hardware and vanilla android. s That's probably because you're an idiot. Peter Keller while i doubt that many stolen devices find their way back to their owner because of this feature i certainly know that many legit users got into serious and lengthy trouble over it. as long as mankind always thinks that there is a protection for everything the rope around our all necks will continue to get tighter, be it technically and/or politically. to avoid further discussion i won't use any triggering keywords here but those who can think know already where this will end. what was once intent to make us free will set tight limits instead. think about traveling, freedom of speach, rooting, modding, all gets more and more difficult and burdensome. ( there is much more but that would fill entire books) in short, i don't want protection rated higher than comfort and freedom and therefore accept that from time to time i can loose something ( same applies to making insurance company rich and in return get a pointing to the fine print ) usaff22 "in short, i don't want protection rated higher than comfort and liberty and therefore accept that from time to time i can loose something or accidents happen" Except some people don't want to spend £500 on a replacement new phone just because they lost the old one and have no way of ever possibly retrieving it. Ryan I dont think its really about getting the phone back as making it less valuable once its stolen. If stolen goods are harder to sell they are worth less and therefore not as likely to be stolen. Narciso Neto One thing I'm jealous about iOS is that Activation Lock system. Really impressive how it's "impossible" to get rid of. EdoubleU52 It's very much so a possibility to get around the activation lock. Either have to know the right people or how the fundamental processes work. Jon I can't get into settings in TalkBack .... Any help? lemon the same :( PhoneTechJay the LG stylo does not have the dual window mode is there a work around for that device. I was able to get the browser but no way to get to the file browser app. Jonathan Lara How where you hable to get everthing done i dont have dual window :/ PhoneTechJay Took a lot of patience, a metro app came up and it allowed me to use a browser, I worked with that browser and was lucky enough to get the mobile browser to open. after that it was pretty easy.

Jax Lazzo Rhapsody I tried what was in the video, and it doesn't work. I can't access TalkBack settings, I've tried about 10 ways to do it, and none of them work on this metro pcs g stylo. The only one that might work is waiting for the metro pcs thing to pop up about some app that has weather, and other stuff, but it hardly pops up. Apparantly the Metro pcs version has just about every back door covered. chris just found a work around in accessibility go to motor & cognition and enable touch assistant then click the newly popped up icon and press and hold the home button until google comes up then type in settings (lower the keyboard to see your apps) then go into settings, into apps find setup wizard and disable.

EdoubleU52 After you punch in your info and the screen switches over to the one that says "verifying info" or something like that. If you can cut your wifi connection off right as it switches to that screen, it sends you to a different scrren that's saying to check your connection. From there it gives you a few options and all ya have to do is find the privacy policy & terms of service. They're always blue and underlined and when you click on one of them, it sends you online then ya just hit google and you're online, p.s. You have to turn your wifi back on prior to pressing on the privacy policy link. I used my hotspot from my other phone and turned it off on that verify screen. You can unplug your router to but the hotspot thing makes it simple. Evan John when I click the settings nothing happens!

As AI algorithms grow more advanced, it becomes more difficult to make sense of their inner workings. Part of this is because the companies that develop them do not allow the scrutiny of their proprietary algorithms. But a lot of it has to do with the mere fact that AI is becoming opaque due to its increasing complexity. And this can turn into a problem as we move forward and Artificial Intelligence becomes more prominent in our lives. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT By a long range, AI algorithms perform much better than their human counterparts at the tasks they master. Self driving cars, for instance, which rely heavily on machine learning algorithms, will eventually reduce 90 percent of road accidents. AI diagnosis platforms spot early signs of dangerous illnesses much better than humans, and help save lives. And predictive maintenance can detect signs of wear in machinery and infrastructure in ways that are impossible for humans, preventing disasters and reducing costs. But AI is not flawless, and does make mistakes, albeit at a lower rate than humans. Last year, the AI-powered opponent in the game Elite Dangerous went berserk and started creating super-weapons to hunt players. In another case, Microsoft’s AI chatbot Tay started spewing out racist comments within a day of its launch. And remember that time Google face recognition started making some offending labeling of pictures? None of these mistakes are critical, and the damage can be shrugged off without much thought. However, neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and other subsets of AI are finding their way into more critical domains. Some of these fields include healthcare, transportation and law, where mistakes can have critical and sometimes fatal consequences. We humans make mistakes all the time, including fatal ones. But the difference here is that we can explain the reasons behind our actions and bear the responsibility. Even the software we used before the age of AI was code and rule-based logic. Mistakes could be examined and reasoned out, and culpability could be well-defined. The same can’t be said of Artificial Intelligence. In particular, neural networks, which are the key component in many AI applications, are something of a “black box.” Often, not even the engineers can explain why their algorithm made a certain decision. Last year, Google’s Go-playing AI stunned the world by coming up with moves that professionals couldn’t think of. As Nils Lenke, Senior Director of Corporate Research at Nuance, says about neural networks, “It’s not always clear what happens inside — you let the network organize itself, but that really means it does organize itself: it doesn’t necessarily tell you how it did it.” This can cause problems if those algorithms have full control in making decisions. Who will be responsible if a self-driving car causes a fatal accident? You can’t hold any of the passengers accountable for something they didn’t control. And the manufacturers will have a hard time explaining an event that involves so many complexities and variables. And don’t expect the car itself to start explaining its actions. The same can be said of an AI application that has autonomous control over a patient’s treatment process. Or a risk assessment algorithm that decides whether convicts stay in prison or are free to go. So can we trust Artificial Intelligence to make decisions on its own? For non-critical tasks, such as advertising, games and Netflix suggestions, where mistakes are tolerable, we can. But for situations where the social, legal, economic and political repercussion can be disastrous, we can’t — not yet. The same goes for scenarios where human lives are at stake. We’re still not ready to forfeit control to the robots. As Lenke says, “[Y]ou need to look at the tasks at hand. For some, it’s not really critical if you don’t fully understand what happens, or even if the network is wrong. A system that suggests music, for example: all that can go wrong is, you listen to boring piece of music. But with applications like enterprise customer service, where transactions are involved, or computer-assisted clinical documentation improvement, what we typically do there is, we don’t put the AI in isolation, but we have it co-work with a human being.” For the moment Artificial Intelligence will show its full potential in complementing human efforts. We’re already seeing inroads in fields such as medicine and cybersecurity. AI takes care of data-oriented research and analysis and presents human experts with invaluable insights and suggestions. Subsequently, the experts make the decisions and assume responsibility for the possible consequences. In the meantime, firms and organization must do more to make Artificial Intelligence more transparent and understandable. An example is OpenAI, a nonprofit research company founded by Tesla’s Elon Musk and YCombinator’s Sam Altman. As the name suggests, OpenAI’s goal is to open AI research and development to everyone, independent of financial interests. Another organization, Partnership on AI, aims to raise awareness on and deal with AI challenges such as bias. Founded by tech giants including Microsoft, IBM and Google, the Partnership will also work on AI ethics and best practices. Eventually, we’ll achieve — for better or worse — Artificial General Intelligence, AI that is on par with the human brain. Maybe then, our cars and robot will be able to go to court and stand trial for their actions. But then, we’ll be dealing with totally different problems. That’s for the future. In the present, human-dominated world, to make critical decisions, you either have to be flawless or accountable. For the moment, AI falls within none of those categories.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Opinion Facebook’s Friends is VR’s killer app Jamie Feltham, Upload VR@UploadVR April 23, 2017 8:35 AM I’m standing on a beach at sunset, drawing a sword much in the same way I would with Google’s Tilt Brush. To the side of me, UploadVR’s David Jagneaux is writing his name in the air, talking to colleague Ian Hamilton, who is phoning in from outside of VR with the Facebook Messenger app. Meanwhile, I’m talking to my girlfriend, who’s in the same room as me but also looking into VR through her smartphone screen. I take a selfie of the scene with one hand as I draw a blue mustache on my face with the other. It’s all a little crazy, and wildly exciting. Facebook Spaces is the official name of the social networking giant’s first full social VR app, which launched today as a free (and very early) beta for the Oculus Rift. If you have a Rift, Touch, and a Facebook account, all you need to do is head to the Oculus Store and download it. After those few simple steps, hey presto, you’re looking at the future of mixed reality. Though Facebook’s Oculus has its own suite of social features including avatar creation and friend finding, Spaces does all of that from scratch with a specific purpose in mind; connect people from across the world, give them the feeling that they’re really meeting up together like in real life, and then do things that they could never do within the confines of real reality. As an early app, it shows huge potential of reaching that vision in the months and years to come. In fact, it already has an impressive amount of features too, even if the inevitable bugs hold you back from fully utilizing them. Spaces started me off in a peaceful campfire scene where I could make my avatar. You can lay the foundations of your appearance by selecting photos from your Facebook account to start you off, and then fine tune with a wide array of assets. I quickly created a rough approximation of myself with the aid of a virtual mirror that displayed my virtual, cartoonish doppelganger. I was talking to someone in my real room as I customized my look, and noticed surprisingly accurate lip syncing as I chatted away. Surrounding me as I closed the appearances tabs were various items that have been created with Spaces’ pencil tool, which lays on a virtual table in front of me. I can either pick them up or start drawing with the same ease and intuition you’ll see in Tilt Brush, or open a library of pre-created objects like swords and flags. I’m still playing around with these tools as I use my free hand to open up my Friends list from a console on the table. Ironically, I’m fortunate enough to have a relatively small Facebook friends list, so navigating through to find David was almost instantaneous, but he had a much larger list and struggled to locate both myself and Ian on his end. When I invite David to join me, he has to open the friends tab, find me, and then request to join me. When he appears around my campfire, I’m overjoyed. Me and David have hung out in VR many times, be it in space ships or other social networks, but I’m excited to push the boundaries of Spaces as he pops into view. Unfortunately there’s little to be pushed, as either one of us would find the other’s avatar to have totally frozen across multiple attempts to join up together. When David calls Ian, I can’t see or hear his video feed, and the same goes for him with my call. It’s a simple bug that I’m sure will get working very soon, and I still had voice chat to share laughter over as I scribbled over David’s face, too. Now that's what I call mixed reality. @Hero_Kvatch @David_Jagneaux Facebook's Spaces to Messenger call. @UploadVR pic.twitter.com/4HU51Kmm1l — Ian Hamilton (@hmltn) April 18, 2017 Even with these issues, Facebook Spaces started to make a social network footprint in seconds. People are already sharing screencaps of my time talking to them in VR on Twitter feeds. As slight as it may sound, navigating around Spaces was my favorite part of the experience so far. With a surprising breadth of options, I’d assumed it would take me days to get used to the interface, but I was flying through it with ease in minutes. Friends, Tools, Objects, Media and more were all on the console in front of me. Sharing an image was as simple as scrolling through my Media feed, grabbing a photo like a postcard, and then tossing it into the middle of the table. Touching my wrist would bring up options menu where I could sign out, and surrender my headset to my girlfriend, who immediately tried to call her family in VR (they’ll do it in an hour). Of course, many of these features are available in long-established VR apps like Altspace, Rec Room, and BigScreen, and the teams behind those experiences have laid the groundwork connecting the relatively small VR installed base as it currently stands. Facebook, though, could connect the 1.2 billion people already using its Messenger app to anyone wearing a Rift as it works toward one day getting everyone inside its headsets. And that’s really the major point here. Facebook Spaces is something I’m excited to start digging deeper into not just with my friends in VR but also my friends and family outside of VR. Every time I call my Dad (which I’ll be doing as soon as this post wraps up), I’m going to be showing him the future through a window in the palm of his hand. It’s early days but Facebook already seems to be getting a grasp on and taming the unwieldy possibilities of VR with friends and family. Dare we say it, Facebook might have created the killer app in the process. This story originally appeared on Uploadvr.com.

Google Photos v2.13 adds video stabilization, hints at possible Google+ integration [APK Download + Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 4:09am PDTApr 12, 2017 185 Plus 1 on G+ 133 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares415 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Video Stabilization 2 Teardown 2.1 The return of Google+? 2.2 Austin's Mystery Feature 3 Download There's nothing like adding great new features with an update. The latest version of Photos began its rollout yesterday and it enables a video stabilization feature we've been looking forward to for months. A teardown of the apk also raises the question: Would the Photos app ever find itself reintegrating Google+ in some way? If you're not in the mood to wait for this version to hit your device, hit the APK Mirror link at the bottom to get this update a bit early. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Video stabilizer Video Stabilization Back in August of last year, the Photos v1.25 update revealed Google was working to add video stabilization to Photos, followed shortly by another update that made it obvious the stabilization would happen locally on a given device. It may have taken a little while, but stabilization is now live! To stabilize a video, just open it in the viewer and tap the pen icon to edit it. If the video isn't already locally stored on your device, it will be downloaded. Once you're in the editor, the Stabilize button can be found at the bottom left. When you tap on it, a progress bar pops up to show how far along the process is. Several factors will play into how long it takes for a video to process. I waited about 16 seconds to stabilize a 19-second 1920x1080 (30fps) clip on my Pixel, but it could take more or less time depending on the video duration, resolution, framerate, and the processing power of the device. When the processing is finished, you can watch the stabilized video. Notice that the Stabilize button is now blue to show that the effect is active. You can toggle it on and off to compare the results. Since this is electronic stabilization, there will naturally be some cropping of the video, but the results seem fairly good. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. The return of Google+? Assuming you've been using a smartphone for a couple of years, you may remember there was a time when Google's cloud storage solution for photos was provided by Google+. That was before Photos was split off into a separate service and app. (2015 seems so long ago.) While it has been trendy to take shots at Google+ for a low(-ish) user count and having some of its features unceremoniously lopped off to create entirely separate products, some users have lamented the loss of sharing photo albums through Google+ Circles. It can still be done easily, but there are some ways it could be improved. There's also no good way to follow just the photo-centric posts from people or whole circles. Well, that might be changing. The latest version of the Photos app includes new text plucked directly from the Google+ app. The lines describe a few familiar activities like creating circles, adding people to them, and following people and pages. code <string name="oob_first_circle_one_click_alert_title">Adding to %1$s just got easier</string> <string name="oob_first_circle_picker_alert_change">Change</string> <string name="oob_first_circle_picker_alert_message">People and pages you follow will be notified. Others may see this information publicly.</string> <string name="oob_first_circle_picker_alert_message2">People you follow can use Hangouts with you.</string> <string name="oob_first_circle_picker_alert_title">Following people and pages</string> <string name="oob_first_circle_one_click_alert_message">Tapping “Follow” is now all it takes to add someone to the %1$s circle. You can also touch and hold “Follow” to choose a different circle.</string> <string name="one_click_change_circles_toast_message">When you first follow someone, you can touch and hold “Follow” to choose a circle other than %1$s.</string> <string name="new_circle_create">Create</string> <string name="new_circle_dialog_hint">Circle name</string> <string name="new_circle_dialog_title">New circle</string> <string name="new_circle_your_circles_message">Include this circle when you share things with “Your circles”.</string> <string name="new_circle_your_circles_title">Your circles</string> <string name="toast_circle_already_exists">You already have a circle with this name.</string> <string name="toast_new_circle_created">"Created new circle '%1$s'"</string> <string name="add_to_circles_learn_more_link_text">Learn more</string> <string name="cannot_add_to_circle_error_message">Could not follow %1$s</string> <string name="cannot_add_to_circle_error_title">Failed to follow</string> <string name="circle_properties_dialog_title">Circle settings</string> <string name="following_circle_name">Following</string> new layout: /res/layout/circle_properties_dialog.xml Unfortunately, there are a couple of reasons I'm skeptical about what this could be. To begin with, the text isn't just a copy of the lines from Google+, the string names actually match up perfectly. My second concern is that none of the text actually refers to a photo-specific feature, only circle management and the broad concept of sharing. In other words, there's no sign that there's any actual work to add a feature directly related to Google+. Even if a wider variety of sharing methods isn't on the table, there is another viable explanation: SendKit might be adding support for Google+ contacts. This probably requires a little quick explanation. Last year, an update to the Photos app included a line teasing "faster sharing" which was later shown to be a feature of a library called SendKit. When the feature launched, it turned out to be just an in-app list of your contacts that you could share to via email or SMS. It's possible this integration might allow the app to include your G+ contacts and circles in the list. There's definitely room to doubt the clues since the lines could have been added unintentionally with an included library or some piece of shared code. On the other hand, these strings probably wouldn't be here if there wasn't something happening. Austin's Mystery Feature Every once in a while, the developers at Google decide to have a little fun and intentionally tease us with something too vague to really speculate on. In this case, it's something called Austin's Mystery Feature. Yes, that's all there is to know about it for now. Note: We skipped this one when it turned up in v2.12 because there weren't any other immediately obvious changes, but it's worth a mention now. code <string name="photos_photofragment_components_photobar_action_austins_mystery_feature">\????</string> from /res/layout/photo_action_bar.xml <ViewStub android:id="@id/austins_mystery_feature_stub" android:layout="@layout/photo_action_bar_austins_mystery_feature_button" android:layout_width="0.0dip" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:layout_weight="1.0" /> from /res/layout/photo_action_bar_austins_mystery_feature_button.xml <RelativeLayout android:visibility="gone" android:layout_width="0.0dip" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:layout_weight="1.0" xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <ImageView android:gravity="center" android:id="@id/austins_mystery_feature" android:background="@drawable/photo_action_bar_button_background" android:paddingLeft="@dimen/photo_action_bar_item_horizontal_padding" android:paddingTop="@dimen/photo_action_bar_vertical_padding" android:paddingRight="@dimen/photo_action_bar_item_horizontal_padding" android:paddingBottom="@dimen/photo_action_bar_vertical_padding" android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:src="@drawable/quantum_ic_photos_white_24" android:scaleType="center" android:maxWidth="@dimen/photo_action_bar_item_max_width" android:minHeight="@dimen/photo_action_bar_item_min_height" android:layout_centerHorizontal="true" android:contentDescription="@string/photos_photofragment_components_photobar_action_austins_mystery_feature" /> <TextView android:textSize="@dimen/text_size_12" android:textColor="@color/quantum_white_text" android:gravity="center" android:id="@id/austins_mystery_feature_button_label" android:visibility="gone" android:layout_width="wrap_content" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:text="@string/photos_photofragment_components_photobar_action_austins_mystery_feature" android:layout_alignBottom="@id/austins_mystery_feature" android:layout_centerHorizontal="true" android:alpha="0.7" /> </RelativeLayout> Of course, we can't just leave it at that, so I dug deeper to find out who Austin is, learn about his entire background, and ultimately deduce the feature he would want to build! Erm, actually, I didn't do that. I'm not even sure there's an Austin on the dev team. I mean, there probably is, but we're not creepy stalkers. Besides, he's probably a pretty chill guy and it would be super uncool to do that to him. Go ahead, Austin, take your time and make that feature as awesome as it can be. We'll be looking forward to it.

No one uses this thing, kill it already! Gjorgi Lazarovski Actually many people are using it especially people in the Android modding community. Major ROM projects are pulling from XDA and using G+ only for example. Dragos Lucian what Gjorgi said plus something else, except for the part that they leave xda for G+. There are a lot of ROM communities that have a lot more options when it comes to thread management, compared to xda. They still have xda as the main website they publish their work, but stuff like feature requests, news, etc, are easier to manage on G+. If you don't use it, it doesn't mean no one else does. I'm pretty sure you're not to center of the Galaxy. Gjorgi Lazarovski Well I didn't say every ROM project, but some for example DU which is pretty huge and also Screwed, Krexus. There are of course roms that coexist on both sites and there is nothing wrong with that. Dragos Lucian Oh, don't worry. I actually kinda noticed some of the devs slowly transitioning to G+ as of late, but I'm strictly referring to their activity. Corey Kinard I only ever get to AP articles from G+ G+ is leaps and bounds better than Facebook. Kill that instead. Cecil Hardwood Spoken like a true Google fanboy...lol. Actually Facebook is leaps and bounds better than GhostTown+...err I mean G+. Corey Kinard Any reason why? Just because your grandmother uses it doesn't make it better. Google+ has never heated up any phone I've ever owned from my backup budget phones to my flagships. Facebook does. Google Plus isn't inundated with ads. There are no ads at all in the stream. It isn't half the size or RAM hog, and it's never jankey as fuck. I prefer they layout, but that's personal taste. You know about getting personal though, huh? I'm a fanboy because I have an opinion? Guess that's how people incapable of higher level reasoning skills see the world. Lars Jeppesen People still use Facebook? Timothy Vreeland Yeah. It's a real ghost town. Except my feed is flooded. It's not for small minded people who live in a small world, that only communicate with Americans and family. Andrew Brown More people use G+ than Twitter. Martin Nice joke :-))) Timothy Vreeland Except if you weren't following the troll train you would know it's true. It's not popular in America, but world wide it has a huge active user base. I don't connect with my family there, but my feed is overloaded with posts from like minded people that share my hobbies and interests in other countries. Timothy Vreeland Yeah... No one uses it... It's just one of the most active social networks in the world. But you know better because you are on the troll hype train. Martin Better troll train than delusional train... :-)) Most used? :D It comes pre-installed, this doesn't make it most used. If they allow this BS to be deleted from our phones it will be the most not used network in the world ;) Timothy Vreeland I'm not talking about people that have it preinstalled. I'm talking about active users that make posts. It is currently at 111 million active users out of 2.2 billion Google accounts. Michael Schaap Google+? Does that still exist?? Andrew Brown >beating the horse into 2017 muhkuhap Just today the possibility to search for people disappered for me in germany.. It still shows as activated in settings but there are none to search for neither on web or in the app. In web after clicking in the search field it did not include any persons.. Then I checked the App.. they were still there.. i clicked one.. it showed the photos.. then they started to disappear one after one and finally the person-tab under albums is empty now. c'mon.. Richard Riker do you mean "group similar faces" and under albums the people "album"? It's still there for me, also in Germany muhkuhap Yeah exactly! That's strange.. maybe a staged "disable"-rollout.. Keep me updated if it hits you as well (not that i'd wish for though) TobiS This feature was never live for me in germany. I read somwhere that this is due to data protection reasons. How did you activate it? What's your system language? muhkuhap You just need to clear photos data and then start and activate it once while using usa proxy.. it then worked for years fine afterwards (you can disable the proxy right after) TobiS Ah OK. Via proxy. Perhaps google somehow changed the restrictions for the feature with the new APK. (Location based / System language) muhkuhap Muste have been server side.. haven't updated yet. Also the "Persons" section is still there, just empty. Maxr1998 Still works for me. Just hoping it'll stay like that.. 😳 EDIT: It seems I still have the old apk. I sure won't be updating the near future! muhkuhap In fact it had to be a server-side switch.. I haven't yet updated, too. This post here about photos just came in time with my problem.. Maxr1998 Well, that's interesting.. It still works for me. Did you apply labels to the persons? muhkuhap Yeah, I gave them names.. but I didn't changed anything in the last days.. it just went away this morning without any obvious reason.. and no one else seem affected so far.. Maxr1998 Did you try to do the VPN thingy another time, just to be sure? And disabled/enabled the setting? muhkuhap I tried to access the app using a VPN again but I'm not yet willing to disable/enable it again because it will reset all the manual changes I did.. kajover you just need to make a quick excursion to the US with a VPN (use Opera or for instance tunnelbear) to log into your google photos, which enables the feature. That is it. muhkuhap I did this years ago.. it worked fine until now. It still appears to be enabled in settings and the section is also there, it's just empty since this morning! kajover have you tried to do it again? muhkuhap It is still enabled and works for newly added pictures.. I'm not yet willing to disable and enable it as this would reset all the manual changes.. Dani I didn't have the same issue as you when you posted about it, bit but noticed that all the people disappeared today in my account. I'm also outside the US and had done the VPN trick months ago to activate it muhkuhap Oh boy.. my sympathy.. Let's pray and see where this will go.. Not that chances are big, but feel free to take a minute to submit a bug report about this (maybe just from the blank persons-page, saying that it worked fine till now) Dani Looks like they're aware of the issue: https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en&nomobile=true#!topic/photos/CLEPCnyjrA4;context-place=forum/photos muhkuhap Fingers crossed. ninjustin Wasn't this originally part of G+ in the first place? muhkuhap Nope. It was picasa at start.. and inbetween yeah it was sort of g+ i guess. TobiS Go for it Austin! Ryan Allowing it to post to G+ is fine, just dont start making it dependent on that platform in any way. Optimistic this wont be a backwards step since G+ has been gutted of all of the features that shouldnt have been in there anyway (like location sharing). Erick Wright Location sharing actually works better in G+ good thing it's still there right now Duder12 Location sharing doesn't work better in google+ when literally no one but Google tech nerds use Google+. However, everyone with a smart phone uses Google maps. Andrew Brown Google+ has any many users as Twitter. My entire family and most of my friends started using it for photo sharing over a year ago. Location sharing works extremely well on it. Timothy Vreeland You mean G+ has one of the biggest active user bases in the world, but in America it is only used by tech nerds, because the rest of the population is stuck on Facebook. Ryan Not sure where youre at but at least in the US it was moved back to Google Maps where it belonged. Gianmarco I stabilized a 4k video but it was rendered in 1080p anyone else had this? Lars Jeppesen I thought Google Photos only supports (free) video up to 1080p? Gianmarco I have the "original quality" enabled EvilHowl Maybe that's because any device hasn't power enough to edit 4K videos yet Gianmarco 6p but I edit 4k videos using cyberlink for Android without problems. The stabilization on G. Photos is very good tho EvilHowl Yes, it's true. In my 5X I can't edit 4K videos, maybe it will come in the next update... tim242 Oh, Google. And people wonder why OEM's have alternatives for Google's apps... Corey Kinard Are terribly designed and unworkable alternatives​, alternatives? Them adding or removing features to their app is the reason OEMs have alternatives? How altruistic of them. tim242 Google devs are schitzo. They add shit, they take shit away. They kill apps that people use. They have 50 messaging apps, and none of them are very good. Alternatives to that batshit crazy nonsense are a welcome relief. Corey Kinard Yeah, but OEM alternatives are usually dogshit. Google's "schitzo" nature certainly isn't the reason they have their own offerings either. Third party alts are what you're after. Basically everything on our Open Source platform having alternatives isn't just a welcome relief, it's the only way to go. tim242 I don't know what you are talking about. The Samsung browser is far and away faster and better designed than Chrome. Android Pay cannot even wish that it could compete with Samsung Pay. Samsung's gallery and editing app is great, and not the jumbled mess of Google Photos. I am certainly not going to give any cloud company my photos. Samsung's calendar and clock apps are much better designed than the terribly designed Google alternatives. Don't even get me started. Corey Kinard Seems like I already have.... Samsung's calendar is balls. The gallery is good, but nowhere near as good as photos. Your personal issues are your own, but searching through my thousands of photos, that are stored and accessable from anywhere, is wonderful. If I want to see every picture I ever took of trees across years, all I have to do it type it in. Anything else is a jumbled mess without that feature to me. Snapseed and VSCO are the only editing apps I use on the phone, and one is Google built. You can find a picture comparison of all the apps Samsung offers alternatives to, and among them all, you've named basically the only exceptions​. S Translate, Milk, S voice/Bixby. Mobile Print. Samsung link and the outdated email client... Other OEMs can't claim that, and still Google's nature is not why they offer them. You know, back to your original point? tim242 Google didn't build Snapseed, they bought it. S translate was not on my S7. But neither is G translate. Milk was just a dumb name for a rebranded Slacker Radio. Slacker >Google Play Music, for stations. S Voice no longer exists, but did some things better than Google Now. Mobile Print? That is a quick easy way to print directly from your phone to any printer. Google doesn't offer such a solution. You apparrently have no clue what Samsung MIRROR link is used for. Outdated email client? Oh, you mean the shitty Gmail app. Gotcha. Jordan L Is there a way to access the Samsung app's data using a web browser? Like photos.google.com, or calendar.google.com ? tim242 I don't put my photos in the cloud. That is a very inefficient way to store, and view them. Samsung's calendar syncs, so yes. Now, can you access mobile payments everywhere with Android Pay? Can you log in to websites with your fingerprint or iris? Didn't think so. Jordan L The magnetic tech in Samsung Pay is very cool, but just a transition until NFC readers are everywhere. Google Photos is one thing Google has done a great job with. If you have a major issue with it, that's a bit nuts. Right??? Login stuff seems cool, or I'll just let my browser store my pw. That works too. tim242 MST is far more than just a transition. Walmart and Target are two huge companies that just replaced their terminals in the last 2 years. Do you really think they are going to replace them again anytime soon? NFC payments have been around in the US since 2011. Here we are 6 years later, and it is only available in 10% of retailers. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, that TouchWiz launcher is much better designed than the Pixel launcher.... /s Cakefish Disagree on that. Google's apps are not always superior. Examples include Samsung Internet which has support for ad-blockers and hiding the status bar, Samsung's calculator app which has support for real-time editing of equations and Samsung's Gallery app which is better optimised than Google Photos. I intend to buy a Pixel 2 later this year but I will miss certain Samsung apps. Lars Jeppesen Samsung Internet doesn't support the latest HTML5 features that are really important .. it's literally an inferior browser. LOL Google+......I uninstalled that shiт the second Location Sharing came to Gmaps J.J. What is this Google+ they speak of? Cecil Hardwood A Ghost Town. Cecil Hardwood Hopefully the Austin feature has something to do with actually organizing and searching photos. When you think of search you think of Google yet I can not search my photos by filename or IPTC keywords. WTF Google. Searching for "Cat" only works if there is actually a cat in my photo and Google was able to identify it. Andrew Brown Do photos in the cloud even have "filenames"? DragoCubed G+. huh. Seeing hangouts there makes me miss hangouts. Hangouts had potential to be just like telegram but use google sign in. Anthrox https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWfQD72nNB8 Jason Stabilization quality seems decent. Strange for Google that it won't be processed in the cloud but on the device. It looks like it crops the video a little bit even though 1080 in is yielding 1080 out. It currently makes a duplicate copy with your original and one stabilized. Would love to see more video editing capitulates, especially if they are web based. Cory S Yeah, I am also surprised this isn't a cloud only feature. Jason Given that it crops the video and seems to save at the previous resolution, there must be some "interpolating" going on. Anthrox https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/81c1dc4f86ed15812fc07af77ea5c31196714f4532f4ff723574dc8310cedd6c.gif Margaritas Ante Porcos Users need sorting options. I am tired of that stupid blog style timeline. Everytime I add an old photo from PC, I never can find it on my Android phone. Who the hell knows when I shot those million of snaps? Google is so stupid and annoying. But instead of fixing millions of actual fckps, Google is planning on Google+ integration??? Ahaha Who asked for that? Nobody uses Google+. Am I so angry with everything Google does lately? SpeakethTheTruth Long morning? Or this is you all the time? UniBroW Or if you have an iOS you've got Google's latest update already. 😐 prabhat After stabilizing my 6p video it look as it captured from pixel. Jason I'm quite pleased with the results. I'm going through and stabilizing some of my past videos and there is a huge reduction in judder. Just make it available on the web version and I'd be even happier. Christopher Bement Maybe they're planning a big announcement at I/O...like magically G+ will attract users and Allo will suddenly be marketed correctly. Grey The old Youtube video stabilization was always a creepy thing. Slow and sweeping. YouNex I can't wait for G+ integration... It's frustrating when you want to share an already uploaded photo, and the up downloads then reuploads it ! Emin Guliev Pretty sure Austin reads this! vwnut13 Still haven't fixed "Brand Account" access. Hopefully in the next update. Julian Coronado Photos was already ripped out from G+ (for all the right reasons) I'm worried about this hmm Andy J I feel like #AustinsMysteryFeature should be a trending hashtag on twitter...... Austin Suszek ;) Artem Russakovskii Some guy on Reddit posted before and after stabilization videos: https://goo.gl/photos/KsF4QFiK8JtNBgWSA. Pretty impressive! https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/64xja7/google_photos_v213_adds_video_stabilization_hints/dg5rkba/ Dylan Ch’ng May 2016, this website said that Nexus 5x would get unlimited original quality for Google photos. That never happened. Cameron Brown Pixel did tho'. AP didn't know for sure. Hard Little Machine I own a Samsung Note 5 with Android 7 and an iPhone 6S with the latest iOS.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

By: Bloomberg | Updated: April 23, 2017 6:58 pm (Image for representation, Source: AP) European mobile networks Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG are teaming up to build an artificial intelligence platform, in a bid to catch up with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. Djingo, a virtual assistant that responds to voice and text, was first demoed by Orange’s Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard Thursday in the form of a donut-shaped speaker. At a concert venue in Paris, Richard showed the system taking orders such as playing music or publishing a tweet. The service, still under development, will be made available on various devices through software applications made by Orange, he said. “Djingo is an erudite,” Richard said. “We put all our arithmetic and artificial intelligence know-how into it.”Users can interact with the AI –using the command “OK Djingo”– by talking into the speaker, into a microphone-equipped TV remote control similar to Amazon Fire, or typing into an app on a phone. Artificial intelligence is the latest battlefield for carriers trying to grab back a piece of the pie from internet giants that threaten to turn operators’ business into just running commodity networks. Although the market for AI is cluttered, carriers have a long way to go to catch up with virtual assistants like Google’s “OK Google” command, Apple Inc.’s Siri or Microsoft Corp.’s Cortana on phones, or Amazon’s Echo speaker for the living room.

He also showed a challenger to Amazon’s Dash button — still in development, Orange’s Livebutton can do up to four actions, including ordering something online and sending a programmed text message. For customer service in Orange’s new banking business though, the company is turning to IBM’s Watson for a robot that answers client questions and becomes smarter as it learns their needs and specifics.

EU mulls legislation in the fight against online hate speech Technology Sunday 23 April 2017 - 12:05pm File: The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to companies coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. Photo: EPA / ROLF VENNENBREND BRUSSELS - The European Union is considering legislative measures to harmonise how online platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google take down hate speech and incitement to violence, a draft document seen by Reuters shows. The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to companies coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. READ: New bill to criminalise hate crimes and hate speech In a draft policy paper, the European Commission says there is a "high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content - be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights". "Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda)." The Commission says it may come forward with legislative and/or non-legislative instruments by the end of the year to address "legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms". Germany last month unveiled a law which would fine social media companies up to 50 million euros ($53.62 million) if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech. Facebook, Twitter, Google's YouTube and Microsoft last year agreed to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, but were criticised by the Commission for not being fast enough. Companies say they are in a difficult position as they are not liable for content posted on their platforms and not required to actively monitor what goes up. However, they do have to take down illegal content when notified. The paper, which is a mid-term review of the Commission's strategy to create a digital single market in Europe, says the EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. "The Commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem." An EU official said the Commission was considering adopting a so-called "good Samaritan" principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their websites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. The mid-term review should be adopted in May. Reuters Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

For example, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on AT&T got Nougat in mid-February, along with Sprint users, and those on T-Mobile. A little later down the line, March brought the update to users with devices on Verizon. In April, users on US Cellular can rejoice, as the update is heading for their devices. If you own one of the variants of the S7 (SM-G930R4) and S7 edge (SM-G935R4) which are compatible with the network, you'll see Android 7.0 being offered, with a download size of 1,5 GB. On the S7, the firmware version supplementing the update is G930R4TYU4BQC5, with product code USC. The S7 edge's firmware version is G935R4TYU4BQC5, with the same product code. Some of the features from Android Nougat, that the carrier highlights, are as follows: Nougat speaks your language: Bring your words to life with updated and entirely new Emoji, and the ability to use two or more languages at the same time. Be in two places at once: Now switch between apps with a double tap, or run one app side by side with another. Stay in the moment: Now it is easier to take action with more customized settings and direct reply options right from notifications without the need to open an app. Security matters: New features, such as direct boot and file-based encryption, help protect your device and keep your data private.

Twitterati can’t get over this Man mistakes cocktail umbrella for drugs in wife’s purse, and calls police! Twitterati can’t get over this Netizens could not decide what was the most bizarre point of this story - the man checking his wife's purse or calling cops first without actually talking to her or the fact that how could he NOT know what a cocktail umbrella looks like! By: Trends Desk | Kolkata | Published:April 23, 2017 4:49 pm The cops shared the bizarre story on their Twitter page and people went berserk! (Source: Wyoming, MN Police/ Twitter) Thanks to Facebook and Twitter, we’ve all now come to know that law enforcement officers the world over actually have a great sense of humour. We’ve stood witness to many instances of police officials warning civilians using punny, witty one-liners and ads that have not only served the purpose of their message but also left everyone ROFL-ing. But sometimes, they’re at the receiving end at such a bizarre situation, that a bit of levity can’t be helped. Take the case of one such incident that happened in Wyoming, Minnesota. A man found some ‘odd-looking’ objects in his wife’s purse and mistook it for drugs. Well, upon suspicion, the husband did not confront his wife but he took it to a whole new level — he called the cops! Yes, he did. Very law abiding citizen, right? Well, when the police reached his house to investigate the matter they found the ‘odd’ object as nothing but a broken cocktail umbrella! Yes, a red umbrella, broken into pieces. “A man thought he found drugs in his wife’s purse & contacted us. He was happy to learn that the items were just a broken cocktail umbrella,” they wrote on Twitter. A man thought he found drugs in his wifes purse & contacted us. He was happy to learn that the items were just a broken cocktail umbrella. pic.twitter.com/Yx5erLtzP0 — Wyoming, MN Police (@wyomingpd) April 2, 2017 The bizarre incident left many baffled and one even asked, “Has he never seen a cocktail umbrella? What rock does he live under?” To which, the ever funny cops replied, “No we had to Google a picture of what a cocktail umbrella looks like not broken into pieces.” @pigwigeon1 No we had to Google a picture of what a cocktail umbrella looks like not broken into pieces. — Wyoming, MN Police (@wyomingpd) April 3, 2017 Talking to Buzzfeed about the bizarre complaint, Chief Paul Hoppe said, “When the officer who went out to take a look at it told the husband what it was, I think he was a little shocked.” What followed next on this Twitter thread is simply hilarious. Meme-makers savagely grilled the husband. And the police department too joined in but wished him good luck! We wish him the best of luck in telling this story to his wife. Bring roses and a card to make things easier, my friend. #GoodLuck http://t.co/UdyemF5QpC — Wyoming, MN Police (@wyomingpd) April 2, 2017 Here’s what other users had to say: @wyomingpd What was he doing in her purse? — Prince~Eternity 💜🕊 (@prince19582016) April 3, 2017 @wyomingpd What a snitch.

Over 80% of online shoppers are prepared to go in-store if they can check product availability online and in advance, and more than a third of e-commerce transactions in the UK involve multiple devices in the buying journey. As a response to these trends, Google launched Local Inventory Ads in the US in 2013 and extended this offer to the UK in 2014. Google Local Inventory Ads is a multichannel advertising format that allows retailers to advertise both their online and in-store product catalogues. If you have a retail shop, a trade counter, or even if you allow pick up from your warehouse, then you should be considering Local Inventory Ads. To help you understand how you can use Google Local Inventory Ads to boost your sales and improve your Online-to-Offline strategy, Lengowhas put together an infographic, highlighting the advantages of using Local Inventory Ads, as well as providing key facts and figures. A few stats : 48% of clicks on e-commerce websites come from Google Shopping Ads (US) 4 out of 5 smartphone users conduct online research on their phones before making an in-store purchase More than a third of global mobile searches are local Have your say Click here to cancel reply.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Site Archive Why Facebook continues to conquer all Sunday Apr 23, 2017 at 2:01 AM By Farhad ManjooThe New York Times The tech world just witnessed a robbery. The heist was so brazen you kind of had to admire it, even if it was pulled off with all the grace of a gas station stickup. Facebook barged into Snapchat’s happy Venice Beach, California, mansion, took inventory of the goods, then lifted the crown jewels. First, a version of Stories, the fun slide-show format that Snapchat created, appeared last year on Instagram, owned by Facebook. Then Snapchat’s features made their way to WhatsApp and Messenger, Facebook’s chat apps. A couple of weeks ago, they got to the big leagues — Facebook’s main app — and the heist was complete. On Tuesday, the leader of the Facebook crew, Mark Zuckerberg, put on a conference to show off his loot. But he went further: He unveiled a vision of augmented reality — in which digital objects and effects are overlaid on images of the real world — which could undercut Snapchat’s mission to become the camera company for the next generation. His speech had a lot of corny jokes, but in reality, it was a performance that made plain Zuckerberg’s ruthlessness as a businessman. It also shows that he understands Facebook’s most important assets. Zuckerberg realized early on that the most important thing in his business was not necessarily creating the best new features. It doesn’t matter who invents digital mustaches. What matters is owning the biggest and most engaged network. And because he has the network, he always wins. For years now, the world has been doubting Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network — Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google’s onslaught? Could it survive its own initial public offering? How would Facebook adjust to mobile? What about live video? And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn’t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over. Hahaha. In the big picture, none of these things really made a dent in Zuckerberg’s expanding kingdom. Five years ago, after more or less cementing Facebook’s status as the world’s largest social network, he began to buy up and build future networks. He bought Instagram, which now has 600 million users. Then he bought WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users. Then he turned Facebook’s baked-in chat feature into its own chat app, Messenger, and now that, too, has a billion users. He offered Evan Spiegel, Snapchat’s co-founder, $3 billion to buy that app. Spiegel refused — but perhaps he should have taken a closer look at the networks Zuckerberg was assembling. Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world? You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features. Zuckerberg had done it before: Every time some other social company came up with social features that people seemed to enjoy — Twitter with the follower mechanism, Foursquare with checking into stuff, Vine with short videos, Periscope and Meerkat with live video — Facebook or one of its subsidiaries (or all of them) could just copy and co-opt. Sometimes the features turned out to be less important than initially thought, but that didn’t matter. At the very least he would neutralize his enemy’s growth, cutting it off before it became an existential threat to Facebook. And that’s what we’ve just seen with Snapchat. There is a debate in the tech press about whether Facebook’s shrewd copying has killed Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, or simply wounded it. After all, last week Instagram said that 200 million people a day were using its Stories feature, which is more users than all of Snapchat (160 million at last count). But that’s not the right question to ask. Snapchat could well survive, even thrive. The world is big; it can coexist with Facebook. But Facebook’s billions of users will now be introduced to Snapchat’s best features on Facebook’s own platform, eliminating, for a lot of them, any reason to switch. There is essentially no chance now that Snapchat will eclipse Facebook anytime soon, if ever. In other words, Zuckerberg has neutralized yet another rival. But there is another aspect to the power of large networks: They make other people’s features better. During his speech on Tuesday, Zuckerberg previewed a slate of new tools to turn Facebook’s built-in camera into a platform that outside developers can add to and improve. Snapchat has made a hit out of augmented reality — the tech term for adding cartoony digital effects on your pictures and videos, like rainbow vomit pouring out of your mouth or dog ears on your head. But now Facebook, with its deep investments in artificial intelligence (which it uses to power all of its other apps) and its broad connections with developers (who want to get to its billions of users), will be in a far better position to advance those ideas. “Even if we were slow to add cameras to all our apps, I’m confident that we’re going to be the ones who push this technology forward,” Zuckerberg said. Let’s end with a note on the ethics of all this.  Miranda Kerr, who is Spiegel’s fiancée, recently told The Times of London that she couldn’t stand Facebook’s behavior. “Can they not innovate? Do they have to steal all of my partner’s ideas?” she asked. “When you directly copy someone, that’s not innovation.” To which I say: Meh. There are lots of different kinds of innovation in the tech industry. Coming up with something first is not the only kind. There is a rich history in this industry of taking someone else’s idea and adding your own spin on it to improve tech for everyone. Apple’s Steve Jobs and the team behind the original Mac were inspired by a bunch of ideas floating around tech research circles, including at Xerox PARC. Then Microsoft’s chief executive, Bill Gates, saw the Mac’s success and — by creating a new business model for the PC industry — he ushered in an even bigger deal: graphical computers that could get cheap enough for most people to own. Or look at the smartphone. Apple created the iPhone, but if the tech industry had stopped there, smartphones wouldn’t have swept the world very quickly. Instead, Google more or less copied Apple’s software ideas in early versions of Android, and Samsung essentially copied Apple’s hardware. Economics kicked in, smartphones got really cheap, and they flooded the globe. And everyone did better: In time, Samsung hit on its own big idea — huge phones — that Apple copied, and Apple then made a bundle. So let’s not get too hung up on copying. All’s fair in love and rainbow vomit.

It’s not just a semantic difference: fears of a Google-controlled ad blocker on the most widely used desktop browser swept through media industry following the WSJ report. The ad filter, according to the Bloomberg report, would merely filter out ad types that have been labeled as “undesirable online ads” by the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes Google but also Facebook, The Washington Post, and several other publishers and ad agencies. We shall see: Google I/O is less than a month away.

Including nearly all-day battery life. Coming in with a 3,000 mAh battery for the regular model, and a bigger 3,500 mAh for the Galaxy S8+. Even with fast and wireless charging, you may still encounter battery life problems. If so, here are some tips to fix it and enjoy the best experience possible. Over the past few years Samsung has done an excellent job in terms of battery life. That being said, the Note 7 fiasco made the company be more reserved for the Galaxy S8. Now that it’s here and more users pick one up, battery life complaints will surely begin to surface. Read: Top 10 Galaxy S8 Settings to Change If you’re experiencing Galaxy S8 battery life problems or it’s just not lasting as long as you expected, we have a few tips and suggestions. Below are settings to change, options to consider and more to make your phone last as long as possible. In our limited time with the device since its release battery life has been better than expected. Considering the massive 6.2-inch Infinity Display and just a 3,500 mAh battery pack. While we’re on the subject, if this is an area of concern we’d recommend the 8+ over the regular Galaxy S8. If you already bought one and are looking for improvements, we’re here to help. These are some tips and tricks to keep battery life in check as best as possible. How to Fix Bad Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ Battery Life Running the latest Android 7.0 Nougat these phones have a slew of power saving features. Not to mention the improved display and Snapdragon 835 platform processor. However, we can squeeze out even more as the wait for Android 7.1.2 or Android O continues on. Lets get started. Find Apps Eating Up Your Battery The first recommendation is always to check if apps are draining things faster than they should be. If you want to fix your bad Galaxy S8 battery life, keep an eye on the stats and running apps. They can drain a battery faster than anything else if something is acting up. Read: How to Enable Full Screen Apps on the Galaxy S8 Whether these are pre-installed apps, or something you downloaded from Google Play, there is a chance a rogue app is causing an issue. This goes for all Android devices, not just the Galaxy S8. If you use an application a lot, it’s going to drain your battery. But there are also times where bugs or issues might cause an app to go rogue and start abnormally draining juice. We’ve seen it before with the Oculus app for Samsung’s, and something trying to use that full Infinity display could be at fault. Above is a screenshot showing a good day with the Galaxy S7 Edge. Getting nearly 23 hours of usage, with more than 4 hours remaining and over 4 hours of the important “screen on time”. This is how battery results have been on the S8+, just as an example. Keep in mind Android System usually uses the most, which is fine. If an app is acting funny it will be above that, and using more juice than even the display. If so, uninstall it to prevent further drain. Even try reinstalling it if needed. Reboot Your Galaxy S8 or S8+ If the battery is running down quick, there’s a reason for it. GPS, WiFi, or an app could be the problem. Something isn’t right, but we don’t know what yet. A quick reboot will often fix this, and save owners from dealing with a dead battery later in the day. In fact, almost any small problem or issue can be solved by holding down power and hitting restart. This sounds like a silly recommendation, but you’d be amazed how many times I’ve fixed problems on a family members phone by a quick reboot. Do it often. Screen Brightness & Sleep Time Did you know most users check their phone over 140 times a day? Constantly turning it on and not putting it to sleep after, means it sits at full brightness not being used. Always hit the power/sleep button when you’re done. So the screen turns off. Otherwise it adds up throughout the day. Screen on time under the battery stats page in settings is important, as the display will usually be at the top of the list. As a result you’ll want to head into Settings > Display > Brightness and choose something that works for you. Auto isn’t ideal for conserving battery, and I use somewhere around 25-35% brightness. Simply because the S8 screen is so bright. You can also change this on the fly in the pulldown bar, rather than using auto which will jump around a lot. While we’re in display settings some owners will want to lower the “screen timeout” option. This is how long the phone stays on before the screen auto dims and turns off to save battery life. By default many are set to 1 minute, try 30 seconds. This way every time a user turns on their phone it isn’t staying on for 1,2, or even 5 minutes at a time. Remember, it all adds up after 8-10 hours. Disable the Always-On Display Hands down one of my favorite features on the Galaxy S8 and other phones is the always on display. Being able to glance over to see the time, date, battery and incoming notifications without turning on the screen. This cuts down on those 140 power ups a day we mentioned above. Samsung even claims the AOD feature will drain less than 5% throughout an entire 8 hours at work. So while it’s a small difference, if you’re looking for every advantage turn it off. Head to Settings > Display > scroll down and disable the Always-On display feature. WiFi, 4G LTE, Bluetooth & GPS This one is a toss-up, but every little bit helps. Right? If you aren’t using WiFi or Bluetooth, you might as well turn them off. Even though they’re minimal when it comes to battery drain. It’s one more quick and easy step. If you’re in a WiFi location (coffee shop) yet not using WiFi, certainly turn it off as the device will continuously search for a network. It’s a huge battery saver at home to use WiFi, but if it isn’t being used, disable it. These are right at the top of the notification pulldown bar. However, the biggest drain on battery is location services and GPS. So using Google Maps, letting Facebook messenger use GPS to find your location, and other things of that nature. GPS has always been something I turn off and see dramatic improvements. Yes, Maps won’t be as accurate, but toggle it on as needed to fix that problem. Head into Settings > Privacy & safety > Location > and select Location Method, then choose “Battery Saver” or the middle WiFi and Mobile networks. This kills GPS which really hurts batter throughout the day. Even if you’re not using it. Use a Black Wallpaper Pretty wallpapers are pretty. That said, using a black or dark wallpaper will in fact improve battery life. Samsung’s AMOLED display technology works different than most screens. Pixels won’t need to turn on individually — or as high — to display a black image. After you’ve downloaded one long-press a blank area of the screen and go into Wallpapers to apply it. Again, it’s the little things combined that all work out in the end. Use or Turn off Galaxy S8 Software Features Samsung phones have software features that can hurt battery life, and others that improve things. As a result we’ll want to disable some if they are never used. Any previous Galaxy owner knows all about the many gestures or motion controls. If you don’t use them, turn them off to help save juice. Like swiping a hand over the screen to take a screenshot, keeping the screen on if the sensors see a face looking down and more. They even have a feature where putting a phone to your ear while reading a message instantly starts a phone call. It’s helpful, but disable it and just do things the old fashion way. Head into Settings > Advanced Features > and turn off things like Smart Capture, Palm Swipe Capture, Direct Call, Easy Mute, and disable “Smart Stay” in the display settings. These all require power and sensors inside the phone for things we rarely use. Install Battery Guru Regardless of what you’ve heard, don’t use a task manager. Just don’t. Our software handles all of that for us, especially Android 7.0 Nougat. Our phones have battery saver modes, but instead try installing the free SnapDragon Battery Guru software. It will make similar changes automatically as it learns your habits. Which results in nothing for you to do, but enjoy a longer lasting device. As long as you have a US model or one with the Snapdragon 835 and not Samsung’s processor, this is helpful. It basically automates turning certain features on or off for you. More than just WiFi and a few other things. In the end keep an eye on what it does so you’re not using a data plan, but enjoy the small improvements it will deliver. Battery Saver & Performance Modes Like most phones Samsung built in some battery saver and even performance modes to choose from. Under Settings > Device Maintenance > Battery you’ll find new performance modes. Basically owners can choose what works best for them. This will change screen brightness and resolution, slow down performance if you need to extend the battery and other things. More information about this can be found here. As you can see game mode will really get things going, including screen brightness getting a kick higher. These are a little silly in a sense, but will be extremely helpful for average users that want the phone to be smart and do things for them. This replaced the old school “battery saver mode” or ultra saving options from past devices. That said, you can tap the three dots up top and head into advanced settings for more controls. Like toning down individual apps and things of that nature. A Few More Tips Of course battery life always comes down to personal usage and preferences. Some are heavy users, some aren’t. We’d also recommend trying apps like BetteryBatteryStats to see what apps are causing problems. It’s a pretty powerful app that will give you more insight into your daily battery life and how apps consume it. Another thing to consider is these phones are brand new, just released, and still running Android 7.0 Nougat. Google made more changes in a few updates and now we’re waiting for an update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat. This should improve things further, not to mention Android O when it comes out in the fall. Read: Best Galaxy S8 Battery Cases Don’t forget about Airplane mode. It works wonders for preserving battery when a phone isn’t needed. Airplane mode turns off all data, radios, services and more and most phones can last 4-5 days with it enabled. If you’re traveling, give it a try. Weekly device restarts can also help to flush out the system keep things running better. Again, we’re not expecting too many complaints about battery life so soon in the release cycle, but these should add a little more if you’re looking for it. In closing, Samsung also extended the life of these batteries. Most phones after 1-year of daily use (lots of recharge cycles) only have about 80% capacity. They degrade over time. With the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Samsung claims after 1 year they’ll retain 95%. Something got better, so over the long haul these phones should hold up well. These tips and options are only the tip of the iceberg though. Try a new launcher, download third party text apps, or even better, uninstall Facebook. If you’re still not satisfied with battery life or need additional juice while out and about, take advantage of the fast charging technology in the Galaxy S8 and buy a fast portable battery charger. And while you’re here take a look at the best cases below to keep your phone safe.   1 / 1   1 / 1 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Case in point, in February all four major U.S. mobile providers–Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile U.S. and Sprint–joined the CBRS Alliance, which also counts major infrastructure players like Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, CommScope, Cisco and others as both sponsor and full members of the industry association. The key to unlocking the value of CBRS is a spectrum access system (SAS), which would allow the Department of Defense and fixed satellite communications, currently incumbents in the band, to continue operations, while also allowing for priority access licensees and general authorized access users. Federated Wireless and Google’s parent Alphabet recently demonstrated interoperability between their SAS platforms, which you can learn more about on this episode of Dan Meyer’s Carrier Wrap. From the carrier perspective, the propagation characteristics of the 3.5 GHz band are a good fit with small cells, which are designed to provide pinpoint boosts in capacity, or to fill in a coverage dead zone, in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. David Chambers, on his website ThinkSmallCell, explores how commercial deployments of CBRS-compatible small cells would work. “Not too dissimilar to installing Wi-Fi,” he writes, “building owners would be able to buy and deploy their own CBRS small cells, which would automatically register with a SAS. The SAS providers will charge a small fee for spectrum allocation…Such systems could operate in a completely standalone mode as a private network. More commonly, roaming with the major cellular networks will be required. This is likely to be handled by a relatively small number of ‘neutral hosts,’ who will aggregate and consolidate traffic from many smaller systems and feed through to the major networks. The idea of a deployment that’s similar to Wi-Fi, and the role of neutral host providers, in regards to CBRS small cells, ties directly into a recent interview Senza Fili Consulting President Monica Paolini conducted with Derek Peterson, CTO of Boingo Wireless, a company with a long history in providing neutral host Wi-Fi deployments. In the interview, available for download here, Peterson said CBRS “fits perfectly with what we do with neutral-host cellular and Wi-Fi networks.” He said access to the new block of unlicensed spectrum will help Boingo work with venue owners on “finding the right monetization or the right technical strategy. For instance, we may want to provide public safety services through an LTE network. The only way to do that before CBRS was to lease a part of an operator’s spectrum. Now, with shared-spectrum or unlicensed-spectrum models with LTE, you don’t have to go lease that spectrum. There are also a lot of new revenue opportunities that we can take advantage of that were closed to us before, where we were trying to use Wi-Fi or other technologies to fill the needs.” Building on the role of neutral host providers relative to he 3.5 GHz band, CBRS Alliance board Chairman Neville Meijers, also Qualcomm’s vice president of business development, wrote on the trade group’s blog, “A shared LTE deployment can serve subscribers from multiple service providers, offering capacity offload and extended indoor coverage. Such a solution makes sense in places where it is not feasible for each wireless operator to deploy its own equipment independently, for example in a sports stadium, an airport or a hotel. CBRS can also be leveraged by existing mobile operators for small-cell deployments to extend LTE coverage indoors or to boost data speeds.” Meijers also pointed out that enterprise or industrial users, for example, could use CBRS to set up a private LTE network “that is tailored to their services and managed by them.”   Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Boingo Wireless CBRS FCC Federated Wireless Google neutral host Small Cells Spectrum About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

Users can now enable 'Copyless Paste' in chrome://flags in Chrome Canary for Android, although turning it on might not do anything, a report in VentureBeat said. "If you looked at a restaurant website and switched to the Maps app, the keyboard would offer the name of that restaurant as a suggestion to enter into the search bar," the flag's description said. Data is only stored locally and never sent to Google. Chrome flags are a way to enable or disable functionality in Chrome that may not be fully implemented, standardised, or that might still be a little buggy. According to the report, Google started the work on this feature in February. Presumably 'Copyless Paste' will arrive in the next few months. --IANS sku/sm/vt SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. A new low-cost Surface device and Windows 10 Cloud OS combo could do some serious damage to Google's Chromebook ambitions in U.S. schools. On May 2, all eyes will be on Microsoft at its New York City event. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to take the stage and unveil a new push into the education market, likely focused on the U.S. initially. Google has been making big inroads into the K-12 education sector with its low-cost and easy-to-manage Chromebooks. According to IDC's latest numbers,, Chromebooks represented 49 percent of that market last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and just 9 percent in 2013. Another research firm, Futuresource, puts the number even higher at 58 percent, up from 50 percent in 2015. Apple, which has taken the brunt of the damage from the Chromebook wave in education in the U.S, meanwhile lost significant momentum in recent years. Apple's iOS, featured on the waning iPad series, went from a peak of 26 percent of the market in 2014 to just 14 percent last year, according to Futuresource. Microsoft's Windows, by comparison, did better, dropping from 25 percent to 22 percent in that same time period. For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets. The timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud Google is on to something with its Chromebook line, at least in the U.S. Combined with hardware support from major manufacturers, a mature app ecosystem, and ease of IT management, Chromebooks are the preferred choice for school IT departments. In speaking with some local school IT administrators – both public and private – here in Marlborough, Mass., it is the ability to lock down and secure Chromebooks, followed by cost, that is driving Chromebook adoption. 7 things you need to know about Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft is poised, however, to get back into education. Windows RT was a disaster for the company on many levels, including its confusing name, poor marketing, software limitations, and pricing. The Windows 10 Cloud OS, which may go by the name "Windows 10 S" when unveiled on May 2, is a different scenario. This time, Microsoft has a story to tell and a strategy to market this version of Windows to the right audience. Key differences between Windows RT and Windows 10 Cloud OSes include: A more mature Store for Windows Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The ability for the OS to be upgraded to a Home or Pro license. Capacity to run Win32 apps via "Project Centennial" bridge apps via the Store. A hardware team that's more in tune with commercial and consumer needs and desires. Combined with advancements in hardware and improvements to the OS, Microsoft has clear goals it wants to achieve with Windows 10 Cloud. In an internal document obtained by Windows Central (above), we can see exactly how Microsoft views Windows 10 Cloud as competing against Chromebooks in performance benchmarks. Additionally, recommended minimum specifications for a Windows 10 "CloudBook" are listed for hardware manufacturers: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor. 4GB of RAM. 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit). A battery larger than 40 WHr. Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology. Pen and touch (optional). Microsoft is focusing heavily on all-day battery life, as evidenced by its new "Power Throttling" initiative that's being tested in recent Windows Insider Program previews for the "Redstone 3" release expected this fall. Windows 10 on ARM will go further Windows 10 on ARM is another big step for Microsoft that is expected to come to fruition this fall, as well. With the ability to run what was an x86/64 OS on mobile ARM processors, the company can further drive down hardware costs, improve battery efficiency, and make thinner and lighter devices. Intel is making significant strides in reducing battery consumption, and Microsoft's Power Throttling goes further. According to the company, its Power Throttling support will be extended to other processor types (currently it is limited to 6th and 7th Generation Intel processors), which likely includes ARM. The Achilles heel of Windows laptops has always been two-fold: poor battery life, and risk management due to viruses and installing .exe software. Both of those problems are now being ameliorated through Windows 10 Cloud. Windows 10 on ARM devices are expected at the end of 2017 in the fourth quarter. Today's Surface Book is too expensive The current problem for Microsoft and its Surface line is the price. At Microsoft's Surface Studio event in October 2016, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Devices Panos Panay used a photo of his son to demonstrate how children naturally adopt digital inking on a PC. In the picture, presented as a backdrop, the child is using a Surface Book. That device starts at $1,600 and increases to more than $3,000 for the high-end version. Kids love inking and the Surface Book, but how do you get it into schools? While in a perfect world all kids would be able to afford a Microsoft Surface Book, the chances of that happening are minuscule. Clearly, Microsoft needs a lower-cost, entry-level device that provides a similar experience with an emphasis on a touchscreen and digital pen. A new "Surface Laptop" running Windows 10 Cloud is the ideal solution, if it meets the minimum hardware specifications mentioned earlier. It also could also replace the now deprecated non-pro Surface 3. Microsoft is expected to announce such a device on May 2, though some of our sources say the new hardware may not come until Microsoft's Build conference the following week. A traditional laptop without a detachable keyboard would keep production costs down (fewer product SKUs), and it would work for schools, where losing a keyboard (or breaking it) could cause headaches for IT staff. As a solution to making the laptop more Surface-like, the keyboard could rotate around like Lenovo's Yoga series or HP's x360 line. I also suspect a Surface Pen will be a part of any Surface Laptop, because the recent Creators Update focuses on inking. The new EPUB support in Windows 10 makes sense when you think of a push into education for Microsoft. Likewise, the seemingly odd addition of EPUB support for the Edge web browser and corresponding digital book section in the Windows Store makes more sense once you bring education into the equation. However, one issue Microsoft could face in schools is app selection. While UWP is evolving and improving the selection of quality apps specifically related to education, it cannot possibly match the Google Play Store. That could change over time, and perhaps Microsoft has some strategies in place to help lure companies to create apps specifically for this genre. Windows 10 Cloud and Surface for schools makes sense Recently, a nephew of mine who is nine years old saw my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. He said, "That looks like my Chromebook." I jokingly corrected him by stating "No, your Chromebook looks like my PC laptop." The point should be obvious: The education market is critical to Microsoft's future based purely on familiarity. The debate between macOS and Windows preference, for instance, almost always comes down to what you were exposed to first. Rarely in today's world do adults try both OSes, evaluate them equally and come to rational decisions. Chromebook or PC? The answer may be age dependent. If Google is already at 50 percent adoption in the U.S. education market, that is a generation that's now in the Google and Android ecosystem. Microsoft needs a plan to take that on and, for once, I feel like it may have some significant advantages with Windows 10 Cloud and a new Surface. The recent announcement that it will align the servicing models for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and System Center Configuration Manager also likely plays a part in this plan. Windows 10 Redstone 3: Everything we know so far Microsoft's hardware partners are likely to pick up the slack and deliver even lower cost hardware to run Windows 10 Cloud in the coming months in preparation for fall 2017. All of that combined with Apple's declining popularity in schools is a perfect opportunity for Redmond. As such, Microsoft's May 2 event could be the start of a significant push for the company — one that will have a lasting effect on a new generation.

But do I believe it?</p> <p>* To succeed, I assume MS also aims at non-English speaking countries.<br /> * Does MS aim at primarl school only, or also at colleges/universities?</p> <p>MS faces some challenges..</p> <p>1. Living in Europe with a non-English mother language/keyboard, I still have chosen English as UI language in Windows 10. Why?<br /> * Why even ask? It is my own choice! Nevertheless...<br /> * Easier to google/bing for help to solve problems, and I recognize the names of settings, etc. in English<br /> * I use programs/applications with English-only UI, and it is easier when there is consistency across applications and Windows<br /> * I teach for international students (EU exchange students, students from Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc.) both at home and abroad. I need these students to understand settings in Excel, etc.</p> <p>2. Windows Cloud, based on UWP apps in my teaching? Not possible for now!<br /> * Windows 10 currently installs UWP apps on my computer where the UI language is either based on the region, my physical internet address, or the keyboard. In other words: using my national language.<br /> * This means that the installed apps use a different UI language than Windows. My students don&#39;t understand the UI language of my apps (e.g., OneNote)!<br /> * Most likely, the international students will face the same problem as I do -- at least if their computer is bought locally (with our national keyboard). This doesn&#39;t cut it.</p> <p>3. Other language &quot;challenges&quot;...<br /> * Several UWP apps choose spelling checker based on keyboard.&nbsp;<br /> * This is ok. in tablet mode, where I can use virtual keyboards on screen, and can easily switch keyboard by the flick of my finger.<br /> * This idea is absolutely horrendous when working with a physical keyboard!<br /> * And -- NO! The language auto detection doesn&#39;t work well. And I&#39;m tired to manually having to go through menus to change spelling checker language...<br /> * Yes, I can handle more than one language. I do write in my mother tongue. I do write in English. I sometimes write in German. I sometimes write in Spanish. And I do not change physical keyboard -- it is not possible (except for, e.g., Surface Pro, but I don&#39;t want to lug around a stack of TypeCovers...)</p> <p>4. And then there is Excel...<br /> * Yes, the situation *is* improving. A few years ago, Windows installed MS Office in my national language irrespective of the Windows UI language.&nbsp;<br /> * When the language problem with Office was fixed so that I got English UI language in Office, Excel *still* insisted on installing plug-ins (e.g., Solver) with my national language as UI... OK, that has been fixed (I hope...).<br /> * Current problem: tomorrow, I will give a class in Spain using Excel. I *hope* I can use my own laptop with English as UI language (I&#39;m not that fluent in Spanish).

It turned out really well last time (looks at Windows Phone/Mobile). 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 As importantly, the tablet market where windows on arm is targeted, is a sector where only windows and budget are growing amonst consumers. By making a budget hybrid, perhaps something like the transformer book, windows can be positioned in BOTH of the growth sectors of tablets, when both samsung and apple have been slipping for four years. a serious foothold in tablets will drive UWP development, as will any substantial sales of a cloudbook. Re-positioning Windows to re-enter the fray for pocket cellular devices.  So this year, I expect not simple a surface pro, but a budget model. I'm hoping with a transformer book design, so it can be also more laptop like. And without the ridiculous screen sizes - perhaps a happy 10.1 inches, or even apple like 9.7. I expect this is why the rumours on surface suggest both arm, and intel - it'll be both.  Basically its the whole budget thing that is MS's entire pathway back to market dominance, in particular larger touchscreen devices. And that's also the point of difference for a cloud book - its touch enabled, its stylus enabled (as you say, a rotatable design would suit education best). If windows can make gains on bigger screen touch devices, that breathes life into UWP. And you can see the push for UWP in all of MS's recent moves - the option to lock windows down to store only, the cloud device, and the cheaper arm devices. THIS is how they are tackling the app gap - by fighting in an area where they have strenth - bigger screens.   0 1 day ago Reply Aden Rossinni I've heard of many schools here in Australia wanting to drop the Chromebooks because they either didn't realise that they couldn't do **** or realised later in using them.

It's interesting though that MS is trying to re-invent the Chromebook, only it will cost more, be less secure, and be restricted to a much smaller and lower quality application pool. 1 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 Cost more? Why would it cost more? It's using the same chipsets, the same type of hardware, and likely a free license.  Personally I wouldn't say that's better app quality, when the app pool (android apps) isn't even designed for the FF, and they are more geared to social networking and bus stop games than education. Chrome apps themselves number a paltry 10,000. Admitedly for the education sector, windows might have a small catch up, but its not exactly huge, nor are education apps demanding functionality. For the most part people use web browsers, and word processors.  The whole point of difference for Windows could is - its touch enabled, its ink and stylus enabled and its fully upgradable to full windows.

Ah, ok 👌, I see how that makes sense. 0 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer There's 1 MAJOR advantage Chromebooks have in the Educational market that Windows 10 currently has nothing to match; NEVER need to reboot to update the OS. Chromebooks merely being the Chrome web browser on Windows means that to install security patches/updates, all that has to happen is the user closes the browser and the security updates are installed automatically without requiring ANY reboot. That is automatically and seamlessly done whenever a user logs out the system, and if a security patch didn't get the time to install prior to the chromebook going to sleep, that's easily and quickly done on next resume from sleep. So, literally 0 need for reboot to stay secure, literally 0 need for IT department keeping tabs on them for security reasons. Compare that to Windows 10 where when you wake it up from sleep, you'll be getting that stupid "Updating Windows, don't turn off your computer" message for several minutes, especailly when they've not been updated in a while due to them not being used in a classroom. Imagine getting that when you're about to write an online Exam (which is the only place where Chromebooks were used on my Campus, everything else is Windows). Unless an IT department is being paid to keep those Windows 10 Cloud Laptops up to date, or those Laptops never turn off (in which case they can do the restart when the user logs off and thinks they've put the Laptop to sleep), Windows 10 Cloud won't be able to remain secure, making them a security threat to the Campus. 0 2 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Microsoft's policy is to not require a reboot for an update more than once every 4 weeks. I really don't see that as a big deal these days. Additionally, the Unified Update Platform (UUP) goes a long way to helping with this as well. 1 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer It's not much of a concern as a consumer, 'cause I'm only dealing with 1 PC (a Surface Pro 2 in my case), and I can easily take a moment to configure Windows Updates to match my workflow for the rest of my use of the Windows PC. No problem with that. In the case of a school campus, where there's 1000s of them - all of which don't get used for months until an Exam is coming up - it becomes a big concern in terms of both time and security. You'll need to pay an IT department to mange each and every one of those Windows Laptops/Convertibles, 'cause unlike Windows Desktops, they're not connected to a LAN 24/7, and thus can't be updated remotely. If you don't pay an IT department to do that, you risk having significant delays or interuptions when the Laptops are needed; during an online Exam. That's the major advantage Chromebooks have; savings in both IT department costs and time. With Chromebooks, any Teacher (regadless of background) could just grab a Laptop cart (contains about 50 Chomebooks I think) from some IT room (where the cart was plugged in charging the Laptops) at anytime of the year, bring it to the classroom, students simply unplug 1 of them and take to their desk, log-in, and can begin the exam (no waiting for any updates). Once they're done, they sign out, take the Laptop back to the cart and just plug in its power cable. To get the same with most of todays Windows Laptops, you'll need to be fussing with both power and ethernet cables for each and every one of those Laptops in some specialized cart, so that when in the IT room, they can be connected to the LAN and kept up to date remotely when not in use for months. That adds more room for human error, unless the campus pays some premium to get a custom Windows Laptop and Laptop cart that can get both power and ethernet over 1 connection. On top of that, would still need to pay an IT department to be keeping tabs on them remotely. None of which is a concern with Chromebooks.

Let me give you an example, you think this Cloud OS is a good idea, but basically its RT2.0.... fair enough, that is what you think.   But in the real world, in my experience at the enterprise level.... businesses have or want to strip not the Win32 stuff out but the UWP/Store from Windows 10.   So, I work with a medium size company that wants to deploy Win10 from Win7 which is virtualized and users use citrix.   Now do you want to know what those builds look like now in testing.... everything you write about in these articles are being stripped out... whether its the Store app, OneDrive, UWP, tablet mode, etc.   Windows without Win32 and open is kind of like Kate Upton without the rack, what's the point?   Windows with UWP might as well be a Chromebook, either way I doubt the consumer is going to come back in mass. What MS is doing is throwing a bunch a mud at the wall hoping the consumer is coming back, the problem is.... reality is much different.    0 2 days ago Reply CMDR_Shepard I work for a company that is considered medium (almost 500+ people) and we are moving to Windows 10 Enterprise at a fast pace.

So let's establish something, schools are enterprise.  You try managing thousands of these devices in the hands of children, it is a nightmare.  Apple's management utilities left a lot to be desired whereas Google knocked it out of the park with Chromebooks.  Chromebooks have significant advantages over Windows, OS X and iOS in the eyes of school IT decision makers: They are ridiculously inexpensive per unit.  You can buy 2 chromebooks for the cost of 1 iPad or PC. Hardware support warranties are inexpensive per unit. Management is all in Google's cloud and it is incredibly easy to maintain, control, distribute apps, secure and lock down these machines.  It is also low to almost no cost for the Chromebook management tools.  Most schools decided to focus their engineering time on faculty/staff machines that require more advanced workflows. Chromebooks are 100% integrated with Google Apps.  Google Apps is/was far more aligned with consumer needs and experiences than Office 365, so lots of people gravitate towards it because it feels less intimidating to them.   Lightweight, great battery life and are very reliable for teachers that have crafted their lesson plans around this piece of technology.  Consumers today expect more intuitive software and design that to them feels more natural.  What they get at work or school is just frustration, because they cannot reconcile the duality that this iPad at home works great, why can't my IT staff make it work this great here.  Chromebooks never had that problem, they are the same natural, simple experience both at home and at work or school. The consumerisation of IT is real, expectations have changed dramatically and has made the job of IT administrators harder everywhere. I see this new Microsoft device as the start of the great iPad and Chromebook purge, IF they can get the management right and work on their consumer experiences. Intune, Azure AD, Windows 10 and Office 365 together looks to be a winning combination for IT decision makers that is evolving every day.  I have already began moving in that direction at my school, it remains to be seen if other school IT decision makers will follow suit. 5 2 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Great insights jblank46!

The one point I will disagree on is the inclusion of a Surface Pen.  Those things are $60 each and require a battery to work.  An active digitizer is also going to add cost to the laptop.  Education isn't an area where Microsoft can focus on the top end, a strictly middle-of-the road laptop that is inexpensive and easy to manage will be key.  I bet their mainstream education hardware product will have a capacative touch screen so any $5 passive stylus will work for inking.  Most students aren't going to need the accuracy, pressure sensativity, or buttons on the stylus that an active pen provides.  Passive inking will be fine for almost every education scenario. 0 2 days ago Reply neo158 Then they should include the digitizer but make the pen a separate purchase 0 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM then none of the schools would buy it. 2 2 days ago Reply Dr_Henry_Killinger They'll include a pen+digitizer that nobody wants and price themselves out.  Kinect 2.0.   -2 2 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino They've made Surface Pen optional even on Surface Book (entry SKU), so unlikely to force it on anyone.

But the numbers, to me, show that Microsoft's strategy of "US only" or "US first" is as wrong as it gets. Yes, the growth of ChromeOS in the USA may be worrisome to Redmond BUT the USA is just ONE country in 196. In 195 countries, Chromebooks are absolutely irrelevant. Now you may say "well, that's why they should focus on the US". But that's, to me, the wrong strategy. They hold a large margin worldwide but if they continue to treat the US as special and focusing all their offerings and services only on the US, all that Google or any other competitor needs to do is to open those same types of services to people in the other 195 countries. We can take a couple of examples from history: - Microsoft has always treated Europe as a second-rate (or third, or fourth) market for the Xbox (and most other things, really). As a result, Sony's PlayStation rules in Europe with over 70% marketshare (in some countries over 90%). They've sold over 22 million consoles in Europe. Xbox? Less than 8 million. - Nokia's Eflop years saw the company leave their European/Asian focus and move it to the US. Because "Europe was guaranteed". As a result, sales in Europe continuously declined without the US market growth making up for it. - Sony's Xperia phones, at the same time, saw great growth in the European market because Sony made an effort instead of bothering with focusing in just one country (the US). When Sony decided to change that - around the time of the Xperia Z4 - and start trying to focus in the US market alone, sales of Xperia devices started to come down.   So whilst it's important that Microsoft shows aggressiveness in the US market to combat the Chromebook infestation that has installed itself on Uncle Sam's lands, it will be a major flaw if they limit the efforts to the USA. In Europe and other Western or Westernised markets, if Microsoft doesn't make an effort to show some parity of treatment with the US, they risk Google or someone else to come along and show that parity. And then they'll not only risk not gaining back anything in the US, they'll be losing market in those other countries. It's also worth noting that the educational system in Europe and Western markets is far better than the American and more likely to adopt new technologies to tackle on new educational challenges. Microsoft simply can't let that pass and not take the chance. 13 2 days ago Reply Azizelh Simple... The focus on the US is not because of the US. It's because schools here offer items to their students and are ready to pay some money for that. None of the schools I personally know in France for example offer them to students. They have some in dedicated rooms and the libraries, but none in class. Pretty sure it's the same or close in other countries. Reason is schools and tuitions are too cheap in most European countries to allow for these expenses. Most of the time of course. Im sure some school can offer them, just MUCH less than US. 3 2 days ago Reply Hoekie Over here we do. So that can't be the reason. Also deals for pure personal use. It's the US being cheap. We, rich Europe, can have proper laptops/2in1 devices. Chromebooks are for poor students/schools really. 0 2 days ago Reply GraniteStateColin It would be interesting to see the whole world including US. From the graphs above, there's not enough information to know. If what you said is right, @Azizelh, then you would expect global figures to track much more based on the US figures, simply because the US budget would dominate. On the other hand, if the total global numbers appeared similar to the "rest of the world" half of the graph, then @DJCBS would be right. 0 2 days ago Reply toph36 "Windows 10 S"?  That would be just as confusing as Windows RT.  I hope they keep Cloud in the name, even though that is not exactly what this is.  Although "Cloud" is more of a concept, so it does make sense to use here. 2 2 days ago Reply Azizelh To be honest, we thought Edge was a bad name for the browser, specially compared to Spartan.

I think this is the intent of being locked to teh store. As I recall enterprises, or schools, are allowed to curate their own store apps. 0 2 days ago Reply SuperMarioPlayer The problem with the proposed name "Windows 10 Secure" is that Microsoft already claims that Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows to date (which it probably is.)

Chromebooks require almost no support. They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support. When students log into a Chromebook it automatically has all their settings and files available, no matter what machine they are on. It is really simple and each user has their own separate experience. Windows is getting better here, but it still takes some time when you first log in and Microsoft's services (especially Edge) just aren't really designed for this style of cloud computing. I think this is where Microsoft really needs to improve. Logging in with your Microsoft ID should quickly give you the same experience on any device without having any setup required to use their services. Chromebooks accel here. There are certainly tasks that are tougher to complete on a Chromebook. Computer programming, video editing, CAD, etc. just aren't great experiences. These types of niche classes require niche hardware and services. For the vast majority of tasks required of students, mainly document creation and research, Chromebooks are more than enough. 3 2 days ago Reply HackAtak WOW, "They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support."   What you meant to say is to fully utilize a Chromebook, Wi-Fi/Internet is REQUIRED otherwise its a paperweight!   All too many on here tout the chromebook as good for the student which is CRAP, its cheap and easy for the school to cut corners and further indoctrinate the youth toward a product that has absolutly NO PLACE in the business world or upper education for that matter.  I for one hope MS knocks their introduction out of the park and boot these CRAPbooks to the curb!  I do business with many schools and they all agree, they went with the chromebooks because they were cheap and about the only alternative to textbooks, but they now see the issues with FREE and Google and how they control, track and monitor activities of chromebook users and collect that data so they can use it to sell to companies for marketing purposes.  Google Drive and Gmail, there aren't any bigger security issues in the world than thats two repositories for the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.  To better prepare students for the work place, using a chromebook and google docs is doing them a disservice...PERIOD!   0 1 day ago Reply bleached Schools have so much to hide from the CIA, FBI, etc. Do you hear what you are saying!

At least until there is evidence of benefit. 0 1 day ago Reply Curtis Quick You're kidding right? I guess you never thought that a student could take notes with a pen. It is so much easier to handwrite notes and the ability to add diagrams and drawings is phenominal! A Windows 2-1 device and OneNote will draw circles around a Chromebook any day. Chromebook is last century in comparison. Teachers can share their lecture notes with students. Students can share notes with oneanother - all without ever needing to use a keyboard! Every subject benefits from easy pen input. Science, Math, History, Art. Everywhere you have more than just words a pen is a great idea. Try drawing a diagram for physics with a keyboard. Or doing math problems. Or Art. You will quickly understand what I mean. Modern versions of Windows on 2-in-1 devices are exactly what students need in the classroom. They provide almost every conceivable manner of input that a student might need and they do it well. The only thing Chromebooks had going for it was cost, setup and a strong ABM (anything but Microsoft) attitude. Modern Windows 2-in-1 devices can do both and so much more. Schools were burned by iPads, and when they see how much more they can do with Windows 2-in-1 devices than Chromebooks it will be like the iPad all over again. 3 1 day ago Reply ozaz I didn't ask what the idea behind it is. I asked if there is any evidence that it actually benefits learning. The idea is obvious but just because something sounds appealing in theory does not mean it is actually beneficial in practice. If there have been any convincing studies that show learning is enhanced by student use of a stylus equipped computing device (compared to just traditional pen and notebook for notetaking) please link me to them.  If they don't yet exist, I would question the wisdom of schools investmenting in stylus-equipped devices for students just because they sound good in theory. Stylus-equipped devices for teachers is a different issue, and would presumably make much less of a contribution to overall expenditure anyway. 1 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 It allows you to take your own notes, adding notes to web pages, documents, etc. If notation and note taking is considered useful, which of course it is, then ink is useful.

Surely more than the cost of pen and paper. Hence my question above as to whether there is evidence it provides added learning benefit over notetaking via pen and paper. 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Schools spend quite a bit of money on printing, so I think that pretty much neutralises out. It's basically its people making notes on digital stuff, rather than paper. So on the website, or document, or map, rather than printing it out and doing the same. So its basically more accessible digitally.

Even if you do earn coverage, you can expect to see diminished impact from that press hit. More PR people are chasing fewer journalists. Unless your company or product already has star power, it's increasingly difficult to be heard above the roar. These changes have been coming for a while now, and PR professionals have tried to evolve. Many of us invested in social media—only to hit a pay wall as platforms changed their algorithms. Ironically, organic reach now comes at a price. So we sought an alternate route to market and jumped on the content-marketing bandwagon. There, too, we face tolls as publishers look to generate revenue from the virtual real estate they're giving over to native advertising Related: How to Market Products Online That Google and Facebook Don't Allow Distribution itself has been one of the biggest challenges. PR teams long have depended on newswires, but they're not as effective in the modern marketplace. Who cares if your press release appeared on Yahoo Finance or some other portal? Do you know which media outlets even see this? Most of them are glued to Twitter. The marketing world has made content a commodity in the race to dominate social networks. The way we've always worked PR now seems outgunned and out of options. But we still can adapt. We just need to apply in new ways the same ideas that have defined our profession all along. This means taking a fresh run at the basics, including finding audience and telling a story. Forward-thinking teams are learning they can break through and achieve their goals once they understand how people find, share and consume information. This knowledge enables them to adjust their budgets and tactics to align with prospective clients' preferred information channels. Here are five ways you can master PR's new rules. 1. Go forth and publish on social networks. In the early years of blogging, our firm advised clients they could use that same soapbox to communicate. Today, social networks are overtaking the open web. They reach vast audiences with precise targeting. Those networks quickly are becoming the go-to places for news, too. If you want attention for your brand, you'll miss out if you're not on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Sure, many PR professionals already are all over social media. But getting your news seen by the right audiences—especially if your brand's page doesn't already have umpteen million followers—is another matter. You need both paid and organic promotion to succeed, plus an understanding of the algorithms at work. Those wonky programs determine what appears in our newsfeeds. Their calculations are mysterious and constantly changing, but networks do offer updates and guidance. You'll also find an army of reporters and bloggers who jump on each development with advice. It's also important to understand the mechanics of targeting. For less than it costs to send a release over a major wire service, you can announce news on your brand page and promote it as a sponsored post that hits the newsfeeds of journalists and your customer audience. Related: A 5-Step Checklist to Maximize Press Coverage for Your Business 2. Package information as consumable, sharable content. Did media ignore your soft-news story? Repackage it as content that your customers can enjoy and share on social networks. Facebook's newsfeed favors individual updates versus those on brand pages. Information that's useful, interesting or entertaining to friends, family and colleagues is the order of the day. Craft a topic that resonates, work a little organic and paid promotion magic, and you'll be well on your way to achieving your campaign goals. It's also important to reach people where they consume information. Increasingly, that's on mobile devices. Facebook Instant Articles and Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) speed article load times and improve the user experience. While these tools are designed for publishers, Facebook's solution can be used by brands as well. So can Apple News and other apps. Related: The Dominance of Mobile Marketing Is Complete 3. Tap the power of influencer marketing. Networks can help with distribution, but they don't buy the validation that comes with earned media coverage. The power of influencer marketing can help you gain all-important social proof while you find another route to market. Influencer marketing can work alongside other forms of paid and organic promotion and distribution. First, identify who is not only important in your space but also big on the network you're targeting. Then court these power users and encourage them to share your information with their followers. You can offer a variety of incentives for them to participate. Some accept payment or free products—though you'll need to be careful about FTC rules that require disclosure. Others are happy to share positive reviews and mentions, gratis. 4. Pay for that article. PR used to draw the line at paid opportunities, but some are worth the price. It seems more agencies and client-side teams are considering the merits of paying for article placement. Before you decide if this is the right tactic for you, examine variables such as reach, audience and the value of the publication's own brand. 5. Don't forget traditional media. Bring traditional media into your strategy by engaging them when it makes sense. To get the greatest leverage, make sure you understand different media outlets' news appetites. When you have hard news, hit them hard. It's icing on the cake to get covered by media outlets that also publish on social networks or are picked up by news apps. Some journalists are multi-platform influencers in their own right, with strong personal brands and a vocal presence across a range of networks. Bob Geller is the president of Fusion PR.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The department of Canadian Heritage expressed concern about the impact Google’s operating system is having on small technology companies, and suggested the reason why the Competition Bureau dropped its antitrust investigation is because Android isn’t on enough mobile phones to warrant a probe. According to a memo prepared last June by Heritage’s broadcasting and digital communications branch, and obtained by the Financial Post through an access to information request, the 50.5 per cent market share Android enjoys in this country was much smaller than the 90 per cent seen in the European Union, which has a “larger relative justification” to press forward with its own investigation.  The European Commission levied several charges against Google in the past year, including allegations that tablet and smartphone manufacturers and network operators who use the company’s Android operating system are subject to “unjustified restrictions and conditions” which prevent them from freely choosing the search engines and browsers installed on their devices. Related Google on the offensive in EU antitrust case, says allegations don’t ‘fit the reality’ Google , Facebook among companies to fall under strict new EU privacy laws for consumer data In total, the Commission has brought three antitrust cases against Google in the past two years: In addition to the Android case, the Commission has alleged the company prioritized its Google Shopping service in search results and blocked competitors in search advertising on its AdSense platform. If the allegations levelled by the European Commission at Google are upheld, the company could be fined up to US$7.4 billion. Canada’s Competition Bureau closed its own investigation into Google last April after finding that the company did not use its market position to disadvantage competitors. The investigation, launched in 2013, determined that Google previously used anti‑competitive clauses in contracts for its online AdWords advertising software, but the company removed those clauses in 2013 and agreed not to reintroduce them in Canada for five years. “The Bureau’s review focused on facts and evidence related to allegations of anti-competitive conduct affecting the Canadian marketplace,” a Competition Bureau spokesperson said. “The Bureau’s conclusions regarding each of the allegations were based upon a careful review of the evidence relevant to the Canadian market, obtained by the Bureau over the course of its investigation.” The spokesperson added that the Bureau “will be closely following developments with respect to Google’s ongoing conduct, including the results from investigations of our international counterparts.” The Heritage department memo expressed concern that small and medium sized Canadian technology companies could be put at a disadvantage by “practices such as pre-installation of operating systems, default search engines and manipulation of search engines,” all areas where the European Commission has argued Google skewed the market against competitors with Android. “Canadian Heritage strives to ensure that Canadian creators have the tools necessary to thrive in today’s digital world,” the department said, but referred questions about the Competition Bureau’s decision to drop its antitrust investigation to the bureau itself. Earlier this week, Google agreed to pay an approximately US$8 million fine for antitrust violations in the Russian mobile market. The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia found the company had abused its dominant position following a complaint by Russian tech company Yandex that accused Google of requiring smartphone manufacturers to pre-install Google Play on their products. Google has strongly objected to the European Commission’s charges. Last fall, the company’s senior vice president and general counsel Kent Walker arguing that “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.” “Android is the most flexible mobile platform out there, balancing the needs of thousands of manufacturers and operators, millions of app developers and more than a billion consumers” he added. “Upsetting this balance would raise prices, hamper innovation, reduce choice and limit competition.” Many of Google’s agreements with smartphone makers require that an initial suite of Google apps come pre-installed on devices, which the company says is what allows it to distribute Android for free and further its investments in the platform. Google’s Play Store, which comes pre-installed on Android, offers users access to over 2 million third-party apps available for download on thousands of mobile devices.

x Search for: April 24, 2017 |   NEWS ARTS LIFE & STYLE OPINIONS SPORTS HUMOUR FEATURE LETTITOR Facebook Twitter Instagram Main menu Skip to content HOME STAFF ABOUT SUBMISSIONS CONTACT Posted on September 8, 2014 by The Other Press Celebrities’ nude photo leak arouses many questions Why I still lack sympathy for leaked nude photos By Elliot Chan, Opinions Editor There was a time when sharing intimate images through digital devices was a big no-no. Sure, it might have been a passionate gesture, but such exchanges have always opened the door for betrayal, whether the subject of the picture wanted to be a pornographic exhibit or not. The scandal earlier this month surrounding Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and other female celebrities was a clear example that the cultural paradigm has changed. The onus is no longer placed on those taking the pictures, rather on those eager to hack networks and go through extreme measures to uncover them—and those who view the pictures afterward. The plea now is for the whole Internet community to restrain from clicking on any link that showcases pornographic images that were posted without consent. While some might choose to boycott those click-baits and smutty online channels, most have already entered keywords into the search engine in hopes of discovering those leaked images. The same way society has deemed it okay to take exposed pictures of oneself or another with little to no consequence, people are also allowed to Google something with little to no consequence. The line—although drawn—is still faint and often-ignored. Having nude pictures of yourself floating around on the Internet is humiliating, no doubt. And hacking into personal accounts is a breach of privacy, which is a crime. Not wanting to victim-blame or anything like that, but if you don’t want naked pictures of yourself on the Internet, perhaps it’s best to just refrain from sending those images initially. Don’t post naked pictures of yourself; that was what I was taught at the dawn of the computer age. What has changed? Why are we lowering the bar for ourselves? Why are we placing the blame on technology such as iCloud and people such as hackers? After all, hackers have always been around, just like muggers, thieves, and other criminals. The Internet is more than a public place to visit now. The Internet is our photo albums, our personal documents, and even our safety deposit boxes. The Internet is how we communicate to our employers, our families, and our loved ones. But we must remember, no matter how zealous we become and how tender the moment is, the Internet is still a public place. Telling hackers to stay out of our personal account is like telling the mugger with a knife aimed at my gut to not rob me. We cannot convince those people. The fact that they have gone to such extreme lengths to uncover private, and sometimes deleted, pictures of celebrities is proof that they are out for more than a casual tug. No angry tweet or Facebook post will convince them that what they are doing is wrong. So what are we share-happy people going to do? Live in constant fear that our private images will end up on a Tumblr feed? Well, at the moment is sure seems like it. All it takes is one share, one drag and drop, or one forwarded message and your intimate image is some stranger’s desktop wallpaper. We know the boundaries of the Internet, yet we still dare to cross them. That is why I have no sympathy for those who take nude pictures of themselves. I also don’t have any sympathy for hackers either, because if you take risks, you’d better handle the consequences yourself.

Robots – What’s inside is valuable and important Posted on April 24, 2017April 21, 2017 by GS Early Views: 1 0 Shares There’s a lot of talk about the coming disruption of the Robot Age. But the thing is, robots are here. They’ve been here for a while now, even though most of us don’t see them on a day to day basis. Finding them may be easier than just looking at an auto production line, which is the standard media example of robotics in action. However, that’s the standard because automation is at the heart of robotics, so a “robot” might not be a machine that looks somewhat human. It may be a complicated machine that can replace what humans have been doing. For example, I recently wrote a couple articles on the transition of dangerous manual labor in the oil and coal industries. Basically, automation is taking over the jobs that used to be the domain of brave workers risking life and limb in a mine or on a rig. For the companies, they now have invested in technologies rather than personnel and those technologies operate rain or shine, with no attitudes and no sick days. These new technologies are essentially robots. Amazon.com’s warehouses are also full of robots doing a complex dance among all the products filling orders and getting them to our door within a day or two after placing the order. The military has been using umanned vehicles in the air, land and sea for more than a decade now. And these machines are getting to the point where they are becoming fully autonomous, able to change course or altitude depending upon the conditions they encounter. So, yes it’s the Robot Age. But underneath the robotics is what’s most important — the brain. How these robots carry out their duties is far more important than what they do, in the end. The brains of these machines are what make them valuable and important. Many years ago, I was talking to a friend about the growing demand in the U.S. military for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). I was looking at iRobot, a company that is better known for its household robotic vacuums, pool cleaners and gutter cleaners. It had begun building UGVs and I thought this would be an interesting play on the sector since it a focused player. A colleague of mine then told me his father, a physics professor at a major university, knew one of the founders. And then he said, “The thing that really makes these unique isn’t their build but their programming.” That was my “Aha!” moment. How to program these robots to figure things out on the fly was what set them apart. And that hasn’t changed. What has changed however, is that processing power has increased significantly so these machines can now process much more information, much more quickly. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. Building a self-aware machine has long been a theme of science fiction. But now it’s much closer to science fact. Computers can now read, talk, play games, give directions (and adapt those directions if you miss your turn) and recognize people by their voices. I got a Google Assistant for Christmas. I usually use it as a timer, or to check the weather or settle some disputed trivia among family members. But it has other more complex tools as well. I can ask it what my day looks like and it will assimilate information from a number of different places to tell me about the weather, my schedule, traffic, curated news, etc. And now, Google has just upgraded the Assistant’s brain to recognize different voices and match them to separate accounts. Nowadays that doesn’t sound too earth shattering… but given this is a $100 device, that kind of technology is pretty stunning. AI is what is powering the Robot Age. It behind driverless cars and the Internet of Things (IoT). IBM is using its AI, Watson to do taxes for H&R Block customers. It’s not coming, it’s here. How to play AI Your best choices for getting a toe — or foot — into this water is to stick with the big players that are making it happen at the fundamental levels. For example, Intel missed the big move to mobile, but it’s redoubled its efforts in AI and the Internet of Things. It has the advantage of being able to deploy huge amounts of chips that are reliable and state of the art. Smaller players may have more interesting designs or abilities but they can’t scale up as reliably, so they will have trouble finding enough customers to grow. No doubt some will succeed, but Intel won’t be left begging. And it’s already making a very successful transition out of the desktop and traditional server markets and into the new sectors. On the implementation side, look to Amazon. It has its hands in just about everything at this point, but automation is at the foundation of its business. AI is going to be a key factor in taking this efficiency to the next level. And if you’re still looking for a smaller company that may have some leverage growth, look at iRobot or AeroVironment. Both have been pioneers of the Robot Age and have deep and loyal roots on the military and homeland security side of things. As border security becomes a bigger issue these firms will be winners.

Companies like Google offer emotional intelligence courses for employees. General Mills has a meditation room in every building on its corporate campus. And even buttoned-up Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock are teaching meditation on the job." The Atlantic: Corporations' Newest Productivity Hack: Meditation — "Long before Google was teaching emotional intelligence courses in Mountain View, Monsanto, of all companies, tried mindfulness. They had a very progressive CEO for a moment there, who had a personal interest in this practice. He brought in a very skilled and experienced teacher named Mirabai Bush, and they began teaching mindfulness to the executives of the company." Harvard Business Review: Mindfulness Can Literally Change Your Brain — "Neuroscientists have shown that practicing mindfulness affects brain areas related to perception, body awareness, pain tolerance, emotion regulation, introspection, complex thinking, and sense of self. While more research is needed to document these changes over time and to understand underlying mechanisms, the converging evidence is compelling." This program airs on April 24, 2017.

Four teams competed to analyze, compile, and present an amount of data in an effective manner. A graduate team — self-titled “The Visards” — won the award for Best in Show for their work over the weekend. A member of the winning team, Eswar Damraju, spoke highly of the event. “It was good experience to see how the industry uses large data sets,” he said. DataFest is nationally sponsored by the American Statistical Association and Google, and made its first appearance at UNM over the weekend. The event, which began on Friday and concluded Sunday afternoon, was a concrete way for students to use classroom skills in the real world. Practicing skills learned by professors, participants received large amounts of data from businesses sponsoring the event. From there, students used statistical programs to organize, analyze, and present the information. Participants vied to win one of three categories: Best in Show, Best Use of External Data and Best Visualization. Participants made presentations to a panel of judges who awarded the participants. Graduate and undergraduate students from engineering, math, computer science, statistics, and the social sciences participated in the event. Though the weekend ended with one winner, all participants went home with an accomplishment, said Erik Erhardt, an associate statistics professor and organizer of DataFest. “Numerous students showcased their statistical skill during the event and simultaneously developed contacts with employers that have led to offers of full-time employment,” Erhardt said. He pointed out that prospective employers will be impressed to see a qualification like DataFest on any applicant’s resume. “It was a good opportunity to explore new tools,” said participant Roger Silva. “I wanted to see some examples of real-world applications of data.” Patrick DeBonies, another participant and member of the only undergraduate team, said DataFest was a fun challenge. “To get the millions of observations companies make and tell our own story was fun. There was a creative side to it,” he said. Erhardt said he enjoyed seeing the teamwork students displayed. “I love seeing groups of students work together to solve a very hard problem,” he said. “It’s a very practical skill. Problems these days are too complicated to solve on your own.” DataFest began in 2011 and was first hosted by University of California, Los Angeles. The competition quickly spread across the nation. In 2017 there are over 30 events with 40 universities participating. Many renowned universities like Columbia, Duke and Yale have participated in DataFest, which will continue through May 7. In past years data microlending firms, online dating companies and other entrepreneurial sites have provided data for analysis. For the first competition participants received 10 million arrest records provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. Data has sinse been provided by microlending sites, online dating services, and data management providers. Big company names like eHarmony.com, Edmonds.com and TicketMaster have also provided data for participants to analyze. Though in its first year at UNM, Erhardt and the 2017 participants hope DataFest can grow into something larger next year.

The warmth of its people also helped convince a couple of retired American journalists to settle down there. Photo: Don Lindley Ten cities in 37 days, that was the plan. My husband, Don, retired from the newspaper business, and we lost no time pursuing a move to Italy, our favorite European destination. We headed for the region of Puglia (or Apulia) in the southeast, and Sicily—the only places with enough sun and sea for our tastes—to find the perfect place to live. On the way from the whitewashed hill town of Ostuni to the chic, seaside city of Trani, we stopped for lunch in Monopoli, on the Adriatic coast. Suddenly there were 11 cities on our list. Share Your Story If you have retired abroad and are interested in writing a column about your experience, you can write to us at reports@wsj.com Despite the luminous Baroque architecture of Lecce, the sumptuous Venetian influence in Siracusa, the beachy, laid-back beauty of Trapani, we couldn’t get that simple lunch in Monopoli out of our minds. We parked in the large main square and watched men play cards under the oaks. Then we strolled through the evocative medieval old town to the working port, where we, two career journalists and ardent travelers, took our first-ever selfie. We noticed how residents greeted each other with the double-cheek kiss and took their leave with an embrace. We were charmed by the colorful fishing boats and the cafe life in the adjacent piazza. (The coffee break is deeply ingrained in Italian culture and the espresso is marvelous.) And we loved the sense of pride and contentment locals took in their town. A waiter told us with some pique that Monopoli was certainly not a suburb of nearby Bari, Puglia’s largest city.

You Always Wanted to Learn an Instrument. It’s Time. You can guess the rest. Back in the U.S., we stored nearly everything we own and crossed the Atlantic for good, with seven suitcases, two Siamese cats and one helpful nephew. We moved into the medieval center of Monopoli and rented an apartment in a 15th-century building with arched stone ceilings and modern art. We stand on our balcony and watch waves of people beneath our feet as they make their way to the imposing Spanish castle nearby. The rhythm of the day Don and I adapted to retirement and the Italian lifestyle with enthusiasm. OK, except for breakfast. Italians have little more than an espresso and a cornetto (think croissant, but not as buttery). I need more and usually prepare eggs, French toast or oatmeal before we head to the gym or out for an energetic walk. We run errands before the 1 to 5 p.m. lunch break, which brings the town to a standstill as everyone adjourns home or to a trattoria. We enjoyed this custom as tourists—who doesn’t love a long lunch with wine and a nap?—but find it constricting as residents. So we fill what we call the “hours of death” with language lessons, calls to the U.S. to take care of personal business, and yes, an occasional glass of wine followed by a snooze. Fresh fish, courtesy of the local “gladiators of the sea,” are just one of the culinary delights Monopoli has to offer. Photo: Don Lindley Monopoli springs back to life in the evening, with stores and offices staying open until 8 p.m. (If you ever wondered why Southern Europeans dine so late, it’s because they work so late.) We like to join the ritual evening stroll, the moving chat session that finds everyone from grandfathers and babies to teenagers and businesspeople coursing through the main piazza and funneling into the atmospheric old town. We might stop for a glass of wine or meet our Italian friends for pizza and beer. Journal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music. We left our cars along with our former life. We walk everywhere—Monopoli is thankfully compact—and we prefer it, except in bad weather. We notice more, like when the carousel rides in the square changed from fanciful unicorns to burly trucks, or the lines forming outside the seafood shop when sea urchins, a local delicacy, come in. The food is marvelous, from freshly caught fish to just-picked fennel, but shopping is reminiscent of an earlier era in the States. We stop at the butcher for rotisserie chicken, the bakery for bread, a produce vendor for fruit and vegetables, the deli for salami and the seafood store for clams. It’s like an open-air market, only more spread out. We mostly cook in, but adore going out for the week’s most important meal, Sunday lunch. Extended families crowd into restaurants wearing their furs and finery and sit 20 to a table, grandma at one end, the new baby at the other. The meal starts with raw seafood, proceeds to pasta, continues with an entree and ends three hours on with gelato and a liqueur. In the hubbub leading up to the outing, Monopolitani wish each other a good lunch. Ours is a still life, happy as we are to have left behind frenetic careers. We are content to enjoy the measured pace Monopoli offers, walking along the Adriatic, attending local festivals, watching the fishing boats unload, and always having dinner together. Friends smooth the way We’ve lived here a year now, and we love it. But if there has been one constant frustration, it is the insanely maddening bureaucracy. Did I mention the utter inability of the Italian consulate in Miami to tell us what was necessary to apply for a visa, or the subsequent five weeks it took us to collect the documents? Did I tell you that you must apply in person?We frequently vacationed in Italy, so we had an inkling what we were in for there. But we couldn’t have known the authorities would require us both to fill out a 16-page form, in Italian, to apply for the permit necessary for a long-term stay. We couldn’t have known we would be turned away at first because our U.S. financial documents were not in Italian, nor that the Italian government wouldn’t approve our stay until the very day our visa expired, giving us just six weeks before we had to reapply for permission to stay another year. But a funny thing happened on the way to the Bari immigration office. Our lovely landlord spent hours helping us fill out the form. Her husband drove us to Bari and cajoled officials to see us promptly. (The crowd outside was daunting, much less the line inside.) This year, authorities required yet another form, and Maria, our magician of an Italian tutor, and her fiancé whisked us off to the proper office and sweet-talked the clerk into speeding our renewal. The kindnesses don’t stop coming. Maria shared not just her contacts, but also her friends, and they’ve welcomed us warmly. They invite us to parties and shower us with favors like escorting us to the tailor or helping us register for Italian health care. We made friends with the staff at the bed-and-breakfast next door because we go to them so often for help. They lent us dishes for Thanksgiving dinner, accepted our packages while we were away and faxed Don a copy of his passport when he left it behind. Happily settling in To live in Puglia is to live out of time. The traditions of an ancient society remain, from families staying in place to fishing boats pulling into the harbor each evening. Life is built on personal relationships. Shopkeepers greet you by name. The same priest who confirms a child will likely preside at her wedding. THINKING OF RETIRING IN... Ecuador: More than an Escape from the Cold (November 2016) Starting Over in Montevideo, Uruguay (March 2016) Couple Builds a House in the Andes (November 2015) Congenial and Cultural Living in Amsterdam (January 2015) Moving to a Farmhouse in France's Perigord (October 2012) And it all comes at a reasonable price. A two-bedroom apartment rents for about $650 to $1,300 a month, while home prices begin at about $165,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home of about 1,200 square feet in town. Monthly cellphone service starts at about $10, internet service at about $20. Good public health care is mostly free if you’re a legal resident, with fees for some examinations, like $33 for an MRI or $50 for a mammogram. Private doctors are more expensive but also more available and still reasonable by U.S. standards. As much as we enjoy our days in Monopoli, we enjoy traveling, too. If we’re even slightly bored (Monopoli is a city of 50,000 with no major sights), we hop a train to a town we haven’t discovered. We can’t resist returning to beloved Italian destinations like Rome, Venice and the Chianti region, but we have visited Spain and Malta, too. Croatia and the Czech Republic are in our sights this year. We intend to rent a car to explore the nooks and crannies of Puglia, an unspoiled land filled with impressive hill towns, ancient castles and hidden beaches. But the train system is surprisingly efficient. It is not, however, always modern. On one trip a man placed his foot on the armrest of the opposite seat and it promptly fell off. “Ah, Italia,” he said, shrugging, then reaffixed it. If we’ve had a disappointment, it’s our inability to grasp the language, even with twice-weekly lessons. We find that most Monopolitani are reluctant to speak English, despite years of it in school. So Don and I struggle along, giving it our best shot and keeping Google translator at hand. Yet, Puglia casts her spell. When we first arrived, we joked that Don would end up joining the old guys in the square for daily cards and I would linger with the ladies near the children’s rides. Now, that seems a pleasant fate.

Cars have only become connected to the internet in the last few years, but sensors to support autonomous driving capabilities and smart infotainment consoles are contributing to an influx of data that the auto industry has never seen before. Big Data is poised to grow even more as automakers pursue fully self-driving vehicles and the government preps to mandate vehicle-to-vehicle communication, allowing future cars to talk with each other while driving. McKinsey & Co. predicts car data could become a $750 billion industry by 2030. So it’s no wonder everyone wants a slice of the pie. "The emergence of new business models and changes in existing ones will not only unlock new customer segments, but will also attract industry newcomers," McKinsey & Co. wrote in its report. "Traditional car manufacturers will be joined by content/service providers, end-to-end mobility providers, infrastructure providers, and insurers in the competition for the connected customer as new services and business models will allow them to access customers in the car and target this new value pool." That’s where Otonomo comes in. Founded in 2015, Otonomo uses a cloud solution to collect data, organize it, and sell it to third parties. The startup says it works with 9 major automakers and has a partnership with Mercedes' parent company Daimler, but declined to name the other carmakers using its service. The startup has raised $40 million in total funding and boasts Steve Girsky, former vice chairman and board member of General Motors, as a backer. "Google and Apple are the best in the world at monetizing data. They want to do it also in the car and the car guys understand it," Otonomo CEO and co-founder Ben Volkow told Business Insider. "[Automakers] see us as a strategic partner to help play the same game." Otonomo has 70 partners buying up the data, ranging from players in the retail space and insurance industry, Volkow said. More than 1 million cars on the road are already connected to the Otonomo platform, and that number will rise to 5 million by the end of 2017. The startup splits whatever it makes selling the data with the the automaker that supplies it. Volkow declined to say exactly how much Otonomo takes away, but said it’s less than half. The fate of privacy © Provided by Business Insider Inc us dot tests v2v technology US DOTOtonomo is already selling vehicle owners' data, but questions of privacy still remain as cars are set to collect more data going forward. Currently, Otonomo adheres to the Driver Privacy Act of 2015 that states all data collected by a vehicle is the property of the owner or lessee of that vehicle unless the owner gives explicit consent to share it. What drivers may not realize is that they have consented to hand over that data simply by agreeing to the terms and services of their infotainment consoles, like Daimler's COMMAND or General Motors' OnStar. The McKinsey report found vehicle owners are pretty evenly divided when it comes to sharing this kind of information. Of the 3,184 respondents surveyed, 55% said they would allow it and 24% said they would not allow it under any circumstances. The other 21% said they would share data that helped improve the car’s product, under the condition it would not be sold to third parties. That means 45% of people surveyed were opposed to their data being sold to third parties. How consumers opt in and out of privacy standards may change. The government is looking to mandate V2V communication, allowing cars to communicate about traffic patterns and congestion in the ultimate hope of cutting down accidents. But as mentioned earlier, that’s going to result in entirely new streams of data being shared and collected. The Federal Trade Commission and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will discuss the privacy and security issues related to V2V on June 28. (The public comment period on the topic closed Thursday.) The government will also have to address consumer privacy when it comes to self-driving vehicles. NHTSA released federal guidelines for the vehicles in September that include a safety assessment for consumer privacy, but has yet to propose regulations. Still, there may be instances where consumers want to share certain kinds of data, similar to how people use their smartphones today. For example, drivers may elect to share their location to get alerts about open parking spots nearby. Volkow mentioned other ways an open data platform could improve the driving experience. Otonomo can monitor everything from tire pressure to battery life, meaning it can inform a driver they need to see a mechanic before a car breaks down. For self-driving cars, fleet managers could receive alerts if there's problem and program the car to drive back to its home base for further evaluation. "[Car manufacturers] will need to give you the visibility somehow to see what is being done with your data and how to control it," Volkow said. "But I think in many places there’s a strong motivation for you to give it."  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

NEW DELHI: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has told Indian agencies that the US could share with India "encrypted data" on the internet and social media platforms pertaining to terror suspects, organisations and other criminals through legal channels. However, how much this would be of help to Indian investigators is difficult to say as decrypting the evidence — like chats between terrorists — will be a tough and time consuming exercise. The Indian government and agencies have time and again told American authorities that they failed to get timely evidence from the "digital space" as a large number of social media platforms — including websites and internet-based messaging applications like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google and YouTube — had their servers in the US. The National Investigation Agency's top brass, during a meeting with FBI deputy director Andrew G McCabe earlier this month in New Delhi, said getting "digital evidence" quickly could really help in counter-terrorism and counter-radicalisation efforts. In several cases registered by the NIA against Islamic State-inspired Indian youngsters, the agency approached the US seeking details about their chats, emails or coded conversations over messaging platforms. Both countries have signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) for sharing evidence through proper court procedures. McCabe told NIA officials that even US authorities had to approach the court for sharing data of private internet service providers with other countries. Officials said terrorists these days keep track of mobile-based application services which provide end-to-end encryption and use them to discuss targets, recruitment plans, travel details or to share propaganda material. Usually, sources said, the US is very helpful in sharing details on terrorists and terror outfits, but it is a time consuming process. The US recently shared thousands of internet-based conversations between Jaish-e-Muhammed members involved in the Pathankot airbase attack, which helped NIA build a strong case against Maulana Masood Azhar.

Reuters/Kacper Pempel An Israeli start-up company, Otonomo, was competing with Google and Apple in monetising personal data within the car industry.  These companies were capitalising on the fact that traditional cars become repositories of personal data. Car data exchange platform Otonomo was founded in 2015 that aimed to collect data, to organise it and to sell it to third parties. It has raised US$40 million (AU$52 million) in total funding with General Motors as its backer. The start-up company has partnered with 70 companies in the retail and insurance industry that bought up the data. The company has also partnered with nine major automakers including Daimler. The company was expecting at the end of 2017 that the number of cars connected to the Otonomo platform would rise up to five million. Privacy issues were still in question as cars were set to collect more data going forward. As of the moment, the company maintained the privacy of the data through the Driver Privacy Act of 2015. It stated that all the data collected by a vehicle remained in the ownership of the vehicle's owner or the lessee. The data could be transferred only if the owner gave explicit consent to share it. The McKinsey report found that vehicle owners were divided when it comes to sharing data. According to the report, among the 3,184 respondents who took the survey, 55 percent said they would allow it and 24 percent said they would not allow it even under any circumstance. Twenty-one percent of the respondents said that they would share data that helped improve the car's product but it should not be sold to third parties. The report revealed that 45 percent of people surveyed did not agree on selling data to third parties. Otonomo platform features Multi-layered security is one of the features of the car exchange platform. It comes with strong encryption, layer 7 firewall, data anonymisation and field variations. It offered simplified data access where service providers could subscribe to data bundles and receive aggregated anonymised data. It could also receive data from specific car owners and they could get reports, analytics and notifications tailored to their specific needs. The company has created a patented pending technology that would keep the data private even though it would undergo a compromising transit of data.  Rich and intuitive API is another feature of the platform were car OEMs, service providers and market managers all have their own API interface. This feature would enable comprehensive access to Otonomo's data exchange.

Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting feast in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index  delivering quarterly scorecards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The lineup accounts for around 40 per cent of the benchmark index’s value, or more than $7.7 trillion, and includes big names like Google’s parent Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp. The onslaught could keep US stock investors’ focus largely on earnings next week even as the world’s attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere. “That would be our hope,” said Joe Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. “A lot of people looked at this market and said it was the result of the Trump bump or the Hillary relief rally,” while earnings have been rebounding, he said. “The faster earnings growth is under-appreciated by investors.” Many strategists have attributed the 10 per cent rally in the S&P 500 since Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the November 8 US presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge. The gains drove market valuations recently to their highest since 2004, even with little progress in Washington on the fiscal policy front. Meanwhile, other anxiety-provoking events have grabbed headlines, including unsettling relations with North Korea and this weekend’s election in France, which has a bearing on the country’s membership in the European Union and its currency, the euro. Upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley and other banks so far this reporting period cushioned those geopolitical worries, helping push the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent this week, its best such performance in two months. Shares of smaller companies did even better, with S&P’s benchmark indexes for small  and mid-cap stocks notching their best weeks of 2017, with gains of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Expectations for the quarter’s profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the last week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 per cent from 10.4 per cent, a more than 7 per cent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. “This week definitely has proven that the Street likes earnings — it’s controllable, it’s US,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The reason for the slew of reports next week is anyone’s guess, Silverblatt said, although recent holidays possibly played a role. Passover, Good Friday and Easter all fell in the previous weeks, which may have prompted some companies that typically report earlier to delay a week. Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago, Silverblatt said. Next week’s rush will represent a 15 per cent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year. Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet, Amazon, Intel Corp, Microsoft and Starbucks Corp. That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, Silverblatt said, which is also the final trading day of April. US STOCKS: US stocks dipped on Friday as investors were cautious ahead of the first round of the closely contested French presidential election, but the S&P 500 managed to notch its first weekly gain in three. The first round of France’s presidential election may be too close to call when polls close on Sunday because initial projections will not be available as early as in the past, pollsters and their watchdog said. Most polls see centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen qualifying on Sunday for a May 7 runoff, but conservative Francois Fillon and leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon are not far behind and within the margin of error. “Nobody is taking anything for granted after the big swing and miss in Britain and the big swing and a miss here,” said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “I don’t think anyone wants to stick their neck out for this one.” US President Donald Trump said he would have a major tax reform announcement on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.95 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 20,547.76, the S&P 500 lost 7.15 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 2,348.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.26 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 5,910.52. The Dow rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P gained 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.8 per cent in what was the first weekly gain for the top indexes over the last three weeks. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Trump’s ‘big announcement’ on tax to be broad principles China’s quota threat charges up electric car market → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Tough new penalties come into force from tomorrow Agreement for RO 265m Nakheel ITC project to be signed today Call for benefiting from tourism sector Bid to attract Russian tourists to Sultanate Read More ...

 Here's the latest trick hackers are using to hide their phishing URLs Alex Hern, The Guardian Apr. 23, 2017, 7:02 PM 5,346 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tomohiro Ohsumi / Stringer / Getty Images Here’s a challenge for you: you click on a link in your email, and find yourself at the website https://аррӏе.com. Your browser shows the green padlock icon, confirming it’s a secure connection; and it says “Secure” next to it, for added reassurance. And yet, you’ve been phished. Do you know how? The answer is in that URL. It may look like it reads “apple”, but that’s actually a bunch of Cyrillic characters: A, Er, Er, Palochka, Ie. The security certificate is real enough, but all it confirms is that you have a secure connection to аррӏе.com – which tells you nothing about whether you’re connected to a legitimate site or not. The proof-of-concept domain was put together by Xudong Zheng, a security researcher who wanted to demonstrate the problem with the way domain names can be registered and displayed. For a long time, domain names could only be written in Latin characters without diacritics, but since 1998 it’s actually been possible to write them in other alphabets too. That’s useful if you want to register a domain name in Chinese or Arabic script, or even just correctly spelled French or German – anything that can be represented with the Unicode standard can be registered, even emoji – but it’s also opened up a whole new avenue of misdirection for malicious actors to take advantage of, by finding characters in other alphabets which look similar to Latin ones. “From a security perspective, Unicode domains can be problematic because many Unicode characters are difficult to distinguish from common ASCII characters,” Zheng writes. “It is possible to register domains such as ‘xn--pple-43d.com’, which is equivalent to ‘аpple.com’. It may not be obvious at first glance, but ‘аpple.com’ uses the Cyrillic ‘а’ (U+0430) rather than the ASCII “a” (U+0041). This is known as a homograph attack.” Some browsers will keep an eye out for such tricks, and display the underlying domain name if they sense mischief. A common approach is to reject any domain name containing multiple alphabets. But that doesn’t work if the whole thing is written in the same alphabet Sean Gallup/Getty Images Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Edge both still spot that Zheng’s spoof domain is a fraud, but Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox don’t, instead displaying the Cyrillic domain name. And though it may be obvious in the Guardian’s font that something’s up, the sans serif typeface used as standard by those browsers leave the two indistinguishable. Zheng says: “This bug was reported to Chrome and Firefox on January 20, 2017…The Chrome team has since decided to include the fix in Chrome 58, which should be available around April 25.” Mozilla, however, declined to fix it, arguing that it’s Apple’s problem to solve: “it is sadly the responsibility of domain owners to check for whole-script homographs and register them”. Google didn’t comment beyond referring to Zheng’s blogpost, and Mozilla didn’t comment at publication time but a spokesperson later said: “We continue to investigate ways to further address visual spoofing attacks, which are complex to fix with technology just in the browser alone.” Itsik Mantin, director of security research at Imperva, said that common advice to web users falls down when such simple attacks work. “In order to protect website users, forcing them to use strong passwords and to replace them frequently is insufficient, since in this case it would be completely ineffective to prevent the attack. Instead, he said, a better approach begins by assuming that phishing attacks will succeed: “Site administrators should assume that the credentials of some of their users were stolen (which in almost 100% of the cases will be true), and take adequate measures to identify account takeover, like irregular device, irregular geo-location or abnormal activity in the account.” Zheng himself offers advice to users: use a password manager, and try and spot phishing attacks before you click on any links. “In general, users must be very careful and pay attention to the URL when entering personal information. Until this is fixed, users should manually type the URL or navigate to the site via a search engine when in doubt.” SEE ALSO: Hackers are using a devilishly clever fake email attachment scam to break into people's accounts NOW WATCH: People are outraged by this shocking video showing a passenger forcibly dragged off a United Airlines plane Loading video...

Many of the stores that once filled the malls of America have become "zombies," while online retailers capture ever more of the most valuable consumers -- the young and affluent. Continue Reading Below Legacy retailers are trying to play catch-up, but they're saddled by huge fixed costs, investors who prefer dividends to innovations, and CEOs incentivized to focus on the next quarter, not the next decade. It's only a matter of time before Amazon.com's army of physical retail formats turn into an existential threat to everyone from Mom and Pop to Kroger and Wal-Mart. That doesn't mean retailers are taking this lying down. As online brands begin to build physical shops, the old guard is taking notes -- and in many cases, writing checks. Wal-Mart, for example, has been on an acquisition binge of late. It's now in talks to buy men's clothier Bonobos for $300 million. After surveying analysts and CEOs, I learned the three biggest lessons physical retailers are grappling with as they face this rocky transition. Data is King When I asked Target, Walgreens and grocery chain Giant Food about loyalty programs and the fate of customers' purchasing data -- which is the in-store equivalent of your web browsing history -- they all declined to comment. Why so cagey? Perhaps because of the uproar that occurred when Target sent coupons for baby clothes and cribs to the home of a teenage girl, alerting her family she was pregnant, says Michelle Evans, an analyst at consumer research firm Euromonitor. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Data has been a vital part of Amazon's retail revolution, just as it was with Netflix's media revolution and Google and Facebook's advertising revolution. For brick-and-mortar retailers, purchasing data doesn't just help them compete with online adversaries; it has also become an alternate revenue source when profit margins are razor thin. For example, Unilever might buy store sales data to figure out which products are in high demand and when people buy them. (Ms. Evans says that when retailers sell data, it's anonymized and not linked to individual consumers.) Physical retailers must catch up to online retailers in collecting rich data without making it feel so intrusive. Why, exactly, does my grocery store need my phone number? Personalization + Automation = Profits There's a debate in the auto industry: Can Tesla get good at making cars faster than Ford, General Motors and Toyota can get good at making self-driving electric vehicles? The same applies to retail: Can physical retailers build intimate digital relationships with their customers -- and use that data to update their stores -- faster than online-first retailers can learn how to lease property, handle inventory and manage retail workers? Online retailers know what's popular, and how customers who like one item tend to like certain others. So Amazon's physical bookstores can put out fewer books with more prominently displayed covers. Bonobos doesn't even sell clothes in its stores, which it calls "guideshops." Instead, customers go there to try clothes on, and their selections are delivered through the company's existing e-commerce system. Amazon's upcoming Go convenience stores, selling groceries and meal kits, don't even require cashiers. That's the sort of automation that could position Amazon to reap margins -- or slash prices -- to a degree unprecedented for retailers in traditionally low-margin categories like food and packaged goods. While online retailers are accustomed to updating inventory and prices by the hour, physical retailers simply don't have the data or the systems to keep up, and tend to buy and stock on cycles as long as a year, says George Faigen, a retail consultant at Oliver Wyman. Some legacy retailers are getting around this by teaming up with online players. Target stocks men's shaving supplies from not one but two online upstarts, Harry's and Bevel. Target has said that, as a result, more customers are coming in to buy razors, increasing the sales of every brand on that aisle -- even good old Gillette. Retailers have long relied on manufacturers to drive customers to stores by marketing their goods and even managing in-store displays. The difference is this: In the past, new brands had to persuade store buyers to dole out precious shelf space; now the brands can prove themselves online first. Legacy Tech Won't Cut It Perhaps the biggest challenge for existing retailers, says Euromonitor's Ms. Evans, is finding the money to transition to this hybrid online-offline model. While Target has announced it will spend $7 billion over the next three years to revamp its stores, investors fled the stock in February after Target reported 2017 profits might be 25% less than expected. When Warby Parker, the online eyeglasses retailer, set out to launch stores across the U.S., the company looked for in-store sales software that could integrate with its existing e-commerce systems. It couldn't find a system up to the task, so it built one from scratch. These kinds of systems allow salespeople to know what customers have bought both online and off, and what they might be nudged toward on that day. "We call it the 'point of everything' system," says David Gilboa, co-founder and co-chief executive. Having this much customer knowledge available instantly is critical, but it's precisely what existing retailers struggle with, Mr. Faigen says. Even Amazon is experiencing brick-and-mortar difficulties. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Go stores would be delayed because of kinks in the point-of-sale software system. Andy Katz-Mayfield, co-founder and co-chief executive of Harry's, is skeptical that traditional retailers like Wal-Mart can make the leap, even if they invest heavily in technology. The problem, he says, is that selling online isn't just about taking orders through a website. Companies that succeed are good at selling direct to consumers -- building technology from the ground up, integrating teams skilled at navigating online marketing's ever-shifting terrain and managing the experience through fulfillment and delivery, Mr. Katz-Mayfield says. That e-commerce startups are so confident about their own future doesn't mean they are right about the fate of traditional retailers, however. A report from Merrill Lynch argues Wal-Mart is embarking on a period of 20% to 30% growth for its e-commerce business. A spokesman for the company said that in addition to acquisitions, the company is focused on growing its e-commerce business organically. It isn't hard to picture today's e-commerce companies becoming brick-and-mortar retailers. It's harder to bet on traditional retailers becoming as tech savvy as their e-competition.

Still a long way off the often mooted all-Apple ‘iCar’ that has been suggested previously, Business Insider reveals instead that the unlikely combination of a Lexus RX 450h and a Logitech video gaming wheel and pedal set mark Apple’s first step into vehicle control systems. As cartoonish as it sounds, the Apple Autonomous System is the genesis of a potential multi-billion dollar revenue stream for Apple, and will help bring the company up to speed with Google’s Waymo self-driving program, as well as OEM systems from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and other carmakers. Californian law states that for vehicles to be tested on public roads under its permit program a human driver must be in the vehicle, and must be able to assume control of the vehicle at any stage, overriding the autonomous system. Lexus RX 450h Training documents provided to Apple staff indicate potential system failures like the car not following lane markings, not following its indicated direction, or unable to maintain its speed - and the recommended course of action, usually assuming control of steering or braking to assume manual control. Images provided with the documents show that rather than using the factory installed (and physically connected) steering wheel and brake pedal, Apple has fitted a second steering wheel and pedal set in the back seat, from computer peripheral supplier Logitech, tapping into the by-wire driving systems developed by Apple, not Lexus. The permit application documents deal with the safety aspects and rules of human intervention, but don’t divulge technical details of Apple’s systems, sensors, connectivity, or other changes to the Lexus vehicles nominated for the trial fleet. Further details about Apple’s automotive program, including the likelihood of an Apple-branded car or EV are still (as is so often the case from the tech giant) shrouded in mystery, but with public testing about to occur more details of Apple’s plan are sure to follow in short order.

Major railway stations will soon have giant digital screens to showcase real-time passenger information and also help the national transporter monetise the opportunity through digital advertising. The Rail Display Network (RDN) is seen as a crucial platform for the transporter to raise funds from non-ticketing sources and strengthen the interface with passengers. Several top global firms such as Google are keen to take part in the project and help design the advertising technology. Microsoft and Reliance have also shown interest, sources said. “This is expected to be the biggest advertising platform outside television,” said an official who did not wish to be named. To begin with, the plan is to install RDN at around 400 major stations (A category). The tender is likely to be awarded by May. Large and small digital screens are already functioning at Old Delhi, Gorakhpur, Gwalior and Varanasi as railways had earlier awarded the proof of concept (PoC) contract for RDN at these stations. Eventually, the proposal is to install about two lakh digital display screens at 2,175 railway stations across the country, at the most visible locations. The screens will be ‘cloud-controlled’, which will allow effective monitoring of the content. Railtel, a state-run undertaking under the railways, will provide the optical fibre cable network as well as its expertise for other technical requirements to roll out the network.

Johnson) This post discusses “Success Failure,” the April 23 episode of “Silicon Valley.” “Silicon Valley” has always been masterfully funny about the highly specific challenges involved in getting a tech business off the ground. The reason I decided to cover the show on a weekly basis in its fourth season, though, is that the series takes a step up intellectually this year. It’s no longer merely about the challenges of being a little guy with a good idea trying to go out on your own in a town full of skittish, shortsighted venture capitalists and huge conglomerates such as Hooli, the series’ Google stand-in. As Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) finally acknowledges the true scope of his ambition, “Silicon Valley” has become a series about how an industry that prides itself on ushering the future has, in fact, oriented itself to encourage the development of the trivial instead of the truly revolutionary. That becomes clear in the transition between two scenes relatively early in the episode. Richard finds himself procrastinating instead of writing the code he’s supposed to put together to support Dinesh’s (Kumail Nanjiani) Piper Chat, the latest application of Richard’s breakthrough from the show’s first season. “I think we should be doing a little bit more with this revolutionary compression algorithm than passable video chat,” he grumbles in the living room of the grubby group house where he lives and work. Meanwhile, Richard’s former employer, Hooli chief Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) is sitting on a private jet, toasting Jack Barker (Stephen Tobolowsky), who wanted to turn Richard’s insight into yet another rack-mountable server. “Here’s to you, Jack,” Gavin declares. “And to your Hooli Endframe Box becoming the most successful American data storage device to ever be engineered in China.” “Silicon Valley” doesn’t have to say so explicitly, but the message is clear: Is that it? Is this what accomplishment looks like? Is the only thing we can find to celebrate something that needs to be pared down by three separate qualifiers to count as unique? If this is what the people who claim to be radically transforming our world are doing, are we all just doomed? The series has always picked out an extremely careful path between suggesting that the tech industry’s tendency to hype itself is just complete and utter nonsense, and arguing that truly transformative ideas can, in fact, come out of the Valley. Part of what’s so funny and effective about “Success Failure” is which characters recognize that Richard might genuinely be on to something remarkable. Monica (Amanda Crew), the sharp analyst at the venture capital firm Raviga who has been demoted because of her faith in Richard, has become skittish with anxiety; she’s reached a point where she would just like Richard to develop a successful project. Russ Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos), the filthy-mouthed, self-absorbed tycoon who made his pile in Internet radio and still fancies himself a visionary even though everyone sees him as a joke, turns out to have the ludicrous self-confidence necessary to see the radically decentralized Internet that Richard dreams of as a plausible and exciting idea.* Jared (Zach Woods), who left Hooli because he saw the early potential in Richard’s algorithm, doesn’t quite understand what Richard is up to, but is hurt when Richard encourages him to go work for Piper Chat, rather than bringing Jared in on Richard’s new endeavor. And Gavin Belson, who has for three seasons harassed Richard out of envy and spite, is now caught up in a feud with Jack to the point that he’s flying his head of security back and forth to China over and over to prove an obscure point about flight times. Episodes such as this are why “Silicon Valley,” which is so brilliantly particular in its critique of this particular set of industries, also has such universal power. As Richard settles in with his cup of coffee and his mostly-blank whiteboard, we’re seeing the loneliness of genius, and also the extent to which that loneliness is more accident than necessity. Adventurers wouldn’t need to strike out boldly from the pack if the pack had the sense to support them — and if they had the sense to accept the help and support for the people who see them as the revolutionaries that they truly are. * Russ’s uproarious rant about why Richard should follow his passion, which turns out to have been inspired in part by conversations with his newly out-of-the-closet grandfather, is the funniest, and most surprising, thing I’ve seen on television so far this year. And in a year when “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is on the air, that’s saying something. opinions act-four Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Among stock investors, this was supposed to be the year the cheapskates beat the big spenders. But in another consensus-confounding turn, value stocks have badly lagged growth shares - just as bond yields have dropped and market volatility has been muted, contrary to the popular predictions. The Russell 1000 Value index - which tracks cheaper, more economically sensitive names - is up a mere 2.1 percent for 2017 to date, dusted by the 9.2 percent surge in the Russell 1000 Growth, which is driven by pricier shares of businesses whose expansion is not as reliant on the broad economic trend. Russell 1000 Value vs. Russell 1000 Growth: (Rising line means value outperforms and vice versa. ) Source: FactSet Remember FANG - that juggernaut foursome of adored tech stocks (Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) that nearly carried the entire market in 2015? That group is up more than 17 percent year to date, versus about 5 percent for the S&P 500. The ratio of the Nasdaq Composite index level to the S&P 500 is now higher than at any time since the tech bubble year of 2000. The iShares Edge U.S. Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM), which rides the stocks showing the most upside persistence, has gained almost 10 percent, while the Deep Value ETF (DVP) - a small, but representative vehicle for extreme bargain hunting - is ahead by less than 3 percent. Utilities, those "safe" stocks commonly viewed as overvalued, are up 6.5 percent, while the S&P Bank ETF (KBE), a favorite of the economic-acceleration and policy-bull crowd, is down 2.5 percent. This growth-stock dominance ended a dramatic, but brief, resurgence of the value style in 2016, most of which occurred after the election and went by the names Trump trade, reflation trade or cyclical rotation. Lindsey Bell, strategist at CFRA, points out that last year saw the widest outperformance by value since 2006. But that year was the last of seven straight years of value leadership, while before 2016, growth shares had paced the market for several years. The failure of cheaper stocks that are tethered to the economic pace and higher interest rates to continue leading the way in 2017 is all about softening growth expectations, ebbing bond yields and dimming hopes for quick fiscal stimulus from Washington. So now the crucial unknowns: Is the market giving investors a chance to reload on value stocks such as banks, industrials and energy names? Have we gone through another now-familiar first-quarter lull in U.S. growth, only to see activity quicken again? Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, is answering yes to the above questions. He says 2017 should still feature the conditions that tend to favor a value tilt. Namely, value does better when GDP and corporate earnings growth are both re-accelerating and when overall equity valuations are above average. As of now, those criteria should be in place for 2017, though right now it's not quite clear that GDP is set to be much faster than last year. It's certainly true that value stocks have had nice, meaty corrections, skimming away foam off the froth following their post-election rally and now stabilizing again. Bank stocks fell a full 10 percent from their all-time high in the past two months, and the Dow Transportation Average dropped 8 percent. So if Treasury yields lift from the low end of their range again and the macro data hold up reasonably well, these areas could well seem ripe for a rebound.
