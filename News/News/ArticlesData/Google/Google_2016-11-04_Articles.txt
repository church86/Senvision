While RCS and SMS will be compatible in some ways, the former standard will allow for iMessage-like features like file transfers, audio messaging, video sharing, conference calling, location sharing and live sketching. Well, it won’t be anywhere near as amazing as Invisible Ink or lasers, but as applied to an interoperable standard, we’ll take it. Over 150 devices on the market currently are capable are supporting the RCS. 58 carriers worldwide will be on the launch pad — in the US, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile have signed onto the new standard. Here’s where the fragmentation begins, though: Google has decided to offer its own cloud servers for RCS — a service it brands as Jibe — and has been able to recruit Sprint to use them to launch its service. Starting next year, all Android phones on the network will come pre-loaded with Google’s Messenger app “as the default SMS and RCS messaging experience.” Some LG and Nexus phones will support RCS chat right now with a Messenger update, now in distribution. Google has been pushing Jibe hard to other carriers and is expecting to nail more deals down soon — the big G gets money from carriers while the carriers don’t have to worry about maintaining their own servers as they’ve done with SMS. In terms of the competitive scene, security and privacy, that’s a ball of yarn within itself. Of course, this drags Mountain View’s approach to messaging on Android into focus as we see Google’s Messenger become just a little more like iMessage and Facebook Messenger just by being a default. Allo, which has the quickest potential to provide way more advanced messaging features in combination with access to service bots like Google Assistant, is arguably trying to cannibalize users from “the default.” And Hangouts? Well, it’s a hot enterprise mess that’s still trying to figure out where to go now. As The Verge‘s Dieter Bohn describes the situation, Messenger is more a play for carriers while Google is attempting to keep itself in the consumer convenience market with Allo. At this point, we doubt consumers are noticing a difference between the two that will make them switch in droves. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images) Print Email Eder Campuzano | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Eder Campuzano | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05, 2016 at 2:20 PM, updated November 05, 2016 at 10:38 PM comments Many Oregon voters have already returned their ballots, but plenty are still filling them out over the weekend just days before they're counted. Those who haven't yet made up their mind in the presidential race may have Googled a thing or two about Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the last full week before Election Day. Thanks to Google Trends, we've been able to take a look at what Beaver State voters searched for in the week leading up to Nov. 8. Here's what we found. As far as the candidates' popularity as raw search terms, Clinton edged Trump out consistently over the last seven days. But when the candidates are taken as topics — say, when Oregonians plugged in queries that were related to either candidate without searching for one or the other specifically — Trump tops Clinton by even wider margins. Google has a nifty tool that tells us the most popular terms paired with the candidates' names as well as which search phrases saw an uptick in queries over the seven-day period. These are some of the more popular Clinton- and Trump-related topics Oregonians searched. Conspiracy theories upon conspiracy theories Both Trump and Clinton are attached to search results that either connect them to conspiracy theories or point searchers to absurd stories about their opponent. One of the most bizarre may be Clinton's disproven connection to a so-called Satanic ritual called "spirit cooking." Right-wing conspiracy sites have relished in taking hacked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta released by WikiLeaks and spinning individual notes into tall tales. The spirit cooking fiasco came about when InfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson drudged up an email that referred to an art installation called "Spirit Cooking" and took it to mean that Clinton participated in food preparation rituals that involved bodily fluids. The note to Podesta — in which Clinton was neither sender nor recipient — was merely an invitation to a dinner in celebration of a Kickstarter campaign for the artist who created an art installation called "Spirit Cooking" in the late '90s. Other fake stories pertaining to the candidates include MSNBC correspondent Chris Matthews endorsing Trump, New York Police preparing to arrest Clinton for pedophilia and that the FBI will indict the Democratic nominee after an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. All of those stories were thoroughly debunked. (Or in the case of the last one, mistakenly reported by Fox News's Bret Baier.) Trump pens One of the stranger breakout searches is for a pen adorned with a plastic Trump head that spits out some of the Republican nominee's favorite quotes. The pen includes such phrases as, "I will be the greatest president that God ever created," "Our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid," and fan favorite, "We will have so much winning if I'm elected that you may get bored with winning." Beyonce Because of course, when Beyonce — in a pantsuit, no less — joins husband Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper for a get-out-the-vote concert, Google is bound to be swarmed by the Bey Hive. There's just no question about it. North Carolina polls The Tar Heel state saw a 4,650 percent increase in Google searches from Oregon in the last week, signaling our curiosity of how the election is going in one of the year's most high-profile swing states. Trump, Russia and illiteracy Alleged ties between Trump and Russian interest also garnered a sizable increase in Google searches over the last week. Much of that is due to reports that the FBI is sitting on information that ties the Republican nominee to interests in Moscow. FBI Director James Comey has reportedly refused to raise suspicion of any connections between Trump and Russia, which has earned him rebuke from Democrats in the wake of an internal investigation into the agency's records division, which allegedly fired off a series of pro-Trump tweets this week. In a less serious turn, the Oct. 31 episode of "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" inspired another popular Google query: Can Donald Trump read? The search term is in all likelihood an attempt by Oregonians to find a segment of Bee's show in which she takes one of Trump's favorite qualifiers — "a lot of people are saying" — and turns it on its head with footage from the Republican nominee's testimony during a recent deposition. The bit pairs video of Trump declining to read legal documents with Bee's commentary to offer the hilarious, probably false theory that the GOP standard-bearer may not be entirely literate. You can watch the segment below. (Warning: It contains some crude language.) It'll be interesting to see how Oregonians' search habits pivot on Nov. 9. With any luck, they'll be more interesting than "who won the presidency?" but less soul-crushing than what was likely the most popular election-related online query in 2000: "What's a chad?" --Eder Campuzano 503.221.4344 @edercampuzano ecampuzano@oregonian.com Most Read About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Back in 1997, internet content consumption primarily took place on desktop and laptop computers, while mobile devices were still at least another decade away before reaching mainstream popularity. With the realization that most people search on Google using mobile devices, the company has begun experimentation with switching to a mobile-first indexing methodology. This will be of particular interest to webmasters, depending upon the configuration of the websites under their management. Google acknowledged the significance of the undertaking, and said: "We understand this is an important shift in our indexing and it’s one we take seriously. We’ll continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale and we’ll ramp up this change when we’re confident that we have a great user experience." While mobile-responsive and dynamic serving sites should not require any changes, Google has made several suggestions for sites that maintain separate markup for mobile and desktop devices. Otherwise, sites optimized only for desktop consumption will continue to be indexed as they are now. For websites that do not currently offer a mobile-optimized experience, the news may inspire webmasters to quickly build and deploy a solution. However, Google recommended a more careful approach, as "a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site."

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Fantastic Beasts Locations Added to Google Maps Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next Fantastic Beasts Locations Added to Google Maps By Jasmin Mohamed 11.05.2016 1 Comment 128 Shares 1 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them finally brings the wizarding world to life here in the United States. Set in 1926 New York City, Newt Scamander inadvertently unleashes terror as he’s passing through on his way back to the UK. North America’s Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry stands in Massachusetts, New York City makes for a much more interesting setting of magical creatures on the loose. The highly anticipated adaption has already been confirmed for at least five films ahead of the opening of the first. Other news surrounding the new franchise includes casting news that Johnny Depp will have a pivotal role in the second feature. But what has really set Fantastic Beasts apart is the emphasis of real world locations, including the sequel taking place in Paris. It’s always fun to see movie studios team up with big companies to provide fans with an interactive experience that extends beyond the theater walls. According to Google (h/t to CB), the WB and Google have done just that with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Pull up Google Maps, and type in “Fantastic Beasts, New York City,” and you’ll see two different locations pop up — The Goldstein Residence and The Blind Pig. Located just two blocks from Washington Square Park in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, regular folk can explore the interior of The Blind Pig; which is a popular speak easy for Witches and Wizards. According to the pub’s description, “Underground speakeasy open to witches & wizards (if they know the secret knock). No-Maj? No Entry.” “No-maj,” is just another term for muggle, or non-magic people. Several blocks up, near Midtown, fans can also explore The Goldstein Residence, home to Porpentina and Queenie Goldstein. The sisters find themselves as allies to Newt as he traverses the city trying to undo the damage he’s done. In their tiny brownstone, we can get a look at their humble yet cozy home that is filled with surprisingly ordinary things. After exploring the world of 1926 New York (and reading reviews, The Blind Pig has an average 5-star rating!), pull up Google on any Android device and have a little fun. If your device is new enough, start with the “Okay, Google,” command, then speak those commands Harry Potter fans will recognize from Charms class. “Lumos” activates the flashlight, “Silencio” puts the phone into do not disturb/mute mode, and “Nox” will shut it down. Notably missing from the map is the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which is located in downtown New York’s famed Woolworth Building. Fantastic Beasts has recently dropped several new TV spots ahead of its main release.

Here are the top things you should know about the growing VR, AR, and MR markets. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 5, 2016 at 3:04PM There's been a lot of buzz in the tech world about virtual-, augmented-, and "mixed"-reality devices. All this talk about different digital "realities" is exciting, but it can also be confusing for investors who haven't been following these next-gen markets. Therefore, let's take a moment to review what those three markets actually consist of. Image source: Getty Images. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) devices immerse a user in a virtual world, which mostly blocks their view and perception of the outside world. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that this market will grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. The hardware market mainly consists of tethered, mobile, and standalone devices. Tethered VR headsets, such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR, must be connected to a high-powered PC or gaming console. These devices generally offer the highest-end VR experiences and track a user's head position with optical sensors and lasers installed in "base stations" around the room. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently revealed several new tethered VR headsets that can track a user's head position by using internal sensors instead of base stations -- making it easier for multiple users to share the same physical space. Mobile VR headsets, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard, use smartphones as the "brains" of their devices. These devices are cheaper and less powerful than their tethered counterparts, but users' movements aren't restricted by wires or their proximity to a PC or console. Google Cardboard (L) and Gear VR (R). Image source: Company websites. Standalone VR headsets aren't widely available yet, but they could strike a balance between the power of tethered headsets with the convenience of mobile ones. Oculus VR's upcoming Santa Cruz headset will free the Rift from PCs for a fully wireless experience. Augmented and mixed reality Augmented reality (AR) devices project digital overlays over real-world objects. Niantic's Pokemon Go, which projects Pokemon into real-life environments with the smartphone camera, is an early example of AR gaming. Digi-Capital believes that the AR market could be worth $90 billion by 2020, thanks to the growth of AR apps on mobile devices. In the near future, depth-sensing cameras will probably accurately place digital creatures onto real-world surfaces such as tables and floors -- paving the way for all new gameplay possibilities. Google Glass was also an early attempt to "augment" a user's reality with digital information, but it flopped because of privacy concerns. Looking ahead, the most closely watched AR device is Microsoft's HoloLens, which detects surfaces and projects holographic images on top of them. Microsoft has already showcased how the device can be used for tabletop Minecraft, the creation of 3D designs, or even projecting a hologram of another person into your room. The development version of the HoloLens still costs $3,000, but it should cost a lot less when it's finally released to the general public. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also trying to reduce the price of these next-gen AR devices down with Project Alloy, an open-source standalone headset that also projects virtual objects onto real-world ones. That device is powered by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing camera and a sixth-generation Core processor. Mixed reality (MR) is a newer term that's often used interchangeably with AR. Headsets such as the HoloLens and Project Alloy are often called MR devices because they "mix" VR features of head and motion tracking with AR features of digital overlays on real objects. Nonetheless, they can still simply be called AR devices because they "augment" users' reality without immersing them in a "virtual" world. Watch the ecosystems and the suppliers As these markets grow, battles between ecosystems will erupt. Facebook is already expanding its Oculus Home platform on the Rift and Gear VR, Google is introducing its rival Daydream platform, and Microsoft plans to turn Windows 10 into a holographic platform for its upcoming VR headsets and HoloLens. Suppliers will also engage in fierce battles to provide the components. InvenSense, STMicroelectronics, and Bosch are battling each other to supply the gyroscopes and accelerometers that track users' movements. AMD and NVIDIA are already making gaming GPU cards much cheaper with low-end "VR ready" cards. A $120 billion market opportunity If all goes well, the combined VR and AR market might be worth about $120 billion by 2020. However, mainstream adoption could be tough if VR and AR devices are merely considered pricey toys for hardcore gamers and tech enthusiasts. Therefore, prices will need to drop and killer apps (on par with Pokemon Go) must emerge to pique the public's interest. If that happens, the VR market could become a new pillar of growth for many of the companies mentioned here.

Back in the '90s Garry Kasparov faced off against IBM's Deep Blue in chess (complete with accusations of cheating aimed at the machine), and just a little over half a year ago Google's AlphaGo AI beat Lee Sedol at the ancient Chinese game of Go. Both systems were victorious. But now DeepMind, the Google subsidiary behind AlphaGo, has its sights on more modern stuff, specifically the real-time strategy video game and esports darling StarCraft II. At Blizzcon in California yesterday, the company announced that it's working with StarCraft maker Blizzard Entertainment to create an API for artificial intelligence that'll be available to researchers and hobbyists alike sometime next year. StarCraft II already has an AI system, of course, but the difference is that it doesn't behave like a human in the way Google's DeepMind is supposed to. It has access to information human players do not and can issue orders to units that would be outside a human's field of view. Even at its most benign, it's technically still cheating. That's intimidating, sure, but StarCraft II's smashing success proves it's hardly insurmountable. Humans have even been known to beat it when it's augmented with artificial intelligence systems apart from DeepMind's, as when a Russian player going by the name of Djem5 managed to beat three AI bots designed by the University of Alberta last December. DeepMind wants something better—an AI that uses the same information humans do while using the same field of view, but one that does simply does it better than us in the style of AlphaGo or Deep Blue. It's a bigger challenge than it may sound, as the whole game board is always visible to the AI in chess or Go, but in StarCraft II it has to work with our limitations. "Computers are capable of extremely fast control, but that doesn’t necessarily demonstrate intelligence, so agents must interact with the game within limits of human dexterity in terms of 'Actions Per Minute,'" said DeepMind researcher Oriol Vinyals in a blog post yesterday. Vinyals said the firm's particularly interested in StarCraft II for the way its fast-paced juggle of resources and troop movements "provide a useful bridge to the messiness of the real world." In time, given enough data from its own efforts and from other researchers using its API, the lessons learned "could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks." A Kasparov-style showdown isn't likely anytime soon. Vinyals cautions in the post that "we're still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player at StarCraft II," but then again, many commentators were sure AlphaGo wasn't quite ready to take on Sedol.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google’s Mobile-First Indexing Begins Now Mobile Search  News November 4, 2016 Leave a Comment Mobile Search News Matt SouthernNovember 4, 2016 SEJ STAFF 781SHARES 2.1KREADS 781SHARES 2.1KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 781SHARES 2.1KREADS Google is making the first step toward mobile-first indexing, a story we reported on last month, by testing a mobile-first search index. Going forward, Google’s index will primarily be crawling the mobile version of a site’s content to learn how it should be indexed in search. This is a considerable shift away from Google’s typical indexing practices, which involves crawling the desktop versions of web pages and indexing them in both mobile and desktop search results. Google illustrates the main issues with following the status quo: ”This can cause issues when the mobile page has less content than the desktop page because our algorithms are not evaluating the actual page that is seen by a mobile searcher.” While Google’s index will now be constructed of mobile documents, the company promises it will continue to deliver a great search experience no matter what device they’re using. What’s currently being referred to as an “experiment” is being carefully rolled out on a small scale over the next few months. After that time, Google will ramp up the experiment only when the company is satisfied it is providing the best search experience for everyone. Here are some quick tips from Google regarding this change: If you have a responsive site with identical content across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site where the primary content and markup is not identical across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version. Google recommends using the Structured Data Testing Tool to verify the equivalence of structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output. When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links. If you are a site owner who has only verified their desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version. If you only have a desktop site, Google will continue to index your desktop site just fine. If you are building a mobile version of your site, do not launch it until it’s ready. Google says: “a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site.” Related Posts Search Live Coverage Carousel Comes to Google With Real-Time Indexing Google is Splitting its Search Index, Prioritizing Mobile over Desktop Google to Prioritize the Indexing of HTTPS Pages Matt Cutts Explains How To Let Google Know When There’s A Mobile Version Of A Page Bio Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

Australia 12-4 New Zealand Live feed Show 6.07pm EDT 18:07 Summary If you’re a NSW supporter you’ve just witnessed what Cameron Smith and friends seemingly did game-in, game-out for the best part of the last decade during Origin: win crucial games between almost equally-matched opponents. Australia were incredibly disciplined, they did all the little stuff right, but if you’re David Kidwell you’d be tearing you hair out after that. The ‘what-ifs’ will be reverberating around his skull in the hotel room tonight; his side showed the full gamut - the unfathomable skill and brilliance of Johnson, with the Jekyll and Hyde of kicks out on the full, kicks too deep across the ingoal, and conversion attempts inexplicably missed. At key moments players like Inglis and Thurston came up with the important tackles - don’t forget Isaac Luke was just inches from putting NZ in 10-6 down at half-time, but for Thurston’s tryline heroics. Moments like Taupau’s indiscipline in the tackle have let NZ down here - they were far better in patches than Australia, but also far worse - and it’s a victory for a more consistent Kangaroos performance, but far from emphatic. England would have watched this with interest, knowing they need to now beat Australia to make the Four Nations final. There will have been enough there to have interested Wayne Bennett - what a cracking final group game that will be. A great eighty minutes of league, and Kangaroos fans will be relieved. The old pros, too experienced and too good at all the one per-centers.

Well, you can’t fault the Kiwis for effort or heart - they gave absolutely everything and nearly conjured the miraculous. The Kangaroos run to hug and celebrate; they know they’ve got away with one. A great, tight battle - and if these are our finalists, then we’re set for a real treat. Super rugby league.

Absolutely lovely chip and chase - the bounce was awful but the mercurial halfback just scoops it in, brilliantly. Throws a no-look pass to Kenny-Dowall who feeds Rapana. Great play, NZ. Johnson with the chance at the extras from the conversion - but having done the hard stuff, the halfback’s missed with the easy bit!

Kiwis with a scrum and half an opportunity - but oh deary me. They’ve attempted a kick straight away, and that’s not even close. Expect ‘game management’ from Smith to come into full effect here, as Australia just eat up metres, and time.

Australia with an opportunity from about 20m out after a strong hit-up from Scott. Kangaroos go to the skies, but it’s well defused. NZ restart and spread left. Great offload and Luke makes great metres through the centre - a series of good rolling footy - real razzle-dazzle stuff from the Kiwis - but they’re pinged for a forward pass! Noo, the commentators are convinced, but I’m not. Especially off the back of such a lovely passage of league - it’s a lose ball, falling over the shoulder as a player is tackled; surely you can give benefit of the doubt to the attackers? Not so.

Will this cost his side? Another massive run from Klemmer, and all of a sudden this has set up nicely for Australia. The Kiwis hold on, but literally, and are penalised - Tohu Harris the man pinned, and Cameron Smith points to the sticks. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.20pm EDT 17:20 50 min: Well. Cameron Smith gives his men a proper bollocking in backplay while that kick was being taken. Didn’t do a lot wrong there, the Kangaroos, but they find themselves in a contest again. Updated at 5.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.19pm EDT 17:19 Try! Australia 10-4 New Zealand (Kata) 48 min: Ferguson gets caught at marker and Kiwis look to exploit their numerical advantage out wide. Solomone Kata makes a charge for the line but he’s met by three in green & gold; they try to hold him, but he’s too strong. Great work from the Warriors centre - and we’re back on! Johnson with a difficult one from wide, but it drifts astray. No extras - a converted try the difference. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.16pm EDT 17:16 48 min: Smith penalised for holding on too long, and now the Kiwis get a good look here. On the second about 25m out. What can they conjure. Johnson kicks early, it’s played at by Australia - six again - and only 15m out! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.14pm EDT 17:14 46 min: O’Neill runs into an absolute wall of black - three in the tackle there. Strong metres from Cordner again, he’s been impressive - and almost puts Morgan into a whole. Meanwhile the Kangaroos spin to test the Kiwi’s left edge defence but it’s a poor pass from Gillett and we have a turnover. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.12pm EDT 17:12 44 min: Johnson runs on the last, brilliant defence from JT who not only chases the kicker, but then somehow also retrieves the chipped kick and passes off to Boyd who’s tackled on his own 30m. Updated at 5.12pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.10pm EDT 17:10 42 min: Slow going coming out from the Kiwis, after 5 tackles they’re still stuck in their own 40m. Kick away is decent, but Australia take the first tackle only just inside their own half. The early pressure is coming from Australia therefore, although nobody reads JT’s inside grubber, and the Kiwis deal comfortably. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.08pm EDT 17:08 Second half: Australia 10-0 New Zealand 40 min: Kangaroos to restart and straight away it’s a strong carry from Klemmer. He’s an axe, this kid. Cordner also with good metres before Thurston gets a steady kick away. NZ restart from about 5m out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.05pm EDT 17:05 Incidentally, if you missed the earlier England v Scotland game, here’s Aaron Bower’s lovely write up: Elliott Whitehead revives England in Four Nations after Scotland scare Read more I only caught the late exchanges, but sounds like Scotland gave this a real good crack early on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.02pm EDT 17:02 Looking at some of these half-time highlights, the Kiwis sure had some great half-chances. All the talk is about Shaun Johnson - but it’s a lot of pressure on one man’s shoulders. Who else can be the X-factor if NZ are to try and snatch this? Updated at 5.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.56pm EDT 16:56 So! Catch your breath if you can - what did you make of that? Perhaps the Coventry chill was getting to some of these warm-blooded mammals early on, because there was some uncharacteristically sloppy basic errors to start. New Zealand especially looked ropey in defence, dropping tackles and allowing Australia to make some easy busts. When they conceded the second try you thought it could turn into a procession; but thereafter the Kiwis galvanised, and but for a few millimetres and some strong work from JT could have gone in 10-6. This one’s definitely not dead therefore, let’s see how the second stanza unfolds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.51pm EDT 16:51 Half-time: Australia 10-0 New Zealand 40 min: Yes, they can. Great defence. The Kiwis get a strong kick away and the siren/hooter sounds/bellows. An action-packed first forty! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.49pm EDT 16:49 39 min: After the drama of that little passage, suddenly we’re up the other end again - some tired bodies falling away from tackles, and Klemmer crosses.. but he’s held up! 20m restart - can the Kiwis hold on, right in the shadow of half-time? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.48pm EDT 16:48 37 min: Kiwis giving this a red hot go just before halftime. Some great carries through the centre, before Isaac Luke goes agonisingly close to crossing! Johnson jinks left, jinks right - he puts his hooker into a half-hole but JT does just enough, and possibly also the padding from the post stops Luke’s momentum. What an unlucky break for NZ, and the Roos hold on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.45pm EDT 16:45 35 min: Klemmer with a strong run - almost didn’t recognise him with actual hair. This is a borderline afro, for those more accustomed to his NSW Blues shaved noggin look. JT grubbers through but Rapana does excellently to get back into the field of play. A good little period this - the Kiwis have come back into the contest, they’re fighting well. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.42pm EDT 16:42 33 min: No says the video ref! O’Neill just millimetres short of the line. Great scrambling defence and desperation from the Kiwis - if they conceded a third it almost certainly would have been a real body blow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.41pm EDT 16:41 32 min: Good metres again from Cordner, here’s running hard and straight with his distinctive upright carriage. Brilliant quick-thinking from Thurston, he kicks through for O’Neill - he slides for the line; is he over? This would be heartbreaking for Kiwi fans! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.38pm EDT 16:38 30 min: Big break by O’Neill, and the Roos are looking lively again. Kiwis doing much better defensively, and it’s a misunderstanding from Australia and they bomb the pass. Kiwis with a chance to put together a better six. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.37pm EDT 16:37 28 min: Taumalolo with a solid run up the guts, Kata comes inside for a run. Bromwich offloads for Johnson, but again he’s put that one far too deep. These ingoals are tiny! You wonder if the players had a good look at that pre-game, because that’s a set of six just thrown away. New Zealand’s Jason Taumalolo is stopped by the Australian defence. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Updated at 5.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.35pm EDT 16:35 26 min: Kata pinned for a dangerous tackle - no malice, just one of those that gets out of control. Another opportunity for the Roos, as if they need an invitation. Boyd rushes for the corner, but NZ hold on - better defence from the men in black & white. Smith with the final play kick, but that one wasn’t flash, and the Kiwis survive. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.33pm EDT 16:33 24 min: Smith almost puts Merrin in, before the Kiwis rush out to stop Morgan. Great inside grubber for JT, but it’s carried into touch and it’s six again. Great pressure here, Kiwis have to hold on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.31pm EDT 16:31 22 min: Thurston with an excellent kick to the corner, he turns around Beale and earns a repeat six with Ferguson wrapping up his opposite number ingoal. Six again, Kangaroos. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.30pm EDT 16:30 19 min: And as so often happens, after failing to cross the Kiwis now find themselves right on the back foot. Aaron Woods charges for the line and almost loses his shorts in the process. You’ll be happy you missed that little cameo, dear readers. This is going end-to-end! As the Roos push it wide, looking to find Holmes with a cutout it’s Rapana who plucks the intercept and runs 40m. Inglis with a desperate attempt at an ankle tap and just slows the winger. But with a great opportunity beckoning the Kiwis duff the pass. Horrible ball to Johnson, who puts it down and the moment’s lost. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.27pm EDT 16:27 16 min: Smith kicks early to keep the Kiwis on their own line. But it’s a relieving penalty against Trent Merrin and NZ restart from about 30m out. Some of the line markings are a bit confusing, the residual lines from a football (soccer) game remain - it’s the Kiwis charging up to the six-yard box. Huge hit! Inglis charges out of the line and lines up the fullback Kahu - looked a good tackle, but we pause for replays to see if it was high. Nope, the refs are happy. Kiwis spin to the left, real chance here, they need to strike back - but the last play kick runs deep! Very short in-goals here, kickers will have to note that, it really affects your final play options. Updated at 4.27pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.22pm EDT 16:22 Try! Australia 10-0 New Zealand (Thurston) 14 min: Deary me, the Kiwis defence is at sixes and sevens - great bust by Cordner to start it, then it’s a lovely show-and-go from Morgan, draws far too much interest from two, three players to put Ferguson into a hole. He charges at the line and offloads, and who’s there to back up? Well, you knew without asking, didn’t you, JT. This time he’s successful with the kick from a slightly kinder angle - Australia with all the early running. Johnathan Thurston, centre, celebrates scoring the second try for Australia. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters Updated at 4.59pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.19pm EDT 16:19 13 min: Holmes now puts down a swirling bomb - gee, there are some errors out there so far! Boyd does well to recover, and the danger is averted. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.18pm EDT 16:18 11 min: Incidentally, if you missed the earlier clash, England ran out comfortable winners over Scotland 38-12. I was reminded of that because of the poor Scottish kicker - missed three from three. Meanwhile, back on the field a great dart, this time on the opposite flank and it’s Holmes busting away. They’re opening them up on the flanks are the Roos. Once again though, it’s Australia who force a pass and they neutralise their own advantage with a dropped ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EDT 16:16 Try! Australia 4-0 New Zealand (Ferguson) 9 min: Great angled dart from Morgan, he’s pulled down about 5m out. But the Kiwis are again penalised! Too long holding on, Johnson prevents the five-eighth from playing, and Australia are given another six from 10m out. They spread wide, NZ are short of numbers and Ferguson does well to stand up one or two and crosses comfortably in the corner. JT lines up the conversion from right on the touchline. No dice - just to the right of the uprights. Blake Ferguson scores the first try for Australia. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters Updated at 4.58pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.13pm EDT 16:13 8 min: First penalty of the game, Proctor pinged for hanging on too long in the tackle. Smith kicks for touch, and they start this set about 30m out. What can they muster? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EDT 16:12 6 min: Kiwis spread it wide for the first time, Kenny Dowall with it in the hands, before a lovely little cameo from Johnson. Straight away though it’s Ferguson with the first bust of the game - great run from the winger, he picks up 60m before being hauled down. Next play, would you believe it, big GI puts it down cold. Turn over and what a let off! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.10pm EDT 16:10 5 min: Strong defensive work again from the Kiwis, quite a few players wearing skins under their jerseys - quite a different look for those that follow the NRL, it could be a tough nippy in Coventry for this night-time kick off. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.08pm EDT 16:08 3 min: Kiwis with the marginally sharper start, they’re enjoying slightly better field position, but it’s a disappointing kick to close and some pressure is relieved as Kangaroos bring out from about 15m out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.06pm EDT 16:06 Kick-off: Australia 0-0 New Zealand 1 min: And we’re away, Kiwis receive. Steady bash and carry before Johnson puts a well-weighted kick to the corner. Australia make their way out from their line, no great metres here - good defence. Updated at 4.06pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EDT 16:03 Anthems well observed. Quite bizarrely there was a very karaoke-esque backing track on the New Zealand anthem. Even some dirty bass grinding in. Very odd. Flags, choirs and children ushered away - the Kiwis are circling up for the Haka which means we are in for business. No matter how many times you watch one of these they still remain spine-tingling. Well led from Isaac Luke, in contrast a close up of an almost impassive Cameron Smith. Alright. I reckon we’re ready - let’s go! Updated at 4.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EDT 15:57 Kick off not a million miles away here, the players are running through their last shoulder-smacking drills in the sheds. A nice close up of the trophy, resplendent with pretty ribbons like a fair horse. The Australian team makes it’s way out into the tunnel, and Jesse Bromwich and Cameron Smith lead their chargers out for the anthems.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.47pm EDT 15:47 Preamble Like Sparta and Athens, Australia v New Zealand is a rivalry for the ages. Sure, both nations are only a few hundred years old, and part of their respective national identities were forged together on the beaches of Turkey. They may have also competed together under a shared flag at the Olympics but I promise you - when it comes to rugby league this remains a proper ding dong. Australia may have come comfortably past Scotland in their opening match, whereas New Zealand only just squeaked past Wayne Bennett’s England by one point. That all matters for nearly nothing as both sides know a win here will virtually book a spot in the Four Nations final. Earlier in the year the Kangaroos were almost comfortable in knocking over the Kiwis twice, but you’d need a short memory to forget the dramatic group stage win by the New Zealanders at the 2014 Four Nations, matched only by the tectonic clash that then followed in the final. It’s a contest that’s gotten tighter and tighter with every passing year, and this latest installment should be no exception - grab your pork scratchings and moisten your lips.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google aims to help developers, make more apps interesting with Playtime By R Padla - November 5, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is making Play more fun and exciting. If you’re familiair with Playtime (no, not that Playtime Pad), a series of developer events, you’d be happy to know that Google is getting busy once again. The company has helped a lot of developers already. More businesses have expanded and the tech giant continues by launching events in different countries. In the United States, Google is set to launch new programs and tools that hopefully will make our mobile and digital lives better. Google Play is extending from smartphones and tablets to more devices like the Chromebook and a VR headset. The Daydream is a new platform that makes virtual reality more accessible to the masses. VR apps will be available soon on the Google Play Store. On the Chromebook, the Play Store is supported but still on beta on some devices. Most Android apps should run but there may be limits. On the wearable arena, Android Wear 2.0 is now on developer preview phase and should be ready soon. Google aims to bring the right tools and features for all app developers with the Play Developer Console. Hopefully, this will help developers cash in on and increase user engagement of their apps. Another helpful way to increase revenue is offering a service with subscription. More and more developers are using this business model and now you can offer as low as $1 per month, at least for the first few months. Free trials can be offered but offering a premium will help these developers get more relevant, target, and quality subscriber base. Pre-registration can also be useful as it helps build anticipation for a new game or title. Early Access canbe offered and this way, developers can know what to improve from the beta build. Google also announced that there’s a new API that can help developers to identify users requested for refunds. The feature is still in beta mode but should be available for all developers soon.

 I just spent a day in a mindfulness program developed at Google and left with 5 key lessons Shana Lebowitz Nov. 5, 2016, 3:20 PM 20,115 facebook linkedin twitter email print Search Inside Yourself teaches participants to reckon with difficult emotions. Caleb Roenigk/Flickr About five minutes before Search Inside Yourself was scheduled to start, I was running through New York City's Flatiron District, using half my mouth to chew a blueberry muffin and the other half to curse the fates for letting me oversleep by an hour. It was a fitting start to a day of mindfulness training. Search Insider Yourself (SIY) is a two-day program that teaches participants skills around mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and resilience. It was originally developed at Google, by the company's 107th employee, Chade-Meng Tan (a.k.a. the "Jolly Good Fellow"). Today, Tan no longer works at Google, where the program continues. But he sits on the board of the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, which offers public SIY programs across the globe. (If you can't make it to a public SIY program, you can also download the free app Whil, which offers a digital version.) SIYLI invited me to participate in (and comped my admission to) the $1,250 New York City program in November. I attended the first day of the program, where about 100 people, some from as far away as Ethiopia, learned mindfulness practices and the benefits behind them. For me, the class was a much-needed opportunity to stop running, chewing, and cursing, and really notice what was happening — both around and inside me. Below, I've rounded up the insights from SIY that most resonated with me. 1. It's impossible to 'fail' at meditation One of the two SIY teachers who led the program, Laurie Cameron, debunked the myth that if you keep getting distracted while sitting, meditation isn't for you. Instead, she recommended thinking of meditation as training your mental muscles and each distraction that arises as an opportunity to do a "mental rep." Here's how it works: You start out by following your breath. A distraction arises. You notice the distraction. You reorient your attention to the breath. One rep down. While those distractions can be frustrating, it's important to treat yourself with kindness and to reorient your attention as gently as possible. 2. Talking about emotions differently can help you deal with them in a more productive way Robert Chender, the other SIY teacher, said there are two ways to handle emotions. One is the existential way: "I am angry." The other is the physiological way: "I experience anger in my body." That second framing might sound weird — but if you think about emotions that way, at least in your own head, it's somewhat freeing. Your emotions are no longer all-consuming entities that guide your choices; they're transient states. Think of emotions, Cameron added, as "passing through me like a cloud." It's the difference between being inside an emotion or stepping outside of it, Cameron said when we spoke by phone later that week. You don't let your emotions define you. At the SIY session in New York City. Shana Lebowitz/Business Insider 3. You can get better at acknowledging your emotions before they spiral out of control "Emotions are actually feelings in the body," Chender explained. The key is recognizing when you're experiencing a particular bodily sensation. One way to do that is a body scan. Starting at the top of your head, check in with every part of your body and notice what it feels like. That way, you can catch any simmering negative feelings before you act on them. For example, maybe your cheeks are hot, or your fists are clenched. You might be experiencing anger. Cameron told me that the more you practice tuning into your bodily sensations, the better you'll get at identifying them. At first, it might take you an hour to realize that you were experiencing anger. At some point, though, you'll be able to realize what's going on while you're experiencing that anger. Then you can label the emotion as such, which can help decrease its intensity. Finally, you can tap into your thinking brain to figure out what to do next, instead of acting out of extreme anger, or sadness, or whatever it is you're experiencing. 4. When you're feeling a difficult emotion, the best thing to do is pause Cameron and Chender taught the SBNRR technique for dealing with emotions in tense situations: Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond. Here's how it would play out if you were in a meeting and someone announced that you did something wrong: Stop: Don't say anything just yet. Breathe: Take a deep breath. Notice: Observe the feelings you're experiencing, for example anger or defensiveness. Observe any physical sensations, for example weakness or nausea. Reflect: Figure out what the underlying feeling is: Maybe you're doubting yourself, or maybe you feel vulnerable. Respond: Choose to act in a way that makes logical sense. Again, it takes practice to get good at this technique. Eventually, it won't take several minutes to SBNRR; it'll be your automatic pattern as soon as something triggers you. You can also practice SBNRR on your own by mentally replaying a stressful situation and thinking about how you could have handled it differently. 5. Treat others — and yourself — with kindness Chender led a practice called "open awareness," which trains you to focus deeply on the present. You notice and welcome whatever comes your way — sounds, smells, and feelings, for example. At one point during the practice, Robert instructed SIY participants to treat all these stimuli with kindness and openness "because you are a very good and kind person." That idea of showing yourself compassion, of recognizing the person you're trying to be, struck me as both important and undervalued. Cameron told me that meditation isn't just about training your attention — it's also about training the way you speak to yourself. We all have an inner voice that can sometimes be critical, Cameron said. "With mindfulness, we learn to develop awareness of that voice in the head and we can learn to talk to ourselves with kindness instead of scolding or self-judgment."

Sander Venema Menu Skip to content Home Talks TV About Why I won’t recommend Signal anymore One of the things I do is cryptography and infosec training for investigative journalists who have a need to keep either their sources and communications confidential so they can more safely do their work in the public interest. Often they work in places which are heavily surveilled, like Europe, or the United States. Ed Snowden’s documents explain a thing or two about how the US intelligence apparatus goes about its day-to-day business. They sometimes also work in places in the world where rubber hose cryptanalysis is more common than in say the U.S. or Europe. Which is why crypto tools alone are not the Alpha and the Omega of (personal) security. This requires careful consideration of what to use when, and in what situation. One of the things I have recommended in the past for various cases is the OpenWhisperSystems’ app called Signal, available for Android and iOS. In this article, I want to explain my reasons why I won’t be recommending Signal in the future. To be clear: the reason for this is not security. To the best of my knowledge, the Signal protocol is cryptographically sound, and your communications should still be secure. The reason has much more to do with the way the project is run, the focus and certain dependencies of the official (Android) Signal app, as well as the future of the Internet, and what future we would like to build and live in. This post was mostly sparked by Signal’s Giphy experiment, which shows a direction for the project that I wouldn’t have taken. There are other, bigger issues which deserve our attention. What is Signal? Signal is an app published by OpenWhisperSystems, a company run by Moxie Marlinspike. It has published an official Signal app for Google Android, and Apple iOS. Signal has been instrumental in providing an easy-to-use, cryptographically secure texting and calling app. It is a combination of the previously separate apps TextSecure and Redphone, which were combined into one app called Signal. One of the main reasons why I recommended it previously to people was that it was easy to use, next to the cryptographic security. This is one good thing Signal has going for it. People could just install it and then communicate securely. Cryptographic software needs to be much more simple to use, and use securely, and Signal is doing its thing on the mobile platforms to create an easy-to-use secure messaging platform. I do appreciate them for that. I wanted to get that out of the way. Multiple problems with Signal There are however, multiple issues with Signal, namely: Lack of federation Dependency on Google Cloud Messaging Your contact list is not private The RedPhone server is not open-source I’ll go into these one at a time. Lack of federation There is a modified version of Signal called LibreSignal, that removed the Google dependency from the Signal app, allowing Signal to be run on other (Android) devices, like CopperheadOS, or Jolla phones (with Android compatibility layer). In May this year, however, Moxie made it clear that he does not want LibreSignal to use the Signal servers, and that he does not approve of the name. The name is something that can change, that is not a problem. What is a problem, however, is the fact that he does not want LibreSignal to use the Signal servers. Which would be fine if he allowed LibreSignal to federate across using their own servers. This was tried once (Cyanogenmod, and also offered to Telegram, of all people) but subsequently abandoned, because Moxie believes it slows down changes to the app and/or protocol. The whole problem with his position however, is that I don’t see the point of doing any of this secure messaging stuff, without having federation. The internet was built on federation. Multiple e-mail providers and servers for instance, can communicate effortlessly with one another, so I can send an e-mail to someone who has a Gmail address or a corporate address, etc. without effort and it all works. This works because of federation, because the protocols are all open standards and there are multiple implementations of the standards who can cooperate and communicate together. Another example would be the Jabber/XMPP protocol, which also has multiple clients on multiple platforms who can communicate securely with one another, despite one having a Jabber account on another server than the other. If we don’t federate, if we don’t cooperate, what is there to stop the internet from becoming a bunch of proprietary walled gardens again? Is the internet then really nothing more than just a platform for us to use certain proprietary silo services on? Signal then, just happens to be a (partly proprietary) silo on which your messages are transmitted securely. Dependency on Google Cloud Messaging Currently, the official Signal client depends on Google Cloud Messaging to work correctly. The alternative that has been developed by the people of LibreSignal has removed that dependency, so people running other software, like Jolla or CopperheadOS can run Signal. Unfortunately, the policy decisions of OpenWhisperSystems and Moxie Marlinspike make it so that it became impossible to reliably run unofficial Signal clients that use the same server infrastructure, so people can communicate. Also, federation, like explained in the previous section, is expressly hindered and prohibited by OpenWhisperSystems, so it is not an option for LibreSignal to simply run their own servers and then federate within the wider Signal network, allowing people to contact each other across clients. What is Google Cloud Messaging? The Google Cloud Messaging service is used by Signal with empty messages in order to wake up the device before the actual messages are pushed to the device by Signal’s servers.[1] There is a way to use Signal without depending on GCM, but that uses microg, and that asks people to basically re-compile their kernel (at least I had to in my case). This is not something you can ask of non-technical users. I would like to be able to run an official Signal client (or any secure messaging client) on hardware that runs CopperheadOS for example. Unrelated to GCM directly, but since on Android devices, Google usually has root access to the phone, there’s the issue of integrity. Google is still cooperating with the NSA and other intelligence agencies. PRISM is also still a thing. I’m pretty sure that Google could serve a specially modified update or version of Signal to specific targets for surveillance, and they would be none the wiser that they installed malware on their phones. For this reason it would also be strongly preferable to run a secure messaging client on a more secure platform. Currently when it comes to Signal this cannot be done in any official way, and it would help for the people who really need secure messaging services (instead of the people who merely use it as a replacement of say WhatsApp), if the software runs on other Android distributions, like Copperhead.[2] Your contact list (social graph) is not private Here is the permission list of Signal, including OpenWhisperSystems’ explanation for the need for them. As you can clearly see, Signal is allowed (if you install it), to read and modify your contacts. Signal associates phone numbers with names in a similar way that Whatsapp is doing, and this is a big reason why they feel they need to read your contact list. Also, there’s a usability thing where they display the contacts’ names and pictures in the Signal app. It hashes them before sending them to the server, but since the space of possible hashes is so small for phone numbers, this does not provide a lot of security. Moxie has stated previously (in 2014) that the problem of private contact discovery is difficult, lays out different strategies that don’t work or do not give satisfying performance, and then admits it’s still an unsolved problem. Discussion regarding this seemed to have moved from a Github issue to a mailing list, and I don’t know of any improvement on this front.[2] This could of course all been done differently, by using usernames to connect users instead of their phone numbers (incidentally, this would also allow people who use multiple phone numbers on the same device to use Signal reliably). And last time I checked, if you use the same phone number on a different device, Signal will get deregistered on the old device. Another issue, and a plus for using usernames, is that you may want to use Signal with people you don’t necessarily want to give your phone number to. And federation would also be easier with usernames, and servers, separated by a symbol, like the @. Just like in the case of Jabber/XMPP. I also see no usability issues here, as even very non-technical people generally get the concept of an address, or an e-mail address, and this would be very similar. RedPhone not open source The phone component of Signal is called RedPhone. The server component of this is unfortunately not open source (so people are prevented from running their own phone servers, and this is also probably the reason why secure encrypted phone calls don’t work in e.g. LibreSignal.) I don’t know exactly what prevents the RedPhone server code from being released (whether it is legal issues or simple unwillingness), but I do think it is strange that there is no movement whatsoever to move to a different/alternative solution, that respects users’ rights. Moving forward The big question now, as also said by @shiromarieke on Twitter, is what post-Signal tool we want to use. I don’t know the answer to that question yet, but I will lay out my minimum requirements of such a piece of software here. We as a community need to come up with a viable solution and alternative to Signal that is easy to use and that does in fact respect people’s choices, both in the hardware and software that they choose to run. In my view, there should be a tool that is fully free software (as defined by the GNU GPL), that respects users’ freedoms to freely inspect, use, modify the software and distribute modified copies of the software. Also, this tool should not have dependencies on corporate infrastructure like Google’s (basically any partner in PRISM), that allows these parties to control the correct working of the software. The fact that Signal depends on Google Cloud Messaging, and Google technology in general is something that should be avoided. In the end, I think we need to move to an Internet where there are more federated services, not less, where information is openly shared, and services publicly run by multiple people all over the world. Otherwise, we’ll be in danger of ending up in an neo-90s Internet, with walled gardens and pay walls all over the place. You already see this trend happening in journalism. We need to remember that we’re fighting not only against government surveillance, but also against corporate surveillance as well. We need ways to defend against this, and using corporate solutions that create a dependency on these solutions, even if the communications themselves are not readable to them, there’s still the issue of metadata, and of course general availability of Google’s services to Signal. It’s really unfortunate that OpenWhisperSystems isn’t more friendly to initiatives like LibreSignal, since these people did a lot of work which is now basically going to be thrown away because the person running Signal is not friendly to these initiatives. We need to cooperate more as a community instead of creating these little islands, otherwise we are not going to succeed in defeating or even meaningfully defending against Big Brother. Remember, our enemy knows how to divide and conquer. Divide et impere. It’s been a basic government subjugation tactic since the Roman times. We should not allow our own petty egos and quest for eternal hacker fame to get in the way of our actual goal: dismantling the surveillance states globally. Notes: [1]: An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that GCM was used to transport Signal messages. While correct for a previous version of TextSecure, this is in fact not correct anymore for Signal. I’ve updated it, in response to this HN comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12882815. [2]: Clarified my position re Google and GCM and the contact list / private contact discovery issue a bit.

While Newt isn't afforded such luxuries, it doesn't mean ou can't use them to explore a bit more of his world. Google has joined up with Fantastic Beasts on a multitude of platforms, including Google Maps. Clicking here will pull up distinct locations from the universe and explore them in street view. The first is the Magical Congress of the USA, located at the Steen National Bank, but if you want something a bit less formal, you can head over to The Blind Pig, the underground bar of choice for wizards. You can also explore the apartment of Tina and Queenie Goldstein to get a better sense of who those characters are. You don't have to just limit your wizarding to maps either, as if you simply speak "Okay Google" into your android phone, you'll have several options. Saying "Silencio" will mute your phone, while "Lumos" will activate the phone's flashlight. To turn it off, simply say "Nox". If you've already preordered the Google Daydream, you'll have a Fantastic Beasts experience right out of the box. Here you'll be able to explore Newt's magical case with a wand in hand for a surreal and magical experience. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an all-new adventure returning us to the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling. Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) stars in the central role of wizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander, under the direction of David Yates, who helmed the last four Harry Potter blockbusters. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident...were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt’s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.

Will AI soon beat humans in the strategy game?  ( Blizzard ) Advertisement AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence program powered by Google's DeepMind, defeated South Korean world Go champion Lee Sedol convincingly with a 4-1 score earlier in the year. It seems that DeepMind is now moving on to a bigger challenge, going from an ancient board game into a modern strategy video game. StarCraft II As An AI At the ongoing BlizzCon 2016, Blizzard and Google announced a collaboration to open up StarCraft II as an AI and machine learning environment for researchers around the world. StarCraft II is one of the most fiercely competitive video games that is played professionally, and according to the DeepMind team, it will provide an interesting testing environment for research in AI as it "provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world." "The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks," said Oriol Vinyals, a research scientist for DeepMind who was once the top-ranked player of the game in Spain. While the complexity of Go is the result of a combination of simple rules, there exists several layers of such complexity in StarCraft II. The game requires players to make a succession of strategic decisions while they farm resources, build structures, create units and engage their opponents in combat. Also, unlike Go where all the information is available to players as they progress in the game, the map of StarCraft II is initially obscured, giving them less information to base their decisions on. As such, playing the strategy game requires both memory and adaptation, along with long-term planning. What To Expect From DeepMind And Blizzard Collaboration According to the DeepMind team, the environment that it will be working on with Blizzard for AI research will be made available to all researchers in the field by next year. The environment will simplify the visuals of StarCraft II to be better received by machine learning systems, with an API that will allow for similar functions to bots in the past which study game data. Blizzard will also be providing replays of StarCraft II matches to give the AI systems data to analyze. Will DeepMind be able to create an AI that can dominate matches against humans in StarCraft II, similar to how AlphaGo performed exceeding well against a world champion? That is the ultimate goal of the project, but the DeepMind team said that such an achievement is still very much in the future. However, it should be noted that AlphaGo's ability to win against a human opponent was developed earlier than expected.

Eden Hazard’s two goals, both scored after trademark solo bursts forward, make him man of the match by a whisker, but Pedro and Diego Costa were equally lethal going forward, while Victor Moses, N’Golo Kanté, Marcos Alonso and Nemanja Matic all deserve a name check for their relentless midfield efforts. As good as Chelsea were, Everton simply didn’t turn up. The game was up after 20 minutes, and Ronald Koeman’s tactical tweaks had no impact, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku cut out of the game completely. They face Swansea after the international break before tests against Southampton and Manchester United. Chelsea face Middlesbrough (A), Tottenham (H) and Man City (A) next. We’ll have a better idea of their title credentials in a month, but they’re top of the table, with five wins and five clean sheets in a row. They’re 3-1 for the title; would you bet against them?

Apart from getting the highest score for a smartphone on DxOMark, the camera rating website, tech reviewers (including us) have been pouring in rave reviews for the Pixel’s camera. We wanted to take a closer look, and what better time to do a shootout than my vacation in France? I had a Pixel in one pocket and an iPhone 7 Plus in the other. I wanted to approach the shootout as a layperson, without any phone tripods or manual camera apps — only stock software, what an average consumer would use. Related: Google Pixel review I ended up using the Pixel as my main camera throughout my nine days in France, which is a first for me as I usually stick with my DSLR. It was one of the first times that I had a trouble-free experience with an Android smartphone camera, and I was able to quickly grab shots thanks to Google’s ingenious shortcut to launch the camera app — double-tapping the power button. You can then use the volume buttons as the shutter button. The cameras on most Android smartphones have been unreliable in my experience. We’re not denying that cameras from phones like the Nexus 6P and 5X, for example, haven’t offered stellar shots. But there has always been something that made the experience frustrating, whether it’s a delay when launching the camera, long-processing times, or shutter lag. Google’s Pixel fixes all of these problems and more. Panorama by the Pixel. There’s almost zero lag using the Pixel camera. I initially said in my review that the camera took half-a-second to capture photos with HDR+, which was annoying at times, but a software update has made it instantaneous. It still takes about two to three seconds to process these HDR+ photos. HDR+ captures several shots with the short exposure times. The best shot is then used as a base, and the others are then layered over to offer a photograph with less noise and blur — perfect for low-light scenarios. It also helps with high-dynamic range environments by taking multiple photos with the same exposure, so that bright parts of a photo aren’t blown out. Related: We put the new Google Pixel XL smartphone through its paces – so how did it do? Both the Pixel and Pixel XL have the same camera on the rear, with 12.3 megapixels and a large pixel size (1.55 micron pixels) which helps for low-light photography. Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus also has a rear camera with 12.3 megapixels, but it also has a second lens that lets you optically zoom for a closer shot. The second telephoto lens is also used for Portrait mode, which adds a DSLR-like blur around a subject. A close match So what have I learned in my time using the two flagship phones? The iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel have excellent cameras, and declaring a winner isn’t cut and dry. There are times the Pixel offers superior photos, but there are plenty of moments where the iPhone comes out on top. Photos from the Pixel often have bluer hues, whereas iPhone images are warmer. The latter also has more realistic photos, but that doesn’t mean the shots are better. A lot of times I prefer the more saturated images on the Pixel, especially in daylight conditions, but your personal preference may vary. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here’s a good example showcasing the bluer hues on the Pixel and the warmer colors on the iPhone. Overall, I prefer the Pixel photo for two reasons — there’s more detail when you zoom in, but more importantly the colors pop out and there’s a little more contrast. That makes the picture look more interesting, and I find the iPhone photo to be a little bland and flat, even if it is brighter. Below is a closer look at the same photo. You can see a lot more detail as you look further into the distance, but even in the foreground, the trees on the iPhone 7 Plus look like an oil painting, whereas it’s easier to make out more structures on the Pixel. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here are a few more comparisons between the Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus. You can click on images to enlarge them. iPhone 7 Plus photos were transferred manually from the device to a PC, and the Pixel photos were downloaded from Google Photos — they are the full resolution images, thanks to the free storage option from Google for Pixel owners. The photos are likely compressed when uploaded to WordPress, though. All the photos were taken in Auto-HDR mode — it’s the default setting for both cameras. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Overall, the Pixel photos are a little sharper and are often more saturated. The iPhone’s photos tend to be a little more realistic, but they sometimes look flat and less dynamic. In low-light scenarios, you do need to make sure you hold your Pixel steady, as it doesn’t have optical-image stabilization. The iPhone has the leg up here, as we sometimes had to take an extra photo with the Pixel to make sure it wasn’t blurry. You may end up liking the iPhone 7 Plus photos over the Pixel, which is valid, because the answer to which photo is better is purely subjective. Both phones take excellent photos and they won’t disappoint in real-world performance with shutter lag or any other issues. Oversaturation The over-saturation on the Pixel can be problematic at times. Take a look at the images below: Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here’s one scenario where the Pixel went overboard. The iPhone photo retains more detail and is pleasing to the eye — like a still from a movie. The Pixel’s photo has too many colors blown up, which is distracting. There were a handful of moments, particularly in low-light environments, where I would have preferred the Pixel to crank the saturation down. Hopefully, Google can fix the phone’s tendency to oversaturate in low-light via a software update. Lens Blur Unfortunately, I don’t have many photos taken with the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode to compare it with Google’s Lens Blur. Still, from my experience using both over the past few weeks, I believe Apple’s implementation is consistently accurate and tends to look better than Google’s. Related: Does the Google Pixel really have the best smartphone camera? Judge for yourself Lens Blur still is a great way to place emphasis on a subject, like portraits. Once you select the mode, after you capture a photo the app will prompt you to raise your camera up. The photo will then take a few seconds to process, but you’ll then end up with something like this: Pixel The effect on this photo is pretty good, but you can see there’s not enough blur on the left side where the older woman is behind the primary subject. Here’s the same scenario without Lens Blur: Pixel I do prefer the Lens Blur variant of this photo, but there’s room for improvement in that shot. Here are a few more comparisons: Pixel Pixel with Lens Blur Pixel Pixel with Lens Blur The Lens Blur on the photo with the hourglass set is great, but the first photo doesn’t blur out a part of the woman in the yellow jacket. It’s this type of inconsistency that makes the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode superior. More often than not, though, as long as you have a clear subject and a fairly clutterless background, the effect should work perfectly. You can also use the refocus tool to fix the photo, but I never end up making much use of this — it’s usually better to retake the shot if possible. With Lens Blur, moving the phone up isn’t always reliable or comfortable. It often made errors, saying I moved too fast or that there was just an “error.” It also often doesn’t work in low-light scenarios most of the time — and all of that makes it unreliable. The iPhone’s Portrait mode does have its kinks — like how you need to make sure you’re a specific distance from the subject — but it’s much faster and consistent. It’s also better because it uses a blend of hardware and software to get the job done. The standard camera takes a photo, and then the second wide-angle sensor measures multiple layers to sense the depth-of-field and see how far the subject is. It’s why you can see the blur effect before you even snap a picture. You end up with a fairly sharp subject and a blurry background. Portrait mode only works on the iPhone 7 Plus, but Lens Blur can work on any device that can install the Google Camera app, notably Pixel and Nexus smartphones. Zoom Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has one feature that the Pixel doesn’t have: 2x optical hardware zoom. The iPhone also has digital zoom up to 10x, but the picture quality will decrease after you leave the 2x hardware zoom behind. iPhone 7 Plus This is a nice photo. Perhaps a little overexposed on the mountains, but it’s pretty good overall. This was taken with the iPhone 7 Plus. Now let’s zoom in with the second lens on Apple’s smartphone. iPhone 7 Plus with zoom This is an even better photo, and it’s thanks to the iPhone’s second “telephoto” lens. The mountains aren’t as sharp when you zoom in, but it’s still a phenomenal job for a phone camera. The Pixel doesn’t offer anything similar. It features digital zoom, like most smartphone cameras, and it’s something you don’t really want to use as your merely cropping the picture. You’ll still be able to frame some decent photos with the Pixel camera’s zoom, but it’s not going to look as good as the iPhone’s optical zoom. Here’s an example. Pixel zoomed in. Details aren’t sharp at all, and the grain in the photo is easily noticeable. There’s just no competing with the iPhone 7 Plus’ second camera until Google adds some form of optical zoom into next year’s Pixel smartphone. Winner: Google Pixel The real highlight here is the ease of use and the reliability of the Pixel camera. The speed at which I can open it and take a photo is impressive and goes a long way in quickly getting the shot I want. The lack of shutter lag makes me worry less about keeping my hands steady, at least when there’s plenty of light. It’s the same with the iPhone 7 Plus. Both cameras are dead easy to use and take great shots without much effort on your part. Related: The best smartphone camera you can buy The quality of the photos we took with the Pixel are on par — if not better — when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. Some of the differences between photos taken by both phones are things people will disagree on, but the big takeaway is this: There’s finally an exceptional and reliable camera on a phone that runs stock Android. That’s what’s best about the Pixel. I believe the Pixel’s camera takes more appealing photographs in most cases, but personal tastes will vary. The iPhone 7 Plus has the edge with special features like 2x zoom and a slicker bokeh effect, but the Pixel took better photos on the fly in our tests. The Pixel is the winner for everyday photography. You can read our full Pixel and iPhone 7 Plus reviews here.

No, really A cardboard desk? I won’t stand for it (actually I will) More like this Home Personal Tech Google makes it to third base with Home digital assistant A worthy challenger to the Echo, but no home run 5 Nov 2016 at 14:32, Kieren McCarthy Kieren McCarthy Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Security , Iana, Icann, Fcc, Google Recent Articles The hated Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal will soon be dead. Yay? Tech Trump: Silicon Valley steps into the valley of unhappiness GoPro drone moan brings more bad Karma Review There's really no way to write about Google Home, the search giant's digital assistant, without comparing it to the Amazon Echo. In fact, without the Echo's unexpected and extraordinary success, it's hard to imagine the Home would exist at all. So let's get it out of the way: the Echo just narrowly nudges the Google Home right now. But not by much, and Google's effort is actually better in some respects. It is also easy to see how the Echo's advantages may fall off over time. In short, Google has given the Echo a run for its money right out of the box. But let's step back briefly. What are we talking about really? Even though there has been a lot of excitement about the Echo, it has still not become a ubiquitous technology. There are those completely opposed to the idea of a box in your home listening out for voice commands and reacting accordingly by doing things like playing music, setting timers, providing useful snippets of information, even connecting to smart-home devices and turning on lights or turning up the heat. If you are one of those people, there is nothing about the Google Home that will change your mind; you are better off clicking out of this article right now and finding something else to do with the next five minutes. Then there are those who have an Echo but are intrigued to know what Google has brought to the game. And the answer is: competition. We can expect to see continued and rapid improvements in this area thanks to Google's arrival. That's good for customers of both products. Ecosystem But what you really want to know is: should I buy more Amazon Echos (or the mini-Echo called Dot) for my house? Or think about shifting to Google? And the answer is to wait. Why? Because what will end up differentiating the two will be the alliances and interactions they achieve with other manufacturers. As just one example: you can ask Google's Home to play music on a system in a different room – but currently only through Google's Chromecast streaming device. You can't do that at all with the Echo – but Amazon and Sonos have announced that next year you will be able to. Will Google also work with Sonos? Who knows? Will Amazon work with Chromecast? Possibly, but probably not. Do you already have a speaker system you want to use or are you thinking about buying one? The same approach – and uncertainty – can be applied to the whole range of other things that these digital assistants hope to connect to and which prove to be their real worth. The ecosystem is going to be the ultimate determinant of market leadership. That said, it's worth reflecting on the fact that Google Home has drawn so close to the Echo out the box. Amazon's black cylinder does has an advantage currently, but it is not light years ahead. Newbies And then the final group of people is those pondering whether to buy a digital assistant, possibly for the holidays. And to them, the interesting answer is: go ahead. Do it. The technology is mature enough to warrant it. There are bugs in Google Home, however. For example, it seems to have trouble working properly with music service Pandora. Several times it simply stopped playing songs after one or two songs. Sometimes it says it is going to play a radio station... and nothing happens. This is, obviously, rather frustrating. Also, just like the Echo in the early days, Google Home often struggles with requests and gives a stock answer like "sorry, I don't know how to help with that." Those struggles are fewer than when the Echo launched, but the Echo does have the edge here – mostly thanks to tens of thousands of customers using it now for well over a year. The Echo can handle many more variations of the same question. That said, the Home shows real promise here: when you hit on the "right" question, Google's response is often as good, if not better, than Amazon's. So long as Google is planning to learn from Home usage (rather than continue to rely mostly on its existing huge search database), it is easy to see how it could surpass the Echo. Some quick and dirty examples. Ask the Home what sounds a pig makes and it will play a clip of a pig snorting. Ask the Echo/Alexa and it tells you it has added a link in its app. Ask Home what is Spanish for 'sandwich' and it will joyfully tell you – complete with mild accent 'emparedado.' Ask Alexa and it says "I'm sorry I can't pronounce that, I have written it down" and it sends you to the app again. Duel That said, when asked how Alexander Hamilton died, the Echo gave a useful and relatively detailed rundown, whereas Home simply stated it was "by duel." The two devices were on a par when it came to a wide range of other requests: from shop closing times to setting timers to turning smart home equipment on and off (although we note that only the Echo works with the Ecobee smart thermostat; both work with Nest). Both also worked passably well with personal calendars. And both provide useful weather and news updates, seemingly from the same sources. Oh, and setup for both is easy. Where Google has fallen down is in not meeting the hype that it itself developed. When it launched last month, Google painted a picture of vastly superior intelligence and analysis: you would ask it questions and set up complex interactions and it would handle it easily. There is little evidence that that level of complexity exists right now beyond carefully choreographed demonstrations. For example, I asked Google Home to play the latest episode of the BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Amazingly, it figured this request out without needing any further input and started playing the latest episode. But then when I followed up with "no, not this episode, can you play the Desert Island Discs with Harry Rabinowitz," it drew a total blank. The intelligence is only going down one level. So those are the software and ecosystem capabilities. What will be a key decider for many people looking at the devices will be things inherent to the device itself. Here again there is a split and it will fall to individual taste. Cost: The Home is $50 cheaper than the Echo and costs $130. This might be a decider for some but let's be honest, these devices are not essentials so we suspect the price differential is less a factor than everything else. Look: The Home is shorter and a little stubbier. It is white and has changeable color bases. The Echo is a taller, thinner, black cylinder. Getting personal, both this reviewer and, critically, his wife, prefer the Home in this regard. Sound: Again, it's a personal thing. The Echo has slightly better speakers (tested by cranking them up to max) but the Home has a warmer quality to it which makes music more pleasurable. That said, the spoken word is a little cleaner and crisper on the Echo, so radio sounds a little better. Mic: The microphones are critical with this device, for obvious reasons. The two edge cases are when there is a lot of residual noise in the room when you ask the device to do something, and when you are in another room shouting out a command in the hope it will be heard and acted on. In both cases, the Echo performed better. But not so much that it was a problem for the Home. Wake word: You wake up the Echo by using the wake-word "Alexa." This provides a pleasant, personable feel to the device which is nice. The Home, however, is woken by saying "OK, Google" or "Hey Google." Frankly, for this reviewer, constantly saying "OK, Google" feels a little uncomfortable and constantly reminds you of the company rather than feeling like a personal assistant. It feels impersonal. This may seem like a small thing, but when you have to say it every time, having a person's name to say feels much less like an imposition. This single factor alone may give the Echo the edge in usage. In short, Google Home has done amazingly well right out the gates. It trails the Amazon Echo, but only slightly, and it has the potential to steam ahead, at least in terms of intelligence of answers, as the system gets much wider general use by the public. This reviewer prefers the Home on a device level but not enough to be evangelical about it, and can easily see why others may prefer the Echo. The big decider will be in the next 6-12 months when it becomes clear how much each company can persuade other manufacturers to work with its system. Amazon is clearly out ahead in this respect, but can Google catch up or will it go the Apple route and decide that the best solution for everyone will be to buy lots of interoperable Google products? Only time will tell. In the meantime, I have left both devices in the kitchen of the family home to see which one gets more attention. The Google Home is available now, in the US, for $129. The Amazon Echo is $180. We'll let you know when Google makes it available in the UK. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 66 Comments More from The Register Home Office extends mega 18-year Fujitsu contract So much for breaking up the SIs then 3 Comments It's finally happened: Hackers are coming for home routers en masse SoHopeless 55 Comments User group spawns home lab how-to community Open Homelab Project promises to help you build the test rig your boss won't fund 2 Comments Home Office staff: Over 100 of our work mobiles lost or pinched last year Where did you say you'd run those mega-database apps again? 12 Comments Blighty's Home Office database blunders will deprive hundreds of GB driving licences Independent report slams officials' cock-ups 50 Comments Feds collar chap who allegedly sneaked home US hacking blueprints Bloke, 51, worked at Snowden's old haunt Booz Allen 17 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

One of these tests was a series of search shortcuts that had a very distinct circle design in the Google Now (now known as Feed) page right below the search bar. That interface didn’t spread to a wider user base, but it appears that Google is still toying with the idea, albeit in a different look.

Us based We are working on Drupal Theme, laravel web development services,jquery for android app development, phonegap iphone app development also Codeigniter Web Development. android-nougat-7-1-for-nexus   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Android App Development * App Development * Android App By Industry: * MobilePHOENIX - Nov. 5, 2016 - PRLog -- The journey of Android from Marshmallow to Nougat has been rewarded with various latest interesting features. Android is always leading the mobile applications market for all the industries. Android app development companies are highly supported by Google through the features it provides. Nougat is all about improving pre-existing features, extended functionality and expanding the stock of android. The little surprises packed with the O.S are attractive enough to make any user fall in love with it. The latest features introduced works in improving upon the overall Android experience. Let's take a look at what's new in the OS introduced by Google: Split screen Use two apps at a time. Google has added multi-window support for all android devices running android 7.0. To activate multi-window mode, long press the recent apps button while in an app. The android app you are currently using will go on the top of the screen with a list of recently used apps visible along the bottom. The user can choose the second app to use from the list. Notification prioritization The user can tell android about the notification information to be displayed on the lock screen within the notification area of the setting. Long pressing a notification can give to access its priority settings or swiping it a little to the side and tapping the gear icon to access the options. Multiple notifications from the same app will not get bundled up together saving more space and allowing dismissing or expanding for individual attention. This feature will be useful in managing various android apps. Quick settings A list of five toggles that is always present at the top of the notification shade. The small arrow on the right side will take the user to the full setting page. The user can also rearrange the tiles or even replacement of the tiles with others by simply tapping the edit button at the bottom right. Long pressing a tile will take the user to its full setting menu screen. Improved DOZE OFF functionality The new version of Doze works after your screen has been off for a certain period of time. Earlier the Doze function works only when the device is stationary completely which is difficult as sitting at one place with our device in our pocket can move a lot by a simple movement of your legs. But in nougat, the Doze feature works even when the device is not stationary. Easy reply to messages The user can reply to messages from apps like facebook messenger, hangouts or in-built messenger from the notification bar directly. No need to bounce between multiple android apps to continue a conversation. The reply to messages can be done simply by taping the reply button or user can use the reply options suggested. Android app development is now more versatile and the companies developing android applications should keep in mind the latest features while creating an android application.

Home News Operating Systems Google introduced Android nine years ago today Today, Android is the most popular operating system by far, which isn't surprising since so many phone manufacturers use it for their devices By: Lana Jelic | Operating Systems News | Posted: 1 week, 2 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA A recent report showed that Android phones hold 88% of the market. Global shipments hit 375 million units in the third quarter of 2016, and 328.6 million of them were Android phones.     The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released on October 22th, 2008. However, the history of Android OS started much earlier.   The Android OS was initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005 for at least $50 million. Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move.   Speculations continued through 2006, and Google worked on a prototype codenamed Sooner that initially had no touchscreen, but instead featured a physical keyboard. They later re-designed it to compete with other announced devices such as LG Prada and Apple iPhone. However, Google didn't introduce its own devices until 2010 when they launched the Nexus series of smartphones and tablets.   But the move to buy Android Inc. paid off, and in 2007 they introduced the Android OS.   On November 5, 9 years ago, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as HTC, Sony and Samsung, wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, unveiled itself, with a goal to develop open standards for mobile devices. That day, Android was unveiled as its first product, a mobile device platform built on the Linux kernel.   Today, Android is the most popular operating system by far, which isn't surprising since so many phone manufacturers use it for their devices. Android has become a dominant force in global application development as well and has sparked countless innovation in both hardware and software over these years since its release.

ChromeBook Review Chromebook vs. Laptop – Which is Right For You? Chris Stobing Updated November 11, 2016 Shares Can't decide on a Chromebook or laptop? Read our guide to find out which is right for you. Chromebooks vs. Laptops. It’s a battle that’s been raging for nearly five years now, with plenty of good points being made by those on both sides of the argument. But which portable computer is right for you, and which might hold you back? Read on to find out. Chromebook vs Laptop   Chromebook Laptop Operating System Chrome OS Linux, Windows, OS X 3rd Party Apps Allowed Highly Averse to Malware and Viruses WiFi Expandable Memory Expandable Storage Price Range Low to Medium Medium to High Operating Systems The Chrome OS is limited to Android like apps, which means 3rd party ones aren’t allowed. The three main competing laptop operating systems include OS X on Macbooks, Windows 10 on third-party laptops (Toshiba, Asus, Microsoft, etc), and Linux. Chrome OS, or in this case Chromebooks, which entered the fray not too long ago and is similar to that of Android, certainly isn’t for everyone.  However, it still serves its (limited) purpose pretty well across the board. I’ve personally used a Chromebook for two years as my road laptop, and not once has the OS ever crashed on me. There might be an occasional stutter during a 1080p video on YouTube, but otherwise the lean, mean design of the Chrome OS prevents it from experiencing any significant hangups. Windows is the exact opposite of this, of course. By this point the word “Windows” has basically become synonymous with “pulling your hair out”, and although OS X enjoyed a few years of flawless bliss when Macbooks were gaining in popularity, its reliability has since dropped quite a bit. That said, one of the main reasons both OS X and Windows have problems at all is because they support third-party software and applications, while Chrome OS does not. Last there’s Linux. Technically there are ways you can install a custom Linux build on a Chromebook, so if you’re not totally sold on Chrome OS but still want a new laptop for not a lot of money, check out this guide on which models can support the operating system swap.

The fact is Chrome OS is an extremely closed off ecosystem, one which only allows you to perform a few select functions and not much else. Google keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be “installed” on a Chromebook, if you could even call it that. Almost all of the apps you “install” on your machine don’t actually run locally. Instead Chrome places an icon in your start menu, which is only a link to a website that supports the “program” in Flash or HTML5. The only true apps installed on the machine are the Chrome web browser, as well as offline versions of Docs, Sheets, and Google’s PowerPoint competitor, Slides. Macbooks and PCs on the other hand are made to be customized, and come with the option to install literally hundreds of thousands of different programs and types of software at once. If you need something that can run Photoshop, play your favorite games, or even run an .FLV video file, then a Windows laptop or Macbook will be the de facto choice. CPU and RAM Currently, all Chromebooks ship with Intel processors. Due to a deal inked between Google and Intel, almost all the Chromebooks released last year (and coming in 2016) are equipped with Intel processors. For the AMD faithful this may be an issue, but for most, the Intel mobile line and 5th-generation Core processors can handle Chrome OS just fine. It’s difficult to make a direct comparison of the amount of “power” you get from a Chromebook compared to a standard Windows laptop or Apple Macbook, largely because each one comes with an OS that uses its resources differently. Chrome OS is light, so it runs well on worse (less powerful) hardware.  So the comparison is a moot one. If you were to install Windows on a laptop that had identical specs it would run slower, simply for the fact that Windows has tons of extraneous processes and tasks it runs in the background while nothing else is going on. In short, Windows requires more horsepower to run, much like a big truck requires a larger engine over a smaller car. Storage One area where Chromebooks still need to catch up is with onboard storage. Because they’re made to be cheap and light, almost all Chromebooks come with an SSD opposed to a standard HDD, which ups the cost of manufacturing. As such, it’s rare to find any model of Chromebook with more than 32GB of available onboard storage. To compensate, most Chromebooks will come with 100GB of free cloud storage, provided by Google’s own Drive service. If the idea of keeping all your data on the cloud doesn’t sound like your cup of tea however, it might be better to simply go with a standard laptop instead. Laptops on the other hand come in pretty much any storage configuration you can think of. Want your operating system on an SSD and your games/movies on an HDD backup? There’s a laptop for that. Don’t mind long loading times and just want as much space as possible? There’s a 3TB hard drive just for you.  Screen The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers an excellent screen for a Chromebook. In the pursuit of making these laptops as affordable as possible, sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Screen quality is an area where almost all Chromebooks lag woefully behind the 1366 x 768 curve, and it’s expected that unless it’s a model that specifically touts its HD-capability, you probably won’t be showing it off to your co-workers anytime soon. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was our number #1 pick of the lot for the best Chromebook 2016, a title it won in large part thanks to its absolutely 1920 x 1080 HD IPS screen. If you plan on watching a lot of Netflix or working with color-senstive creative materials online, this model is one of very few that would be able to handle it. On the laptop side of things – it’s a bit all over the place. Some laptops sport stunning 4K screens that can play Blu-Ray content at its absolute peak, while others are so grainy you can barely read a paragraph of text on them without having to adjust your glasses twice. Where touchscreens are concerned, while Windows does maintain the advantage on the sheer number of touchscreen laptops available, many of them are sub-par in quality.  Comparatively, the  ASUS Flip Chromebook made our top Chromebooks of 2016 list both for it’s solid design, and a touchscreen that responds to even the slightest graze of your finger. Keyboard and Trackpad While some Chromebooks are built as cheap as possible and come with keyboards or trackpads to match (looking at you, HP), others, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2, are an absolute dream to type on. Because Chromebooks are made as machines that can help you with work, school, or generally getting a lot of typing done, most of the keyboards on a Chromebook will do the job with flying colors. The trackpads on the other hand are a bit hit or miss. Cost-compared against Windows machines, you’re going to get a similar deal in quality. If you opt for a Macbook however, the trackpad will clearly be superior due to the increased price and money spent on the overall quality of the surrounding hardware. Webcam This one is a bit of an even draw. Chromebooks may come with some cheap components, but Google knows that of all the features that people want on a laptop, the webcam should be up to par. Comparing webcams from several of the top Chromebooks on the market right now against what you’d get in a Windows laptop or Macbook five times the cost, it’s clear that any Chromebook worth its salt will have a webcam that works in most lighting situations, even if you still can’t use it to call someone over Skype. Price Categorically, for the specs you get and the ease of use you should expect out of a device, price is where Chromebooks truly shine. Because Google doesn’t charge third-party companies for use of their OS, manufacturers can use the resources that would have otherwise been spent licensing the operating system on better specs. This means that on a direct 1:1 cost comparison, the hardware you get inside a Chromebook will always edge out what you might find in a competing Windows PC. As for Chromebooks vs. Macbooks; it’s not even a contest. Apple marks up their products by the handful compared to Google. And while a baseline 2015 Macbook Air will run you upwards of $999 at the checkout counter, a comparable Chromebook with the same specs would be nearly three times less, at $330. Read: Best Ultrabook 2016 The whole draw of Chromebooks is that they offer solid hardware at half the cost of what you’d spend on any other laptop. Although they may not have much software to speak of and their onboard storage capacities border on pitiful, you’re getting a fully-functional laptop at a discount so steep it would put lesser companies straight out of business. Which is Right for You, Chromebook or Laptop? In the war between Chromebooks vs. laptops – it looks like the winner comes down to personal preference. The only way you’ll really be able to decide if a Chromebook is right for you (or any members of your family), is to know what you’re going to use it for the most ahead of time. If you only need a machine that goes online, opens web pages, and lets you type to your heart’s content, a Chromebook is the perfect pick. If you think you might need more flexibility down the line however, it might be better to spend your cash on a Windows laptop or Macbook instead. Chrome OS is great for your kid’s first laptop or as a backup while you’re punching out the yearly expense report from an airport terminal.  But it lags behind when it comes to supporting most types of media playback, running third-party software, or gaming on the go. They’re cheap, they’re light, but they also don’t do a whole lot. If that sounds like the perfect marriage of just enough features at just a low enough price, then a Chromebook might be right for you.

"For the first time in three years, Amazon has been declared as the most attractive Internet brand (96th rank overall)...," said the study carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA). Google emerged as the second-most attractive Internet brand in the country while its overall ranking was 102. The study was based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. Flipkart grabbed the third position in the Internet category, jumping 221 slots to 125th rank across India, while Snapdeal saw an improvement of 63 ranks to 302nd on the list. Social networking giant Facebook rose 202 ranks in the national rankings to 157th position in 2016, and was placed fourth in the category, the study said. "The Internet category has seen a surprising shift in the top ranks, with Amazon ranking higher than Google, implying a serious improvement in the appeal of conducting transactions online," TRA Chief Executive Officer N Chandramouli said. Flipkart CEO’s response to Amazon’s No.1 claim Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal said the company's sales (or gross merchandize value of items sold on the platform) during the festive season was 70-80% higher than that of Amazon's and that it accomplished this at a third of the costs borne by the latter. ​ This is apparent from the fact that out of the 29 brands listed in the Internet category in 2016, 11 brands were online retailers, he added. "Expected brands like Shopclues (461 rank) and Uber (483) were listed in the internet category along with some surprising entrants like Koovs (477), Voonik (937) and Oyo Rooms (948)," he said. The list was topped by Korean electronics giant LG while the Tata conglomerate slipped in ranking to the seventh spot this year (from 5 in 2014 and 4 in 2015). Other Internet brands in the tally included WhatsApp (339), Paytm (341), Myntra (397), Youtube (500), Twitter (506), Ola (605) and JustDial (786).

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Amazon Echo And Google Home Set To Battle For Holiday Dominance Posted: Nov 5 2016, 4:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 3:33am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The contender to Amazon's digital assistant home device has arrived. The fight is on this Holidays. Who will win? Amazon stood up Google and Apple with the release of Amazon Echo two years ago. That is right. While Google was still playing with sandbox toys, Amazon has shipped a device that can answer all your questions you ask out loud in your home. For two years there was nothing comparable. Now Google finally ships the Google Home device, a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Amazon launched on November 7 an Amazon Echo deal with the lowest price in the history to celebrate the 2nd birthday of the Amazon Echo. The Amozon Echo sells for $140.39 for a limited time. Google Home comes out of the gate with a $50 lower price. Google Home sells for $129 at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. These retailers make a big deal out of the Google Home launch and feature the product prominently in their stores. Google is set to go full in with the Google Home this Holiday season and attack Amazon's market share with the Echo.  The Amazon Echo had a two year head start and Amazon used this time to get a long list of developers behind the Alexa platform. There are more than hundred Amazon Echo Skills that enable the device to play music, order food and control your home. Google Home is behind, but also offers a developer platform that will quickly add these skills. So which home assistant is better? You can't go wrong with either one. A side to side test asking questions to Echo and Home on Digital Trends shows that Google Home is a bit better in answering knowledge questions. Amazon needs to be careful not to get behind in that field. For instance Alexa fails to answer the question what koalas eat. The Amazon Echo sold for $149 on Prime Day earlier this year and in the Black Friday sale last year. Amazon is in full control of the pricing of the Amazon Echo and it will be clear that the Amazon Black Friday 2016 deal will be at least as low as $129 to match Google Home. We could even imagine that Amazon goes in the offensive and prices the Amazon Echo for under $100. Amazon has its e-commerce eco system behind the Amazon Echo. Google does not have that advantage. For Amazon, the Echo is just another way to get people to shop on Amazon.com. Amazon Prime members can use their voice to order anything on Amazon.com just by asking Alexa on their Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Amazon Fire TV, or Fire tablet. Amazon will even have hundreds of exclusive deals just for voice shoppers this holiday season listed at www.amazon.com/alexadeals. You can have Alexa tell you her deals by just asking: "Alexa, what are your deals?" Jeff Bezos' Amazon imperium will not let Google to easily waltz in between them and shoppers. There are no rumors yet about Amazon releasing a new Amazon Echo 2. A new Echo that leaps Google Home in performance and specifications would be the best weapon, but it is not clear what new hardware features would be improving the user experience. The Amazon Echo comes in white and black and is available on amazon.com and at Best Buy.

RCS enables a host of enhancements not possible over SMS including high-resolution photo and video sharing, confirmation that a recipient has read your message, group chat and freedom from that annoying 160 character limit. RCS isn’t exactly a new concept (it was conceived in 2007 with the initial release pushed out in 2012) nor are the features it delivers. Roughly a decade ago, the wireless landscape looked nothing like it does today. Wireless carriers, which for years had made their money selling service plans that focused on metered talk minutes, were now marketing unlimited text messaging as their key perk. It wasn’t long before services like BlackBerry Messenger and Apple’s iMessage came along, offering users a way to circumvent carrier texting and rendering SMS-focused service plans useless. As additional third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger emerged over the years, SMS more or less fell by the wayside. As mentioned, RCS has been around for years with several carriers including AT&T and T-Mobile having launched apps based on the technology under various names. What Google is looking to do now, however, is get everyone on the same page by baking support for RCS into the standard Android Messenger app… or at least, that seems to be the goal. As The Verge highlights, Messenger is just one of the three messaging apps that Google ships on its Pixel phones (Allo for consumers, Messenger for carriers and Hangouts for enterprise). Google says that come next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android pre-loaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging experience. Those currently using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will have their messaging experience upgraded automatically via app update. Furthermore, those using other Android devices can grab the Messenger app from the Play Store should they so choose. One can’t help but wonder if this unifying tactic is too little, too late. Third-party apps like those mentioned above already have massive user bases and advanced features like end-to-end encryption. As of this past February, for example, WhatsApp said it had more than a billion active monthly users. I’m struggling to see how a carrier messaging app is going to gain much headway in an already crowded and established market but I digress. The search giant said it looks forward to launching RCS with more partners in the coming months.

CNET 05/11/2016 Sean Hollister © Provided by CNET James Martin/CNET On a cloudy day this May, in the dull fluorescent light of a plain white Google conference room, Rafa Camargo, Richard Wooldridge and Blaise Bertrand told CNET their plan to disrupt the phone market. Ara, a Lego-like phone with modular parts, would let buyers snap on a better camera, additional batteries or any other creative hardware a developer might dream up. It was set to be the first phone entirely designed by Google, the three men claimed. Then the Ara project was abruptly shelved. But now, all three of those men work for Building 8 -- a secretive new division of Facebook. There, they've been joined by an impressive list of heavy hitters that reads like a who's who of the tech world: Motorola, Tesla, Apple and Amazon, in addition to that contingent of Google ex-pats. So what, exactly, is this superteam of designers, engineers and manufacturing experts working on? Nobody outside of Menlo Park knows for sure, but the hires -- and at least one under-the-radar acquisition -- seem to indicate two things: it's mobile, and it may be modular. Whatever it turns out to be, building hardware at this scale represents a major shift for Facebook. The company's first attempt at hardware -- a 2013 joint venture with HTC that became known as the " Facebook phone" -- was a fiasco, discounted to 99 cents mere weeks after its debut. Since then, though, the company has doubled down, first with its $2 billion purchase of VR headset maker Oculus in 2014, and now with what appears to be a far more ambitious hardware endeavor with Building 8.  What's Building 8? © Reuters Building 8 isn't an actual building; Facebook's Menlo Park offices are numbered 10 through 20. (Building 20 not pictured.) Originally, it sounded like Building 8 was a skunkworks where Facebook could prototype a whole bunch of new technologies -- like 360-degree video cameras -- and figure out the fastest way to get them into consumers' hands, usually through partnerships. That's what Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer suggested to the The Wall Street Journal, and it's what was widely assumed when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he'd hired Regina Dugan to lead Building 8. Dugan is the former head of both the US Department of Defense's DARPA research arm, and Google's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) research lab. Zuckerberg suggested, in an April 2016 blog post, that Building 8 would pursue "augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, connectivity and other important areas" -- which sounds pretty sciencey, to be sure. But the division's job postings and recent hires tell a slightly different story -- beginning with the Building 8 mission statement you'll find at the top of each job post. Here's the mission statement in full: Building 8 brings together world-class experts to develop and ship groundbreaking products at the intersection of hardware, software, and content. We have a clear mandate to ship products at scale. In particular, seemingly impossible products that define new categories that advance Facebook's mission of connecting the world. The B8 team will apply DARPA-style breakthrough development at the intersection of ambitious science and product development. It will operate on aggressive, fixed timelines, with extensive use of partnerships in universities, small and large businesses. Building 8 is all about shipping hardware, it seems. And could "seemingly impossible products" include an ambitious modular phone like Ara? Facebook didn't reply to a request for comment.  Phone experts wanted CNET analyzed nearly 50 Facebook job postings, past and present, and dug through dozens of employee profiles on LinkedIn to see the big picture. It soon became clear: Facebook isn't just building a lab in hopes of spinning out a few new startup companies. Instead, Facebook is hiring over a dozen different heads of what appear to be a dozen distinct departments within Building 8 -- including industrial design, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, device software, applications and services, manufacturing, supply chain and even customer service. Many of those heads of product are being asked to hire their own teams from scratch. In other words, Facebook appears to be building an organization that could conceptualize, design, produce, ship and sell hardware, and even deal with customers after the fact. (Who needs customer service and return policies for prototypes?) Only two of Facebook's new department heads are devoted to "skunkworks" and "partnerships," respectively, and few of the job postings ask for experience across the wide range of disciplines you might expect for a research lab. But many of them ask for people with mobile experience -- Android in particular. For instance, this posting for a lead electrical engineering systems architect specifically asks for experience with mobile processors, antennas and thermal design, and these two for a camera software engineer and a kernel software engineer each require five years of experience working with mobile processors and an "understanding of Android Frameworks." The heads of product software, product engineering and hardware each need experience leading teams that have brought "smart phone (Android, iOS) and/or consumer electronics" to market. There are also strong hints that the new head of software applications and services will be tasked with developing Android apps for the hardware Building 8 will make. Two other jobs specifically mention Facebook's intent to build "compelling consumer-facing products on the Android platform," and yet another hints that Facebook may sell accessories to go along with its products. Key talent According to their LinkedIn profiles, many of Building 8's recent hires reinforce the idea that Facebook is pursuing hardware in a big way: - Nathan Kelly, Building 8's new head of global supply chain, previously helped build supply chains for Sonos, Tesla, HP/Palm, Microsoft and Sony Ericsson, according to his LinkedIn profile. - Rich Heley, the new head of manufacturing, spent a decade at Apple figuring out how to mass produce aluminum enclosures for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac -- all the way back to the first MacBook Pro -- then spent three years at Tesla, finishing as VP of product technology. - Furhan Zafar previously directed the supply chain for Motorola's Moto Maker -- an effort that let buyers pick different phone backs and different accent colors for their phone's buttons and grills before they shipped to customers. - Tim McCune, Building 8's new head of systems engineering, spent 17 years at Motorola and a brief stint at Apple as well. - Richard Wooldridge, the new COO of Building 8, wasn't just the logistics behind Google's modular Ara handset -- he also spent four years leading the global supply chain at Motorola, including Moto's effort to build a factory in the US for the first Moto X phone. - Rafa Camargo, Building 8's new head of product engineering, led development on Google's Ara phone, after a year and a half at Amazon's Lab126 hardware group working on the Amazon Fire Phone and 13 years at Motorola on such iconic projects as the Droid, Razr, even the StarTAC flip phone. - Viresh Rustagi, the new head of device software at Building 8, was the head of software for Google's Ara as well -- after a two-year-plus stint managing a software dev team for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets and set-top boxes, and 12 years working on software for mobile processors at Broadcom. - Blaise Bertrand, Facebook's new head of creative, spent three years designing for Motorola and 12 at noted design firm IDEO, in addition to seven months at Google ATAP working on the Ara phone. These high-level execs are just the start. Building 8 has also snapped up a number of former Apple employees, including an executive recruiter, and is currently hiring three other recruiters and a recruiting manager to expand its collection of talent. It's also worth noting that, for now, all of these hardware efforts appear to be separate from the ones inside Facebook proper: the company already had its own VP of hardware and supply chain to help build its data centers and networking infrastructure. Oculus, the Facebook virtual-reality subsidiary, has its own separate hardware team too, plus its own research arm based in Seattle. Will Google's modular phone live on? Even if Facebook just hired four key members of the Google Ara team to lead its manufacturing and supply chain efforts, and even if it has a number of other mobile experts on the payroll, we can't say for sure they'll be working on a phone. All of Facebook's new expertise could go towards anything else that uses mobile processors, radios and the Android OS -- such as headsets, tablets, watches, smart home and other internet-of-things devices. Or something entirely new. And even if it is a phone, it isn't necessarily a modular one. Having failed to convince Google, the team may have given up on that idea. But perhaps not: In September, one month after the Ara team jumped ship, Building 8 bought a hardware startup called Nascent Objects -- which just so happened to be developing a modular consumer electronics platform, too. At the time of the acquisition, Building 8's Dugan implied that Nascent's tech would be used for fast prototyping: "Imagine designing, building and delivering a hardware product in just weeks. Instead of months, or even years," Dugan wrote on her Facebook page. "Together, we hope to create hardware at a speed that's more like software." But perhaps Dugan meant that Nascent's modular tech could help consumers build their own hardware -- the same idea behind the Ara modular phone. Back in May, in that Google conference room, the ambition behind Ara was huge. "We want to create a hardware ecosystem on the scale of the software app ecosystem," said Camargo. Wooldridge promised his team would provide hardware and technical support, and help indie hardware designers get their snap-on modules certified by federal regulatory agencies, so that even a "bedroom student" could add a new feature to their phone. Bertrand explained how fashionable it could be, and how attractive for big brands, to have decorative phone pieces that a user could change on the fly. Now, they're all together again, inside a company that -- unlike Google -- wouldn't be disrupting its own business by competing with existing Android hardware partners. (Facebook is a must-have app on more than a billion people's phones, but the company doesn't make any mobile hardware yet.) Plus, they're leading a division with access to "hundreds of millions of dollars" over the next few years, according to Zuckerberg. The ultimate pivot It's possible that Facebook's hardware ambitions never see the light of day. Consider Apple's secretive Project Titan program, which reportedly staffed up and spent millions on a self-driving car initiative that, so far, has only produced several rounds of layoffs and strategy changes. Reportedly. But it seems, at least, that Facebook is following the same path as its arch-rival, Snapchat. Until a few months ago, Snapchat's social app was its only product. But the company recently rebranded itself as a camera company and surprised the world with Spectacles, a Snapchat-specific hardware product it had developed in secret (after stealthily hiring its own group of wearable tech experts). Facebook has a bigger user base than Snapchat, more money and more hardware experts. If the company unveils its own phone -- or mobile accessory -- in the next year or two, it wouldn't be too surprising.

Try this tool By: Rohit Arora Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 15:33 [IST] Artificial Intelligence and Chat Bots are considered to be the next big thing. These two technologies are supposed to provide support or sometimes control everything around us, be it cars, lights, TVs, mobile apps, services, and other electronic devices. And we are not talking about distant future, it's already happening around us. Big names like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. are implementing them in their new products, for instance- the latest Google Pixel handsets are backed by AI tool Google Assistant, Apple Siri is already quite popular and Facebook is also using chat bots in its Messenger app. SEE ALSO: Reliance Jio's Quest for Better and Smarter Smartphone Experience: 5 Promising Things to Know The day is not far when everyone will have a personal bot offering its services to manage their entire digital life and make things much easier for them. Having said that, there's a great demand for young minds who can think out of the box and create bots to execute digital tasks seamlessly. This is where Gupshup, a cross-channel bot platform offers its services. SEE ALSO: Here are 5 Tricks To Get Better Google Search Results The company claims that it used by over 30,000 developers building services that process over 4 billion messages per month and over 150 billion cumulative. The platform has recently unveiled two bot building tools to create chatbots on its platform, a 'Flow Bot Builder' and a 'Template Bot Builder' using which even non coders can build chat bots. Let's find out how it works. Create Bots with drag and drop The talking point of the new platform is that it doesn't ask for coding skills. Users can use the simple drag-and-drop tools and pre-selected menus to create bots. Flow Bot Builder As per company, the Flow Bot builder makes the process entirely code free. Using a graphical, easy-to-use, web-based interface, users simply design the conversational flow for the bot. The company has also cited an example, where a business analyst can quickly define the navigation flow with a series of menu choices. Flow Bot Builder makes it simple to create a variety of engaging chat bots, from informative to entertaining, without entering a single line of code. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Template Bot Builder Talking about the Template Bot Builder, the company says that it gives entrepreneurs and small business owners the ability to capitalize on the exponential growth of chatbots using pre-defined templates. These templates are fully customizable to fit their audience and brand. For example, a restaurant owner can use a pre-defined bot template that already has food browsing and ordering functionality coded in it. Serves the need of SMBs and individual coders The new tool combines the company's existing IDE Bot Builder (a tool for technical developers) to cater the needs of everyone from enterprises and small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to individual bot fans across the globe. We believe this platform can come handy for young minds and SME's who wants to create something new but often find themselves handicapped when it comes to building bots. These tools can help them create new bots, which have become quite crucial for online ventures in India and world. Let us know about your views regarding this new platform in the comments.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: Google and Blizzard are opening up StarCraft II to anyone who wants to teach artificial intelligence systems how to conduct warfare. Researchers can now use Google's DeepMind A.I. to test various theories for ways that machines can learn to make sense of complicated systems, in this case Blizzard's beloved real-time strategy game. In StarCraft II, players fight against one another by gathering resources to pay for defensive and offensive units. It has a healthy competitive community that is known for having a ludicrously high skill level. But considering that DeepMind A.I. has previously conquered complicated turn-based games like chess and go, a real-time strategy game makes sense as the next frontier. The companies announced the collaboration today at the BlizzCon fan event in Anaheim, California, and Google's DeepMind A.I. division posted a blog about the partnership and why StarCraft II is so ideal for machine-learning research. If you're wondering how much humans will have to teach A.I. about how to play and win at StarCraft, the answer is very little. DeepMind learned to beat the best go players in the world by teaching itself through trial and error. All the researchers had to do was explain how to determine success, and the A.I. can then begin playing games against itself on a loop while always reinforcing any strategies that lead to more success. For StarCraft, that will likely mean asking the A.I. to prioritize how long it survives and/or how much damage it does to the enemy's primary base. Or, maybe, researchers will find that defining success in a more abstract way will lead to better results, discovering the answers to all of this is the entire point of Google and Blizzard teaming up. blizzard games google ← Related Links → A Naked Black Hole Is Screaming Through the Universe Human Go Champion 'Speechless' After 2nd Loss To Machine Submission: Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II Blizzard Launches A Professional Sports League For 'Overwatch' Face Electrodes Let You Taste and Chew In Virtual Reality Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II More | Reply Login Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

One huge difference (Score:4, Insightful) by Solandri ( 704621 ) writes: on Saturday November 05, 2016 @05:13AM (#53217871) Games like Chess, Go, Tic-Tac-Toe always let both players see the complete world state. Armed with that knowledge, it's easy to be systematic and deterministic. Games like Poker and Starcraft hide part of the world state from each player, forcing them to guess at the parts they can't see. That opens up the possibility of one player bluffing - leading the opponent down the wrong decision tree because he's fooled into thinking the part of the world state he can't see is different from what it really is. I don't think this is something an AI can "solve". Certainly one could optimize it, so that it becomes damn good at guessing when a certain player is bluffing or not. But put it up against a different player and all that "learned" experience becomes useless, or even counter-productive. Or even pit it against the same player who's aware he's playing against the AI which beat him last time, and he'll simply do something he would never normally do to throw off the computer. It's a difficult enough problem that in pretty much all commercial computer games with a fog of war feature, the computer is just programmed to cheat by ignoring the fog and seeing everything.

The Nexus carried a stripped-down version of Android with no bloatware or funny skins. It was beloved by developers for its simplicity, for getting code updates promptly, and for being cheap. The Pixel only has one of these features, but Google is going for a slightly different market this time around. There's a new skin applied – although it's very tastefully done – and the updates come just as thick and fast. But the Pixel XL has had a major upgrade in price – $769 for the 32GB version we tested as opposed to $499 for a similarly specced Nexus 6P. That's a fairly massive jump, made in part because Google now wants the Pixel line to be about high-end smartphone buyers, not just developers. But is it worth the price? Feel the curves The Pixel XL is slightly more polished in design and there have been some major improvements on the hardware front. The 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm phone has an aluminum body shell, although for some reason the top half of the back is covered with the same Gorilla glass that makes up the screen. It's now a particularly weighty handset at 168g, although with a pricey phone, a cover is always a smart investment and that'll bring the bulk and heaviness up a notch. Two-tone phone back HTC built the handset for Google, and design-wise it's not very inspiring. Like the iPhone 7, HTC went for the rounded corners look but the Pixel XL has none of the smoothness of design that Sir Jony and the Apple crew managed to pull off. Another difference between this and the iPhone 7, and some other Android handsets, is water resistance. The Pixel XL isn't water resistant, so if you're prone to dropping handsets in the toilet (hint, take it out of your breast pocket before flushing) then look around for another model. However, the Pixel XL does have something the iPhone 7 doesn't have – a 3.5mm audio jack built into the top of the device. The power and volume buttons are on the right-hand side, with the SIM card slot on the left, and a USB C slot and twin microphones are built into the base. The 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED 534ppi display is a major selling point for the Pixel. It's clear as a bell, and works very well in bright sunlight and in the evening. It handled gaming and video playback as well as anything else on the market and was clear and sharp for ebooks and other text. The cameras are also rather impressive. The 12mp rear camera produces sharp and clear images, and is excellent in poor light conditions, and the 8mp front-facing camera is better than most – possibly thanks to Google wanting to make its Duo videoconferencing app more usable. In drop testing, the phone handled multiple seven-foot drops onto carpet and a three-foot fall onto a wooden floor (thanks to a curious cat) without a scratch or crack to be seen. Get a good case for this phone and it should last until its hardware is obsolescent. Under the covers In the heart of the Pixel is Qualcomm's super-speedy Snapdragon 821 processor, backed up by 4GB of RAM. This makes the phone one of the most powerful out there and it shows in performance testing. The 3450 mAh battery is the same size as with the Nexus 6P, and Google claims that it's good for 14 hours of internet use and 23 days' standby time. The standby figure seems accurate – the standby mode is excellent, but 14 hours of internet seems optimistic; we barely got 12 hours of hard use out of the device. Google also says that users can get seven hours of battery use from just 15 minutes due to fast charging. This also seems optimistic. In recharging tests it took around 35 minutes to get half of the battery charged and 15 minutes was only long enough to get it a third full. It might be a function of the fast charging system, but getting the phone to a full charge took a comparatively long time. The minimum time we got to hit 100 per cent was 111 minutes, because once you get past 90 per cent, charging rates tail off drastically. On the storage front, the Pixel we tested came with 32GB available and upping that to 128GB will cost an extra $100. 32GB seems a little stingy when the phone costs this much, particularly as there's no SD card slot, but the thinking at Google is that cloud storage is the way forward and gives Pixel owners unlimited photo storage. Inside the handset there are the usual grab bag of sensors, but Google has done some sterling work in making these even more useful. The image stabilization features on the camera for video in particular are very good indeed. NFC is built in for use with Android Pay and other apps, but once again Google has decided not to include wireless charging for the device. While there's still a standards war going on in the wireless power sector, it's all over bar the shouting and it wouldn't have added that much to the cost or thickness of the phone. Google also gets brownie points for including a plethora of USB cables in the box. Switching to the new omnidirectional USB plug makes all your old chargers redundant, and getting reliable replacements can be tricky, or even dangerous. So the Pixel ships with the standard Type C charger, but also a Type A to Type C cable running USB 3.0 and a Type C to Type C cable. There's also a Type C to Type C converter. It's a very generous package and one that would have been very useful if the Nexus 5X and 6P had had similar support. Software snippets Google has made a big deal about how the Pixel is the first phone with its software Assistant built in. Activating the Assistant is easy enough – simply say "OK Google" or hold the Home button and then ask a question like "what's the weather like today?" and it'll do its best to answer you. Think of it like a slightly enhanced version of the standard Google search. It's not a bad bit of code, but it's hardly a massive selling point. Siri is slightly dumber, but not by much, and standard searching can do nearly as good a job. It also needs the phone to have full access privileges for your account and if you don't want to overshare with the Chocolate Factory, then it won't work. A much better piece of software for the phone is Duo, Google's videoconferencing app. The cutest feature of this code is that when someone calls you on Duo you get to see video of them before deciding whether to pick up the call, which is very handy. Android's latest skin looks rather spiffy The big worry before getting the phone was the Android 7.1 operating system. On Nexus handsets this was as barebones as you could get, but Google said that with the Pixel it will add its own touches. As it turns out, the skin is very good and takes away nothing from the phone. By the end of a week's use I actually preferred it to the Nexus interface. The verdict As a dedicated Nexus user for many years, the Pixel was a phone to look forward to. But it does have one major drawback. From a hardware perspective the phone is top-of-the-line, with specifications that match anything else on the market at the moment. The camera – particularly its image stabilization and low-light features – is excellent, and the whole unit feels solid and workmanlike. On the software side, getting unlimited photo storage is a great feature (but watch out for telco data charges) and Assistant is nice, if somewhat oversold. The new Android build is excellent and since this phone comes from Google, users will be first in line for OS upgrades and the regular monthly security patches, which is a major selling point for those who pay attention to looking after their data. But the biggest turn-off on the device is the price. Google is the same price as Apple for its iPhone 7 Plus and doesn't have the looks of Cook & Co's top-range handsets – although nor does it use proprietary connectors. You can understand Google's pricing policy – it wants to start reaping the same profits as Apple for its smartphones. But the high price is going to make its core Nexus base abandon the phone at just the time when Chinese manufacturers are offering similar handsets to the Pixel for a much lower cost. It may be that Google can build a smartphone brand that's just as desirable as the iPhone and attracts similar hordes of devoted fans willing to pay the Mountain View equivalent of the Cupertino idiot tax.

By Gary Jones / Published 6th November 2016 SAMSUNG The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge's newest features come straight from the Note 7 After months of turmoil Samsung has finally decided to pull the plug on its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, although it appears one piece of it will live on. The Korean tech giant announced in October that the device would be removed from sale immediately and production stopped. In a statement Samsung said: "We recently readjusted the production volume for thorough investigation and quality control, but putting consumer safety as top priority, we have reached a final decision to halt production of Galaxy Note 7s," However, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is now being refreshed with popular features pinched straight from the doomed Note 7. A new colour – dubbed Blue Coral – is being rolled out by the South Korean firm and is borrowed directly from the now-discontinued smartphone. Pixel camera review - view our images shot on Google's smartphone Saturday, 29th October 2016 THE Pixel camera promises to be the best on the market but is at good as Google thinks it is? 1 / 15 DAILY STAR ONLINE Google Pixel camera review Samsung explains: "The new Blue Coral edition follows this year’s colour trends, which are less vivid and more tranquil. "Inspired by nature, the colour shimmers as if it is illuminated from the inside of the phone’s glass surface. "In particular, Samsung applied a contrasting gold tone hue to the phone’s metallic frame. "The resulting two-toned combination is at once calming and sophisticated." Samsung have also been busy behind the scenes, releasing a new update that brings even more features from the Note 7 to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and regular S7 smartphone.

It will also allow for notifications to be shown - a feature that has yet to be seen on the first for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge range. In a statement, Samsung confirmed: "We have issued a software update delivering certain feature enhancements to the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which offer a more convenient and customisable mobile experience." The news comes after Samsung recalled the original Note 7 after a number of devices caught fire. Samsung thought they'd fixed the problem but fresh reports of so called "fixed" phones, also exploding has left the firm with no option but to bin the device permanently.

Either for selling or so that users can access your website more easily. This would be of great help for maintaining your visitors loyal. Now think a bit, accessing a website from a phone implies unlocking your phone, accessing your browser, searching on Google for the keywords. Or accessing your bookmarks from withing the browser. Now think a bit, accessing a website from a phone implies unlocking your phone, accessing your browser, searching on Google for the keywords. Or accessing your bookmarks from withing the browser. But wouldn’t it be lovely that once you unlock your phone, right in front of you on the screen there is a nice looking icon that once pressed will open the website you’re trying to access? There are few to none websites that I know about that offer this functionality. If you ever heard of Pat Flynn from Smart Passive Income, he’s the only one that have’s an app for his podcasts and blog posts and I find his app very useful. Really! Sharing this already made me feel like I should’ve kept that to myself. If it came to me it means that others are thinking about it also. Think and act! The next thing that may happen is to see that every website haves such an app to offer on the front page.   How Much Does it Cost to Create an App? [INFOGRAPHIC] Are you considering building a mobile app? Surely, the mobile industry is growing leaps and bounds. In fact, it is projected to turn into a $77-billion-dollar industry in 2017. Before going into the cost, ask yourself first, “Do I actually need a mobile app?” Just because everyone is creating one, doesn’t mean you should have one too! If your answer is yes, know the different factors in mobile app development. There are many variable questions that you should answer. Andrew Gazdecki, CEO at Bizness Apps, has outlined what you need to know to create a mobile app in this infographic below. See more…     You can outsource an app like this sooo sooo easy! Acces FreeLancer, Fiverr or Upwork right now and you will find thousands of talented developers ready to do it for you in exchange for $50 or less! Forget the 50 dollars, think about the value you are getting back from it.   Mobile Internet Usage Surpasses Desktop for First Time Ever Worldwide A press release issued this morning from StatCounter reveals mobile and tablet internet usage has exceeded desktop for the first time ever. In October 2016, mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of internet usage compared to 48.7% by desktop. This marks the first time worldwide mobile internet usage has eclipsed desktop. There’s no telling if this trend will continue, but mobile web usage has historically grown during the holiday season. Aodhan Cullen, CEO of StatCounter, echoes what SEOs and marketers have been saying for years now — mobile needs to be a priority for more businesses: “This should be a wake up call especially for small businesses, sole traders and professionals to make sure that their websites are mobile friendly. Many older websites are not.” Looking at various parts of the world on their own, statistics show more mature markets, such as US and UK, still use desktop computers as their primary mode of using the internet. Then there are markets like India, for example, where mobile devices account for 75% of all internet usage. Read more…   Looking at the statistics my proposal is more than just an idea. And let’s say that the phone users will never outclass desktop user and if they will, it will drop again just like it happened in October. This idea could still boost your website traffic by 25% (more or less). Would you say “No thanks” to that percentage? I don’t think so. Even 15% even 10% EVEN 5 % that’s still a lot depending on your traffic.

Try out these 5 tricks to get better search results on Google. By: Sneha Saha Published: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 14:00 [IST] To get any information about anything is easy. Just type the keywords on the Google Search engine and you are done. Rather you might just get information that is far more than what you would actually need. However, getting more information than you require is also a little annoying. Searching for the accurate information among the numerous links that Google provides you with is surely a tough task. SEE ALSO: 5 Scams That Every WhatsApp User Should Be Aware Of We at GizBot have come up with a list of effective methods to try out to search the most accurate information on Google in just a few clicks. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Searching Using Synonyms of the Keyword To get better search results, use synonyms of the keyword you are searching for as it is a good option. All you need to type on the search engine is put the keyword you are searching information for, enter "~" symbol and type the synonym. Example: type Healthy~Food, and you'll get information about principles of healthy eating, cooking recipes, and other related stuff. Use Asterisk Sign In case you're not able to remember a word, the "*" symbol comes into play. Just use the asterisk symbol in the place of the word you are unable to remember, and click on the search option, Google will show the related result that you were looking for. Enter Either This or That Sometimes its happens that we often forget whether we are typing the correct keyword on the Google search engine. All that you can do is, enter option and put "or" and enter the option that you are confused with. Google will display the most appropriate result. Searching for a Title or URL In case one needs to find the keywords and name of an article, all that the user can do is just type "intitle:" before the term that you want to search for. Whereas, to find a URL enter "inurl:". Use a Time Frame Sometimes we forget when an event occurred. In such a situation, you can simply add a time frame to your search query with the help of three dots between the dates such as 1900...2000.

Are they the two consequences of the same cathartic loss of Oct 13? Yes, definitely. In light there's also darkness, in grief there's also hatred, and in this strange period of limbo the grip is being tightened. Nine hundred web addresses carrying blasphemous content have been blocked by the government in the past month, 200 by the mothership of Section 44 and 700 by regular court orders. Twenty-five people have been charged with lese majeste in the same period. The army, taking time off from helping farmers harvesting rice, set up a new Cyber Centre on Tuesday to patrol the online universe -- the only battlefield onto which they'll get their boots dirtied these days -- in a bid to beef up our defences against hackers as well as to monitor lese majeste offences. This is a fight on a global scale, an information war waged by a slow, bureaucratic government against the torrents of data, shadow sites, dark webs, proxy servers, encrypted dialogue, hooded hackers and infinite streams of bits and bytes generated by invisible malcontents. The executives of Facebook, Line and Google have been contacted by our high-ranking officials who asked them to monitor and remove content deemed to violate Thai laws. This is not the first time such a request -- it will forever remain a request, not a fatwa someone wishes it to be -- has been made, and as in every case the tech firms respond politely that while they realise the sensitivity of our historic times, they will look into the matter. But we're asking for more. We are enlisting some of the world's biggest innovators in our daydreaming scheme of mass surveillance -- or a mass exorcism against the Satanic verses lurking in the dark. We've asked them to help purge the sins of our apostates even though Google, Facebook and Line practise a different religion: we medieval creatures still believe in a "universe" -- "uni", the one and only -- while the world has moved on to the multiverse where conflicting streams of thoughts, however ugly, or ideological rebellion, however unsound, are frowned upon but hardly a crime. Line in fact denied our request flatly: "We do not monitor or block user content." Google and Facebook agreed to take "appropriate action", a vague statement far from a commitment. We're also asking western countries to extradite lese majeste "fugitives". And no matter how I find some of those anti-establishment's protest tactics dumb and tasteless -- the ideological pornography of Aum Neko for instance -- I wish that Thai authorities stop pretending that their requests would amount to anything. Again, we all know those countries practise a different religion, not a superior or an inferior one, only different, and what is a sin here is not a sin everywhere. Their Judgement Day hasn't yet arrived while we're expediting ours. Google and Facebook won't treat our case as more pressing than, say, a request from Malaysia or Pakistan to weed out online agitators. We're not the universe -- we're just one in an endless stream of cyber-verses. So what we have left now is the new Army Cyber Centre. Operating on tax money, they will stalk and catch violators of the dreaded Section 112, possibly by having hundreds of soldiers hunch over their screens 24/7 like in a sci-fi movie, only that it's less about science and usually more about fiction. And it's also left to the volunteers and "rubbish collector" squad to make the rounds on Facebook hoping to pounce on the malefactors, the provocateurs, the non-believers in our great system. On the surface is a technological battle -- how many proxy servers can you hop if we keep blocking them -- but essentially it is a spiritual one: it's the devout against the infidels. The authorities shouldn't let their insecurity show: they should know that in this country, in this "Thai universe", the "progressive", the "left", the "revolutionary", the "young", the "liberal", whatever the term, will never win, not soon or ever. The entrenched tradition, the comfort of conservatism, the decades of middle-class conditioning -- all of this has ensured that the conformist, the military, the establishment, will always prevail, with or without the help of Google, Facebook and Line. To go around pleading with the rest of the world to believe what we believe is unbecoming, and unnecessary. Hunting down the Antichrists only shows the weakness of your faith -- that it's fallible, destructible, when it's not (is it?). The multiverse contains variation, some worthy, others not, but it has laid out a new ground zero where nothing is unique or unarguable. It's time to keep calm and learn to live with that.

It marches on and on and slowly, gradually but assuredly, sweeps aside everything that is old. The smartphones, in every measure marvels of technology, are doing it since 2007. And finally in 2016, they have reached a position where they are threatening even the mighty DSLR cameras when it comes to clicking photos. At least, the high-end phones like the Google Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are doing that. No, the phones are still not better than a proper DSLR or a large sensor camera. But the likes of the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are so good that for many people, they will be good enough. And in most cases, these high-end expensive phones are definitely better than many cheap compact cameras, even in low and tricky light. Also Read: Pixel XL quick review: Google's love letter to Android fans So, just what is going on? Two things. One, the image sensors and lenses etc have become good in the phones. And two, which is actually the bigger deal, the phone companies are winning it on the basis of their software and all that computing horsepower they are putting in the phones using powerful processors. This refined software and computing power allows phones to process the images in a way that ensures that even if technically, at pixel level, these images aren't as good as the dedicated cameras, they are good enough -- in some cases even better -- compared to images clicked with high-end cameras. Don't believe us? Just take a look at these five comparison shots (the two you can see on the page, for the other three click the links). Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera. Occasionally These images have been shot with Canon 5D Mark IV, the latest and greatest Canon DSLR camera, the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL. For some observations on these images, scroll past the photos. Other 3 images: Link 1 | Link 2 | Link 3 Some observations One reason why the Pixel XL and and the iPhone 7 Plus look so good in these images is because of the small size. In full-resolution, a DSLR image will look better. Although image quality of the camera in newer phones is fantastic, they are still too slow for razor sharp images of pets or anything or anyone moving. They are slow to focus and slow to click and process images. You can shoot wildlife with a phone camera, unless you are clicking photos of a lumbering elephant or a sleeping hippo. And yes, the pet cat doesn't count in wildlife. For absolute best quality, you can't beat the DSLR, although it does require a lot of effort to create amazing pictures with a big and bulky camera. The convenience of a phone camera is unmatched. Click, apply and filter and share on Instagram. For anyone not shooting for pure pleasure or profession, a phone camera is so much more fun. Nowadays with phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL being so good, you buy a DSLR camera for its flexibility, its lens options, its ability to be a specialised tool -- a portrait camera or a machine that can freeze a sprinting cheetah in a frame. For everyday, regular photos, a high-end phone can click amazing photos and is more fun to use.

It runs Nougat and packs in quality optics. Then, there's the Moto Z, a modular smartphone that trans forms into a point-and-shoot. And finally , the Honor 8, a smartphone that comes with dual rear snappers. All three devices are equipped with top-end chips, high-res scratch-resistant screens, day-long battery life and the USB Type-C interface for fast charging and OTG pen drive support.Read on to find out which one is for you... HONOR 8 Build: The Honor 8 is the new device from Huawei's spinoff brand that builds smartphones for online sales. In keeping with its flagship status, it is fabricated out of aluminium alloy , which is then encased under multiple layers of glass to give it a shimmery look. Its screen is fronted by toughened Gorilla Glass that's scratch resistant and protects against accidental nicks and bumps. The Full HD display renders crisp text and punchy colours with deep blacks and excellent contrast. You also get the option to tweak the colour profile according to your viewing preferences, as well as a reading mode that filters out blue light to reduce eye strain. Overall, the Honor 8 looks plush and feels solid, but with so much glass in its fabrication, we would be extremely nervous if it slipped or fell. User Interface: The handset's customised user interface comes packed with a lot of accessibility settings for improved handling. For instance, you can enable a floating dock that lets you navigate the screen without reaching for the touch controls at the bottom; you can clear background tasks and even lock the display with a tap. Its fingerprint sensor, which also responds as a clickable button, can be used to unlock the handset, answer a call, silence the alarm, and recognise gestures for direct access to the Honor 8's notification panel and photo gallery. You can also assign this "smart key" to launch an app or utility, take a screenshot, etc with a few quick presses. The Honor 8 is equipped with motion recognition that allows you to mute an incoming call by flipping the device over, answer a call by raising the phone to the ear, and more. Plus, you get an infrared port and a companion app to control your television, cable TV box and Bluray player from the handset itself. Performance: The Honor 8 works without any hiccups despite the heavy customisation over the Android Marshmallow OS. In fact, its processor is almost on a par - in terms of synthetic benchmarks - with the chips on the Moto Z and Google Pixel. This means, it runs highdefinition content and intensive 3D games very smoothly . Call quality and network handling is easily one of the best in smartphones, and audio playback with earphones sounds balanced, complete with low bass lines, crisp mid ranges and pronounced highs. On the downside, the music player doesn't include any presets or a graphic equalizer to fine-tune the output.Cameras: The dual rear cameras - one is equipped with a monochrome sensor for detail while the other captures colour - on this handset are quick to focus and take photos that are sharp, and rendered with neutral colours and contain a considerable amount of detail. A depth of field effect lets you decide on the subject you want to focus on even after taking a snapshot. That said, this software optimisation is not perfect, but works well in most cases to give you snapshots that are comparable to those you would shoot on a point and shoot camera. Pictures taken in low light are impressive, retaining detail with minimal image softening.Results can be further improved with the Honor 8's manual mode. You even get presets for scanning documents, photographing food, capturing light trails, shooting slow motion clips, and more.The front snapper takes selfies with neutral colours and slightly muted skin tone, which are still pretty good for sharing online. Battery: Despite its bright, high-res display and processing muscle, the Honor 8 manages to provide well over a day's worth of battery with mixed usage. Plus, you get three power management modes and the ability to lower the screen resolution to save juice. As far as flagship devices go, the Honor 8 ticks all the right boxes. If you're looking for a premium handset that sports eye-catching design, promises consistent top-of-theline performance, great set of cameras (with customisation modes) and battery life, this is worth your consideration. MOTO Z Build: The Moto Z's biggest differentiator is its modular design. Depending on your need, you can opt for a camera mod with 10x optical zoom, a dual 3-watt speaker mod, a 50-lumens projector mod, and a 2220mAh battery attachment (all sold separately).These add-ons snap onto the device magnetically and connect to it via 16 gold contacts on its back. The smartphone is fabricated out of aluminium, stainless steel and toughened glass. You get a textured back cover in the box for when you use the device without its add-ons, and a hard plastic bumper case to protect the edges in case of accidental falls. Like most other Motos, the Z is treated with a water-repellent "nanocoating" to guard against accidental spills. Its Quad HD display renders bright colours, crisp text and is usable even under sunlight. The handset feels solid, but we recommend careful handling when used with its accessories - especially the camera mod - as a fall could lead to both components separating, and even damage to the add on. User Interface: For most part, you get a stock Android Marshmallow interface with subtle additions like Active Display , where sensors detect a wave of your hand to display the date, time and notifications. You can also twist your wrist twice to activate the camera, or shake the handset to activate its rear flash for torch like illumination. A fingerprint sensor adds a layer of security to your device. All in all, the lack of bloatware makes the handset responsive and spiffy . Performance: The Moto Z pairs with the mods seamlessly. Also, you don't need to turn the device off before attaching the mods. The handset posted high scores in synthetic benchmarks, and this processing muscle is reflected in day-to-day use. It handles Full HD movies, as well as 3D games like Modern Combat 5 and War Robots without a problem. Notably , the Moto Z lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, you will have to use a wireless headset, or invest in a pair of USB Type-C earphones, or use the included converter to use the Moto Z's standard hands-free kit. Considering this is a top-end phone, the included earphones are underwhelming performers with muted highs and dull lows. Calls are clear, crisp, and the Moto Z's handling of networks is comparable to some of the best smartphones that exist. Camera: The rear shooter captures quality stills in well-lit environments. It uses a laser to focus on subjects quickly and the results appear evenly lit with adequate detail and sharpness. Grain begins to appear in photos - and there is also some softening of details - as soon as there is a drop in lighting. Shooting pictures in HDR poses quite another problem: There is a noticeable lag after you press the shutter release button, and moving subjects end up looking blurry because the camera takes a split second to process the shot. The front shooter is quite average; skin tones look pale and washed out. Here, the strong front-facing flash adds some warmth to the frame. Snap on the Hasselblad True Zoom mod (`19,999) and the phone becomes a full-fledged camera - with a 12MP sensor, flash and 10x optical zoom. Photo captures, without magnification, are mostly on a par with the Z's stock camera, except that it achieves better depth of field. Use the zoom lens, and framing a shot requires steady hands. Even though the mod includes optical image stabilisation, shooting at fullzoom results in shots with mixed results. For instance, we managed to take some very good shots of birds under a canopy of leaves, which is not usually possible with a smartphone, but only after a few frustrating tries. Battery: The True Zoom mod draws power from the phone's battery , so long sessions with it will dent the Moto Z's battery life to much less than a day . Thankfully, the JBL SoundBoost Speaker (`6,999) and the Moto Insta-Share Projector (`19,999) mods - which were not available to us for tests - include a 1000mAh and 1100mAh battery , respectively. By itself, you can expect to get a day's worth of work done with a single charge of the Moto Z's battery . Add the battery mod (`5,999), and you can expect almost two days. The Moto Z's modular design will require some tweaking before it becomes truly viable. At present, it is an expensive proposition with each mod costing almost as much as an entire smartphone.Buy if you are an `early adopter' of tech and want bragging rights to owning a phone that can shape shift into a camera, speaker and projector. GOOGLE PIXEL Build: Google's flagship smartphone keeps things simple with a smooth anodised aluminium body and a dual-tone finish on the back panel. You get a bright Quad HD oleophobic toughened display that's responsive and works wonderfully when in the bright outdoors. Colours appear vibrant with excellent contrast. The Pixel will not win any awards for original design, but you will find no reason to complain about its build, which feels solid and well balanced in the hand. Still, for its asking price, we would have preferred if it came with some form of water resistance. User Interface: The Pixel comes with the latest version of Android, called `Nougat'. There's Google Assistant, a personal voice-activated helper, which is an augmented version of Google Now, where you can expect to get some amusing answers for cheeky questions like "What do you like to eat?", " Are you married?".The Assistant was able to understand myriad thick accents we used and it did a fair job of finding answers too. That said, it is unable to extract info locally from the phone as easily as it reveals web results for nearby restaurants and world trivia. You can now preview notifications and perform basic actions (archive an email, reply to an SMS) without unlocking the screen. The notification panel is also redesigned to make it easier to access quick settings, which can be reorganized to your preferences.Visually , icons and text look smaller and crisper. However, Nougat lets you adjust their size as well. Pressing and holding an app icon now displays a contextual menu with quick-action options for that app. For instance, press and hold the Contacts icon to quickly add a new contact; do the same with the Gmail icon to choose Compose, and the Camera icon to choose between "Take a video" or "Take a selfie". With Nougat, you get native support for faster switching between apps: Double tap the Recents button (extreme right control in the navigation panel) to switch between two recently-used apps. This is equivalent to the Alt+Tab shortcut on a Windows machine. And if you long press this control, it enables a multi-window mode. However, this works only with supported apps, which as of now is restricted to Google services like Gmail, Chrome, Maps, etc. You also get unlimited online storage for photos and videos at their original resolution - so you don't have to worry about running out of memory . Performance: The Google Pixel notched the highest scores in synthetic benchmarks, thanks to the currentgen processor purring under the hood. The handset worked fluidly; switching quickly between apps, working across two apps in split-screen mode without freezing up, and playing stutter-free HD games. Simply put, this is one of the most powerful smartphones in the market right now. Camera: Ever since the Pixel's launch, everyone has been talking about its cameras. Well, it's true: this handset is equipped with the best set of smartphone cameras. Portraits taken with the rear camera are sharp with lots of detail and vibrant colours. Low light shots are also impressive; noise is kept under control with little loss of detail. Here, the Pixel uses electronic image stabilisation (EIS) and shots tend to take on a slight yellow tinge. Selfies taken with the front camera are much better than what the Honor 8 and Moto Z were able to manage. There was just the right amount of exposure and warm skin tones. So if you want a good Android handset primarily for a good camera, put your money on the Pixel. Battery: Now with all its processing muscle and sterling hardware, the Pixel XL still manages to eke out almost two days of service before requiring a recharge. This can vary if the device is used for watching movies and mobile photography . The Google Pixel comes at a premium price tag, but it comes with one of the best cameras, the absolute current and fastest mobile processor, and runs the latest version of Android. You also get a Type-C-to-USB cable to connect pen drives for direct file transfers. If budget is not a constraint, get this phone for its hardware, display, battery life and fantastic cameras. It's an all-round winner alright.

However, it comes with a few caveats. By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 13:40 [IST] One of the most painful things about switching to a new smartphone is setting it up. Thankfully, if you're one of those who is switching from an Apple iPhone to the recently launched Google Pixel/Pixel XL the process just got a lot easier. Google is bundling the smartphone with a small USB Type-C to Type-A adapter and calls it Quick Switch Adapter. Using this you can transfer data from the iPhone to Pixel flawlessly. All you have to do is connect both the smartphones to the dongle and a Software Wizard will take you through the entire process. SEE ALSO: 5 Scams That Every WhatsApp User Should Be Aware Of However, this process does come with a few caveats. In this article, we will list the step-by-step procedure to transfer data from your old smartphone and then later discuss the limitations. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Connect Apple iPhone and Google Pixel to the Quick Switch adapter To begin with, you have to connect both the Apple iPhone and the Google Pixel to the bundled Quick Switch adapter. Give Pixel the access to your iPhone Once you've connected both the smartphones to the dongle, a pop-up will show up on your iPhone asking if it should "Trust" the Google Pixel. Click on the Trust button, as soon as you do it, the Pixel smartphone will be given access to all the data it can copy from the iPhone. Choose the data you intend to transfer As soon as Google is done with searching your iPhone for copyable data, choose the content you intend to transfer from the options displayed on your Pixel's screen. Some of the options include Calendar, Contacts, Email, Message attachments, iMessages, Music, Photos, and Videos among others. That's it you're done with transferring data from your old smartphone to the new Google Pixel/ Pixel XL. Eligibility Criteria This process is same for both Pixel and Pixel XL and works with all the iPhones which run on iOS 8 and above. It also works with other Android smartphones if the handset runs Android 5.0 Lollipop or above. Caveats Let's start with the Calendar app, despite the fact that Google can move all the data such as calendar appointments from iPhone to Google Calendar app, it can't stay synced with your iCloud calendar. Which means if you share your iCloud calendar with another iCloud user, any changes made here will not be reflected on the Google Calendar app. Similarly, all your iMessage conversations will be transferred to the Messages app on your Pixel/Pixel XL, however, if you reply to those messages you'll be charged with standard SMS rates. Also, according to Pocket-lint, some music tracks may also be not copied from the iPhone owing to the copyright issues.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google moves to revamp Play Store to help developers Google moves to revamp Play Store to help developers Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses with a Play Store revamp. By: Reuters | Published:November 5, 2016 1:42 pm Google is revamping the Play Store to help out app developers. Alphabet Inc’s Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation. Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google’s efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google’s Chromebook laptops.  “What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,” said Samat. ANDROID WILD WEST Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. “The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,” he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system – but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple’s App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. Also read: Google Play’s new feature will queue downloads for WiFi: Report A big part of Google’s new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google’s Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. “The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people’s time and attention,” he said.

Mozilla and Google have pulled the extension from their stores after a report aired on German national television that the company was selling the browsing history of its users. The browser extension, designed to inform users about security or privacy issues on sites they visit, is currently not available for download. Users who try to open the add-on site on Mozilla's Firefox add-ons site get a "we're sorry, but we can't find what you're looking for" error message currently. Google's Chrome Web Store merely states that "the requested URL was not found on this server". Information is scarce at this point as both Mozilla and Google have not openly released information about the removal. The German newspaper FAZ managed to get a statement from Mozilla about the removal. According to the statement, Web of Trust was pulled because it violated add-on guidelines, and specifically transparency in regards to the add-on's collection of user data. According to Web of Trust, which Faz got a statement from as well, this was caused by the company's latest privacy policy published on the company website not being made available on the Firefox add-on site. If you check out the privacy policy on the Web of Trust website, you will notice that it collects the following information: IP address, geographic location, type of device, operating system and browser, date and time, browsing usage including visited web pages, clickstream date or web address accessed, browser identifier and user ID. Users who have Web of Trust installed in the browser won't be affected by the pulling of the add-on. According to research posted on Bugzilla@Mozilla, the tracking that is been discussed in German media has been added to the extension back in 2015. So what is going to happen now? The most likely cause of action is the following one. Web of Trust updates the privacy policy on the store pages of the add-on to better highlight the data collecting of the add-on. Mozilla and Google will then re-enable the extension on their Stores so that users can download and install it again. It is unclear right now whether WOT is asked to modify code of its extension in regards to user tracking, or if the simple highlighting of the fact that the add-on collects user data is enough for restoration. Now You: What's your take on the whole situation? Summary Article Name Mozilla and Google remove WOT extension from Store Description The popular browser extension Web of Trust is no longer available on the Firefox add-on repository or the Google Chrome Web Store.

They should have their code audited (as every extension should) to be validated.. this safe until proven otherwise clearly doesn't work. Reply khidreal November 5, 2016 at 10:17 am # WOT is totally an extension I will avoid. where's the good old Opensource/free software (including extensions) made to just help people that live through donations? people that make something, waste their time to help others, waste their money, and don't ask for nothing. that's people that I would support every month if I had some extra money, that's people that we should care about, developers that make something in exchange of nothing. for me, devs like the ones behind WOT that collect everything a user does online are scam. I will totaly avoid WOT. Reply Paranam Kid November 5, 2016 at 10:31 am # I am always concerned by privacy violations, as is the case here. Nevertheless, the info WOT supplies about websites' trustworthiness is ver important. I don't know any other extension that supplies this kind of info without raping you at the same time. And I consider security more important than privacy, so will not uninstall WOT. I did implement the uBlockO filtering that Tom Howach mentioned on this site yesterday. Reply Helpful November 5, 2016 at 10:46 am # Bitdefender Trafficlight Reply Parker Lewis November 5, 2016 at 12:54 pm # These rules only have a chance to work if the WoT leaks are filtered by the lists you use with uBO. That also assumes that these leaks can be separated by rules from legitimate WoT traffic needed for the extension to work. (I never used WoT but I don't think they can.) I wouldn't consider myself protected unless I verified this first hand. An alternative is to only use the website WoT, not the add-on, so in practise it would only be for sites you have a reason to doubt. You could use a bookmark keyword "wot ghacks.net" or add a WoT search engine or something to make the website check as quick as possible. Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 2:58 pm # "An alternative is to only use the website WoT, not the add-on, so in practise it would only be for sites you have a reason to doubt." I agree. I've set a bookmarklet to get WOT information about a site, including users' reviews, which I run when, as you write, I have a doubt : javascript:void(open('https://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/'+location.hostname)) David November 5, 2016 at 10:41 am # More evidence that add-on signing is worthless Reply Fx0 November 5, 2016 at 2:49 pm # It has NOTHING to do with add-on signing, so what do you want to say? Reply Yelan November 6, 2016 at 2:02 pm # David is trying to say that add-on signing does absolutely NOTHING to keep potentially dangerous extensions from being installed, because it only controls who is allowed to distribute extensions, and doesn't do anything about lack of integrity of the add-ons themselves. So it has EVERYTHING to do with add-on signing (which is supposed to keep the "bad ones" out, by definition). redblue November 5, 2016 at 11:49 am # One of the worst privacy violations of the 21st century, I hope the addon never returns in any form. Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 11:51 am # I've never used WOT not because I feared privacy issues but because I disliked the very concept, that of people interfering in the fame or shame of a Web site, too subjective and at worst too much of a temptation to praise or condemn on the ground of personal feelings. Now that privacy issues seem to be factual is of course a +minus. On the other hand, if questionable behaviors need to be questioned and negative answers followed by sanctions, we all know that the planetary hysteria loves to hate as it loves to love, that it loves to feel and express emotions rather than objectivity. WOT's crucifixion will undoubtedly be acclaimed by many of which some as always with the "hang 'em up and high" state of mind (or whatever was the wording in that Wild West). I'll just keep on avoiding WOT should it re-appear. Reply Paranam Kid November 5, 2016 at 12:29 pm # The idea of having many people voting on the trustworthiness of a site is that the chance of undue negative or positive bias is minimised. I don't believe that a good site can be sunk by a bandwagon effect of negative votes, nor that a bad site can be turned positive by a bandwagon effect. I don't know of any other extension that gives similar a visual warning or approval of sites; I do rely heavily on that from WOT. Reply Jop November 5, 2016 at 1:18 pm # I've seen okay sites being marked as super dangerous and virus-giving download sites being marked as completely trustworthy. That's when I uninstalled WOT. All Things Firefox November 5, 2016 at 4:50 pm # Look at the rating for Conservapedia. https://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/conservapedia.com Whether you agree with their politics or not, the site definitely does not serve up malware. However, it is rated at 32 and all the comments on why the reviewers don't trust it are political. I've noticed that sites are sometimes punished for political views and nothing more. ams November 5, 2016 at 7:43 pm # "I don't believe that a good site can be sunk by a bandwagon effect of negative votes" Yes, it really can. Further, and not specific to WOT, a market has sprung up for "buying likes, buying favorable mentions, buying positive reviews, etc." and employing such has been an increasingly common tactic of advertising campaigns; part of the "ad spend" is budgeted toward paying brokers to have AmazonTurk -like worker bees post favorable mentions, favorable reviews. ams November 5, 2016 at 7:44 pm # "I don't believe that a good site can be sunk by a bandwagon effect of negative votes" Yes, it really can.

It must be very saddening for them to watch this happen to their brainchild. Reply pd November 5, 2016 at 2:58 pm # WoUntrustable should be obliterated from the net. But they are not the problem. The problem the pathetic lack of a decent permissions model where add-ons are concerned, let alone the web overall. Compared to the mobile phone app ecosystems, the web is sorely lacking in this regard. As a huge supporter of the open web, this is greatly distressing to me. The vast majority of people DO NOT READ privacy policies. To suggest that users be expected to do so is ludicrous. Users are not all lawyers! The best way to ensure users are conscious of the choices they're making and privacy they're relinquishing when installing an add-on, is to create the sort of framework of per-activity/function permission system Android 6 and the like currently implement. I'm sure it's not perfect but compared to the web's invisible privacy / permissions framework, the mobile phone system is like a rolls royce compared to a trabant. Reply wonton November 5, 2016 at 5:10 pm # wot for firefox had a remote code execution vulnerability where wot or another addon could use wot to execute any code with system level privileges this was one determine factor that got wot removed. the researcher could not see any cases where this was abused but who know what wot did they changed owners without telling anyone then the code to collect data was added. this seems to be a popular trend where addons a selling out with large user bases then updates land doing very questionable things. Reply ams November 5, 2016 at 7:56 pm # When did WOT change ownership? Who currently owns it? I wasn't aware of the change & AFAIK was never notified via email regarding my user account at the mywot site. "this seems to be a popular trend where addons a selling out with large user bases then updates land doing very questionable things" I AGREE! It is an alarming trend Reply Dan82 November 5, 2016 at 7:58 pm # Let them post a new privacy policy and/or terms of service and allow them to be listed again, only for people to ignore those pieces of text anyway? I think, for the credibility of their web-stores, both Google and Mozilla should either ban the piece of software entirely now and in the future, or if they don't, then at the very least they need to create an extension rating/categorization system that can tell even the average end-user if his or her privacy will be compromised by using this or that extension. Doubt that'll happen though, because both companies (the former without a doubt but in some ways also the latter) are interested in making money from user data. Reply DwightStegall November 5, 2016 at 9:02 pm # I'm really pissed off about this. I don't care if they're selling my history. It's a small price to pay for safety on the web. Now I'm such with crappy Mcafee Site Advisor. Almost all software gathers users data. No one says anything about that. :( Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 9:28 pm # There are means to be safe -- or at least as safe as with WOT -- without the cost of one's data. I cannot and will never get undressed for either a service or a protection : neither prostitution nor an accepted racket. That's the tend, that's how many companies wish the scenario to be and to be understood as such. Of course some of us don't care and get undressed free, some do care and get a service/protection for getting undressed, and some do care even more and get a service/protection without getting undressed. There's always a price, but my privacy is worth more than what is offered. My privacy is priceless. Business is planetary now, especially with the Internet. Broader the audience wider the number of those who accept to exchange their privacy for a service/protection, and that should be far enough to keep the business machine rolling, hence allow those who refuse to keep on getting many things free : it's called a population's disparity. If business cannot deal with that then it'll be what it is already : a combat. Reply Dwight Stegall November 6, 2016 at 7:28 am # Probably half of the free software does that. Why are they singling out WOT? Undressed? Prostitution? What drug are you on? :( Tom Hawack November 6, 2016 at 11:26 am # WOT is not a victim of persecution but happens to have been caught. WOT is not the only only, other sites have similar practices among which some haven't been caught. OK. Yet, this attitude "All or so many do it than what the heck? Why not take the good and accept the bad?" seems to me a cynical, hence a defeatist attitude, a trending one especially amid the younger generation. Honesty, integrity together with talent and skill exist everywhere in life, on the Internet as well. You have to make the effort to find them and of course no motivation for effort if cynicism leads one's thoughts or if cynicism is the pretext of laziness. Your "Probably half the sites does that" is meaningless and can be easily toggled to "half the sites doesn't do that". Being concerned by security without having to pay the price of our privacy aims to search for that other half. But it requires indeed efforts and not the easy way out, that of defeatism. Paddleless November 5, 2016 at 10:29 pm # I uninstalled WOT when I realized that the ratings there could not be relied on. You can check the reputation of websites at any of these: http://www.scamvoid.com http://www.scamidentifier.com http://www.urlvoid.com http://urlcheck.info/en/ Some include WOT ratings as well as other information about the site being checked. https://app.webinspector.com is another useful tool, though it takes a couple of minutes to return results.

Tom Hawack November 11, 2016 at 1:01 pm # @ Rick, I'm as well a bookmarklet fan, these are so handy; as well I have a dedicated Bookmarks Toolbar sub-folder, including some of those you mentioned together with others, of which several don't call a site but simply operate a function on the site they're called from, for instance toggling a site from http to https : javascript:((function(){window.location=location.href.replace(/^http/i,"https").replace(/^http\w{2,}/i,"http");})()); To be noted : 1- Javascript must be active, of course; also, if using an add-on such as uBlockO, per-site scripting must not be disabled. 2- Firefox Add-ons such as 'Clean Links' or 'Skip Redirect' must include in their options exceptions to handle sites called by bookmarklets... 2.1- 'Clean Links' add-on : add in its Options / Skip Domains domains included in a bookmarklet (the called domain, not the calling domain, i.e. "www.virustotal.com" if using the VirusTotal bookmarklet). 2.2- 'Skip Redirect' add-on : same as with 'Clean Links' but this time in 'Skip redirects' Options / Exceptions. I prefer 'Skip Redirect' to 'Clean Links' now, because the latter seems outdated and problematic here... One last bookmarklet "pour la route" as we say in French (no idea how to translate that, means something like "in case of, to be sure"), which performs a call to PrintFriendly which prints (or PDF) the page it's called from in a neat way : javascript:void(open('http://www.printfriendly.com/print/?url='+location.href)) Bookmarklets are a great tool applicable in many situations and concerning many topics. When it appears to be tough to make our own searching the Web sometimes brings the answer, i.e. the bookmarklet for VirusTotal which I would have been unable to determine myself. To end with the artist's feeling : 'bookmarklet' sounds so nice :) Rick November 14, 2016 at 2:23 am # @Tom Hawack - i've tried that https bookmarklet and it works and does what it's supposed to do, i like it and i've bookmarked that one as well, thanks. i have noticed on some sites it doesn't work as well as https everywhere add-on, say nike.com because the URL changes more than just an "s", like "http://store.nike.com/us/en/" to "https://secure-store.nike.com/us/en_us/" but i don't even recommend https everywhere on nike.com anyway unless maybe your in checkout because it will cause trouble while viewing items/changing colors/changing sizes, it's been a goofy site anyway since they redone it years ago, the site has been finicky with Firefox at times while trying to check out and complete purchases even in safe mode, i had to complete the purchase in google chrome on Windows XP but that was the first other browser i tried, and Firefox is the only browser i will install on my windows 7/10 laptops, so i will try Edge next time if i have the same issue. That print friendly bookmarklet i bookmarked as well, i'm not sure yet what the advantages are if any as i've not tried it yet but it's interesting non the less. i haven't tried that "Skip Redirect" add-on yet either but have bookmarked that in my Firefox folder with the other add-ons i use and will give it a try and look at it's settings, i don't think i'll be able to make my own, i don't know if "Clean Links" you can make your own either but i tried. When doing some research i found "Redirector" - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/ in a posting which i didn't bookmark but it was someone wanting to default to YouTube gaming for certain videos and someone recommended the "Redirector" add-on and posted this image which i did bookmark - https://imgur.com/MA50RE1 - and it shows how to do it. i wanted to default to a clean YouTube video URL such as - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ItsgC0FNZc when i receive a video by e-mail instead of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ItsgC0FNZc&feature=em-uploademail - i could not get it to work for me. if you know of a way to get it to work or another add-on that will do it and easy to work with i would appreciate it very much even though i hate to ask as i feel i've been bothering you already in this thread, if so i'm sorry in advance, but thanks once again for all your input in this thread, it has been very useful. pHROZEN gHOST November 6, 2016 at 11:10 pm # I reported the extension as a bad one to Mozilla when not too long after it came out.

By Kedar Grandhi November 5, 2016 08:12 GMT Close Embed Feed Google UK boss Matt Brittin admits he is unaware of his own salary IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/17344" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Google Ireland has reported a 23% increase in revenues last year to €22.6bn (£20.11bn). The Dublin-based subsidiary – through which the search engine giant diverts sales from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa – revealed the same on Friday. However, the highlight of the company's financial statements was that despite such large revenues, it had paid just €46.5m in Irish corporation tax. Google Ireland said this was because its taxable profits were just €341m. It further explained that its profits were low amid an increase in its "administrative expenses". The subsidiary said that these expenses had increased by €3.5bn to €16.9bn in 2015. It attributed the increase to "increased head count", an "increase in sales and marketing effort", and "an increase in the royalties paid to a group undertaking". While the company did not provide too many details about these expenses, it said the Irish operations saw a 6% increase in total employees to 2,763 people in 2015. It said apart from these staff, it also had about 3,000 contract employees in Ireland. "As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit...In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750m," Ronan Harris, the outgoing head of its Irish operations was quoted as saying by the Irish Times. The Dublin-based firm added that total salaries paid had increased by about €365m in 2015. This indicated that Google Ireland's primary administrative expenses were made up of cash royalties paid to another Google subsidiary. While these statements did not disclose the location of the subsidiary to which the royalties were paid, according to the Guardian, all the royalties paid will eventually be directed to a business group called Google Holdings Ireland, which along with Google Ireland Limited are said to be part of the "Double Irish" arrangement. This arrangement is said to be a tax strategy used by some multinationals to lower their corporate tax liability. Being registered as an unlimited company, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. Moreover, it is not charged any corporation tax by Bermuda, the country where it is registered as a tax resident. Hence every year the company is said to save billions of dollars in taxes. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (£5.59bn) is said to have flowed in from transactions with advertisers in the UK. This declaration by Google Ireland follows former chancellor George Osborne commenting in March that he would bring in a measure aimed at closing tax loopholes. He had then said that this measure, which was called the 'google tax' or more formally the diverted profits tax, would help raise £3.1bn ($3.88bn).

Cincinnati, Ohio (PRWEB) November 05, 2016 InfoTrust is excited to announce their recent certification in Google’s Data Studio 360 platform. A reporting and data visualization tool, Google Data Studio 360 is bringing business reporting into the digital age by breaking down data silos, building auto-updating reports and creating beautiful visualizations that engage teams. Data Studio 360 is the perfect compliment to the Google Analytics 360, Google Tag Manager and Optimize 360 services already provided by InfoTrust. “A popular phrase around our office is ‘Data is the new management.’ We strongly believe that when people use data to make decisions, they are better informed and are more likely to generate favorable outcomes in all aspects of the business. That said, no one will use the data if reports are consistently out-of-date or difficult to read. That’s what we love about Data Studio 360; anyone can build reports that engage those that need to use them day-in and day-out,” says Alex Yastrebenetsky, InfoTrust CEO. In this highly technology-based era, many businesses are still exporting data offline and creating static reports. A snapshot in time, these reports take both a significant amount of time to create and do not provide those that use the reports with up-to-the-minute data with which to make business decisions. Google Data Studio 360 is determined to change this, allowing users to build reports and data visualizations that combine data from multiple sources and auto-update based on user input. About InfoTrust LLC: InfoTrust LLC is a digital analytics consulting and technology company that makes marketers happy with stress-free analytics. They combine tools for quality data collection with a powerful professional services team to help business leaders maximize results.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 5, 2016 1:18 pm Alphabet Inc’s venture capital arm CapitalG, earlier known as Google Capital, disclosed an investment in Snapchat. Alphabet Inc’s venture capital arm CapitalG, earlier known as Google Capital, disclosed an investment in Snapchat by adding the social networking firm’s logo to a page on its investment portfolio website. CapitalG has not made a formal announcement and it was not clear when Google made the investment. The company was not immediately available to comment. Snap Inc, which operates the popular messaging app Snapchat, has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering. The banks were notified last month that they had been awarded one of most coveted and potentially lucrative IPO mandates in recent years, as the Venice, California-based company vies for a $25 billion valuation in the stock market. Snapchat, which lets users send smartphone photos which automatically disappear after a few seconds, has proven popular among teenage users. The company had reportedly rejected an acquisition offer from Facebook Inc that would have valued the company at $3 billion or more in 2013. Snapchat, which first went live in 2011, has seen its daily active users cross Twitter. According to reports, the messaging app has over 150 million daily active users, which is still smaller compared to say Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram. However, that hasn’t stopped Facebook from trying to copy features of Snapchat as it seeks to boost engagement. Instagram now has Stories, which are an exact copy of the feature on Snapchat, except the photo-sharing app doesn’t yet support live filters for faces like the latter. WhatsApp beta might soon be getting a Stories-style feature in the Status Update tab, according to early testers. Interestingly Facebook is also testing live face filters on its camera app in some countries and plans to roll it out soon to the world as well. Meanwhile, Snapchat is also looking at hardware, and recently launched its first smart spectacles, which are priced at $130 and called Snap Specs. These funky sunglasses will let a user record 10-second video snippets and upload them to their Snapchat account. The camera uses a 115-degree wide angle lens, but unlike Google Glasses, these are pitched more as fun toys aimed at the younger population which is Snapchat’s core user base. Snapchat also recently introduced ads between stories as a new form of monetization for the app. With Reuters inputs © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaNo rethinking on demonetisation, 'temporary pain for larger gain': Govt after NDA meet BusinessAt least 4 months needed to replace demonetised notes, not 50 days IndiaCongress scrapped 25 paise, something of their stature, I did something of mine: PM Modi IndiaPakistan claims 7 soldiers killed at LoC; Nawaz Sharif warns India against aggression WorldBangladesh announces bounty for Hindu temple attackers EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 14: Latest News Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton tell Democrats not to despair Catholic bishops ask Donald Trump for humane immigration policies Donald Trump set to roll back President Obama’s policies on energy, environment Cash reaches ATM in remote Bastar village, over within two hours No regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

I extract items for the Wrap from my link blog, which you’re welcome to follow. To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weekly email briefing. News Look out Slack. Microsoft unleashes Teams—Microsoft has announced its Slack killer, Microsoft Teams. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it a “chat-based workspace” within Office 365, designed to bring teams together for conversation and collaboration. It also unifies Office apps like Word and Powerpoint, Skype, and other Microsoft tools in a single piece of software that work on a variety of devices. Teams also has threaded conversations, something Slack lacks. Slack has bots; so does Teams, and they’re based on Microsoft’s Bot Framework. The takeaway: By most accounts, Slack’s leaders should be very worried. Read more Need evidence that Slack is worried?—In response to Microsoft’s launch of Microsoft Teams, Slack bought a full-page ad in the New York Times that welcomed its competitor to the enterprise messaging space and offering some “friendly advice.” The takeaway: The open letter seems panicky to me and (as the TNW article points out, it seems Slack didn’t see Teams coming). Slack should also be worried about Facebook Workplace. If you think an independent company that cornered the early market is sure to maintain its hold just by being first, I have one word for you: Meerkat. Read more But should Slack be worried?—According to ZDNet’s Ed Bott, there’s a huge difference between Microsoft Teams and Slack despite superficial similarities. Slack, he says, is a product while Teams is a Feature of Office 365, which also includes email, Skype, Office apps, and a terabyte of OneDrive for Business storage. Another difference: Slack enables contractors and other outsiders to participate in a team (without paying for a license for outside collaborators).  The takeaway: Bott believes the markets for Slack and Teams are different. That sounds right, for the most part; smaller companies using Slack as a collaboration tool may not have the need to pay more for a suite of tools they don’t really need. On the other hand, all those companies using Slack and Office 365 may just dump Slack in favor of the integrated suite of tools they’re already paying for that now includes a collaboration package. Read more The perils of election-themed marketing—Starbucks no doubt thought it was creating a campaign that would resonate with everyone on both sides of the American political spectrum. But its green “unity” cup has provoked harsh responses, ranging from accusations of “political brainwashing” and “spreading liberal bias” to threats of a boycott. Starbucks always comes out with a seasonal cup as the holidays approach, and some are upset this one isn’t more overtly Christmas-themed. According to CEO Howard Schultz, the cup was designed as “a reminder of our shared values and the need to be good to each other.” The takeaway: Even if you think your message is noble and appealing to everyone, a divisive political season is bound to produce negative reactions to anything with an election theme. Steer clear. Read more New YouTube creator tools aim to make it more social—YouTube has introduced new features designed to improve the ease with which creators can build community and recognize their most ardent fans. Creators can “pin” comments to the top of a thread and a comment from the channel owner gets special visual treatment to make it stand out. Creators can also “heart” comments from fans. The takeaway: Anything to improve the cesspool of YouTube comments is welcome, but i especially like giving more control of the community to the channel owner/creator. Businesses that have used YouTube as storage for videos can think about nurturing a fan base. Read more Live video streaming comes to Kickstarter—Using Facebook Live, Twitter Periscope, or YouTube Live, brands and individuals can live-stream video to anybody about anything. The strength of live-streaming is getting a boost, though, from Kickstarter, which is a more focused venture. Kickstarter Live lets backers and creators interact via live-streaming video. Early testers of the service used it for everything from live product demonstrations to cooking classes. According to TNW, “If potential backers can see a product being used in real-time, they may be more confident that they’ll actually get something for their money.” The intimacy of real-time video can also strengthen the connection between creators and backers. The takeaway: Every company will soon need to assess whether real-time video has a place not just in their strategies for Facebook, Twitter, and the like, but even on their owned properties. Read more Vine founders release live video app—Like we need another one? Hype is an iOS-only app (so far) from the founders of Vine (those guys whom Twitter didn’t bother to notify they were shutting down) that will go head-to-head with Twitter’s Periscope (not to mention Facebook Live). It’s not just another clone, though. Hype lets users “share a variety of multimedia content into the live broadcast—so, for example, a streamer using Hype can include cameras or videos from their device’s camera roll, blending their live content with stuff they made earlier.” They can also add music and emojis, and they can use video as the background for their video. The takeaway: The features sound nifty, but building audiences that already exist for Periscope (on Twitter) and Facebook Live (on Facebook) will be hard. I expect to see some brands try it out as a way to offer more visually rich broadcasts. ReEad more MasterCard releases Blockchain APIs—Blockchain is complex and extremely geeky, but here’s the thing: You WILL be communicating to your stakeholders about how it is changing your company’s or client’s business, so you might as well get up to speed. The impact of blockchain will be similar to the impact of the Internet: world-changing. By way of evidence, consider the both MasterCard and Visa are getting involved. Visa has released a B2B blockchain of its own, while MasterCard has developed a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) designed to as experiments for interact with its own internal blockchain to enter into smart contracts and settle payments. The company says more is to come. The takeaway: Go ahead. Unsubscribe from this newsletter because you think blockchain is so far outside the scope of PR and marketing that I’m just being ridiculous. But when blockchain rocks your world in a year or two (okay, maybe three), I want you to let me know so I can say I told you so. Read more Trends Brands ride Cubs’ coattails—I’m shocked—shocked, I tell you—to find that brands were quick to send out marketing messages when the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series in 108 years. Some had a connection to the news, like Nike. A bunch of Chicago-based companies (United, Allstate, Motorola) had legitimate connections to the team. For other brands, though, it was one more example of why real-time marketing is quickly running its course. The takeaway: Will anybody decide to shop at Staples because they tweeted out a W formed from paper clips? Or ride the Long Island Railroad because they shared a picture of a train from 1908? If there’s a connection, fine, I suppose, go ahead and offer up congratulations. If not, your time is better spent on efforts that might convert to sales or leads. Confine your real-time efforts to public affairs issues. Read more Google’s app store is getting a makeover—The overhaul of the Google Play store is noteworthy because of the rationale: It will accommodate Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, mobile payment options, and wearable devices. The takeaway: A more cohesive and comprehensive apps store will make it easier for Android users to find and install what they need to take advantage of newer and emerging smartphone capabilities. It should also serve as a warning to communicators and marketers that these capabilities are quickly becoming mainstream. Read more Yogurt company gets customer support for employing refugees—I have been reporting here for years the research that reinforces the importance of companies standing up for societal causes. Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya was receiving death threats for his efforts to hire refugees for his upstate New York factory. Right-wing websites have called for boycotts. But customers are rallying to demonstrate support for Ulukaya. Brandwatch ran its sentiment analysis software and found mostly positive references, while some of the negative messages were intentionally crafted to drown out the truly hateful posts. The brand’s hashtags, such as #RefugeesWelcomne and #BuyChobani—have been trending. The issue could even be translating into sales increases (at least for the short term). The takeaway: The Edelman Trust Barometer makes it clear that customers don’t want companies to sit on the sidelines; they want companies to use their clout to affect social change. It’s personal for Ulukaya, an immigrant himself, and though he has been criticized for being too public with his views, it’s clear his customers appreciate his efforts. Last week I reported on a study that correlated Chobani-like behavior with improved sales. The Chobani case study seems to bear that out. Read more Native advertising’s star continues to rise—Native advertising will make up 25% of advertising revenues for news media companies by 2018, more than doubling the 11% it accounts for now. The Native Advertising Institute and the International news Media Association surveyed 156 publishers worldwide to arrive at the figure. The study also found that 48% of newspaper media are selling native ad space and 39% more plan to make their space available for native ads. The takeaway: In the PESO model—paid/earned/social/owned—communicators in every discipline should explore the potential of native advertising as a means of expanding reach to the right audiences and building credibility. Be sure to explore the variety of types of native advertising to select those that will best suit your strategy. Read more One class of native ads may be fading—You see them at the end of articles on all kinds of sites, lists of articles from around the web you may be interested in. They often have little in common with the story you just read or your interests. But they’re a cheap way for advertisers to reach large audiences for not so much money. Some publishers, though, are worried that these ads are turning off readers (especially when they take readers to dodgy websites), leading Slate and The New Yorker, among others, to remove them. Others could soon follow. The takeaway: The industry has a small window of time to get native advertising right, and these “promoted stories” widgets from companies like Outbrain are failing miserably. It didn’t have to be this way. Sharing truly relevant content would have made this category of native advertising desirable rather than a liability. Read more Research Data is the new influencer—The power of data to influence the public is growing, according to the first-ever public opinion poll about public attitudes, knowledge, and behavior about data. The study, From Hill+Knowlton Strategies and Research+Data Insights finds that only a third of the public understands data even though most trust it. According to the study, 80% of the public want data to help them identify news sources to trust, 60% want it to help them figure out where to live, and 49% think it can help them pick the right candidate to support in an election. Eighty-eight percent say claims are more persuasive if they’re backed up by data. Among the 36% of Americans who are data-literate, only 6% are data-savvy. These are part of a new class of “data influencers,” having an impact on the attitudes and actions of those around them. The takeaway: Using data to support claims is becoming more important, but equally important is helping educate the public about data in general—kind of like the balancing act marketers are going to have to play with Artificial Intelligence. Read more The truth about the Dark Web—Watch cyberthrillers and you can be excused for thinking the Dark Web is populated with child porn, drug dealers, and all manner of other illicit and criminal activity. The truth is, according to research from Terbium Labs, more than half of what occupies the Dark Web is perfectly legal. The Dark Web isn’t searchable by Google or other indexers and can’t be accessed with a normal Web browser; rather, you need to use the privacy-protecting browser Tor. According to the study’s authors, “Anonymity does not equate criminality, merely a desire for privacy. The takeaway: Among those using Tor are journalists, human-rights advocates, and political dissidents. Increasingly, companies will also have to account for the desire among many of their stakeholders for privacy. Read more Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots CNN Kik bot will keep young users updated on election night—Kik was the first messaging app to offer a centralized place to find chatbots and CNN wants to tap the app’s 13-to-17-year-old user base. The cable news network’s Kik bot will deliver real-time election results along with custom Clinton and Trump emojis, GIFs, smilies, and stickers featuring CNN talent including Anderson Cooper. The takeaway: The 13-to-17 set doesn’t sit in front of a TV watching news, but CNN wants to be their source anyway and sees a bot as a means to make that happen. It’s a strategy worth watching and, if that demographic is important to you, emulating. Read more Yahoo aggregates its bots—Yep, Yahoo is still around and making some interesting moves as it awaits approval of its acquisition by Verizon. Among them: an app called Yahoo Bots for iOS and Android that serves as a central collection of its various virtual assistants, including Yahoo news, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo Finance, and Blitz (for fantasy football players). More could be added soon. The takeaway: Making it easier to find bots will accelerate their adoption. Microsoft is already launching a bot search engine. Read more Case studies of marketers using AI are all about brand experience—Feel like a bowl of soup? Specifically, Campbell Soup? You can ask IBM’s Watson for recipes based on the weather where you live, the kinds of flavors you like, and even what groceries are in your fridge and pantry. Sesame Street is employing Watson to produce personalized learning for children. USAA customers can ask an AI-imbued personal assistant called Eva who, for now, can help navigate information but down the road will review and analyze customers’ financial information and make money management recommendations. BMW’s opt-in AI learns about you to help you navigate around traffic, find your parked car, or give you walking directions once you park. The takeaway: Last week I shared a survey of CMOs that found most believe AI will have a greater impact on marketing and communications than social media. These examples should help cement that idea for you. AI is, without question, the biggest thing on the communications horizon. Read more Twitter enters the bot fray—Twitter is introducing bots companies can use to automate customer service inquiries. The bots will interact within the Direct Message part of Twitter to deliver automated welcome messages and quick replies to basic questions. “Quick replies let businesses prompt people with the ways to reply to a DM, whether by choosing from a list of options or prompting users to enter specific text values,” according to C|Net. The takeaway: Bots represent a technology with clear communication implications. With Microsoft and Facebook among those developing platforms for bot development, and now Twitter offering some basic bot functionality for brands, communicators should explore where bots will play a role in everything from media and investor relations to internal communications. Read more IBM’s Watson now part of Staples mobile ordering—Mobile is a big part of the future of commerce, but it’s still often cumbersome. Office supply retailer Staples thinks AI can make it easier. By employing IBM’s Watson, customers will be able to “order anytime, anywhere, from any device they prefer, including by text message.” Watson will be able to answer questions and initiate actions like returns. Customers will also be able to speak their order into the phone, which Watson will process. The takeaway: AI will soon be at the heart of all such transactional processes, which will be as easy as Captain Kirk saying, “Computer…” Read more New chatbots let marketers analyze campaigns—Among the variety of chatbots flooding the market, four are designed to help marketers monitor, analyze, and (in some cases) manage campaigns from within messaging apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger. Simple natural-language queries will allow marketers to conduct their analysis from within messaging without needing to log into the advertising platform. The takeaway: If you think of this category of chatbots as “virtual assistants,” you can start to see the possibility for the vast array of different tasks they can help you accomplish more easily than was possible before. Read more Microsoft introduces Concept Graph to aid AI learning—Artificial Intelligence enables tools like Siri and Amazon’s Echo to understand an inquiry regardless of how it is phrased. To aid AI in understanding what people mean, Microsoft has released Concept Graph, a database of words connected to concepts. Here’s the idea: People have an advantage over machines in that we already understand a broad range of concepts (e.g., dates, people, objects). We’re able to conceptualize the idea, say, that a hamburger is food or a shirt is apparel. The Concept Graph is designed to help machines understand sentences by providing them with “common-sense computing capabilities.” The database contains 5.4 million concepts. Concept Graph competes with Google’s Knowledge Graph, which contains 70 billion facts. The takeaway: Tools to aid in machine learning are being introduced at a steady clip, signaling a big imminent leap in AI’s functionality. Read more Virtual and Augmented Reality A VR e-commerce experience with no headset required—Wrap your mind around this, if you can. Hormel wants you to buy bacon in an immersive VR environment that require neither an app nor a headset. Just visit the site and you can hold the phone up to your eyes for a semi-immersive experience. It works better with a Cardboard headset; Hormel is even distributing a limited number of bacon-scented headsets. To make an actual purchase, you’ll just use your eyes to complete the transaction. The takeaway: I tried it on my laptop, which left something to be desired. When I get back to my office, I’ll pop my phone into my Cardboard goggles and see if it’s better. But admit it: You’re intrigued. And as for VR E-Commerce, expect to hear more about this concept. Read more Conde Nast tests print-based AR—Conde Nast is the first brand to try HTC’s Vivepaper, a QR-like code printed on paper that triggers a VR headset to display virtual content on top of the paper. A camera built into HTC’s Vive headset sees and tracks your interaction with the page. The concept isn’t new. Companies like Metaio (recently acquired by Apple) did something similar with your phone: Open the app, scan the code on the printed page, and the page came to life with video, extended content, and more. With HTC’s technology, though, you are immersed in a virtual world that includes a slice of the real world: the document you’re holding. Vivepaper will also work for Android and iOS owners using mobile VR headsets like Cardboard. The takeaway: The potential is huge but I wonder how many people are going to scramble to get their headsets to take advantage of it. While some believe we’ll eventually all wear normal-sized glasses that deliver AR, VR, and Mixed Reality, I remain skeptical. These technologies will be big, but people will use them when they decide to take the time, not whenever they happen to see a code on a printed page. At most, they’ll put the publication aside for later and, if they remember, will try it out later. Or not. Read more Mobile and Wearables Most Internet access is mobile—It’s official. Mobile devices—smartphones and tablets—access the Internet more than desktops and laptops. StatCounter Global Stats said mobile devices accounted for 51.3% of global Internet usage in October vs. 48.7% for laptops and desktops. The takeaway: This should come as no surprise. We have clearly been headed down this road. But if you needed convincing before, this ought to do the trick. We are rapidly headed to a mobile-dominant communication and productivity environment. Your communication strategies must account for this irrevocable trend. Read more More Internet use will be mobile next year—Fifty-one percent is nothing. By next year, 75% of Internet use will be driven by smartphones and tablets. That’s the projection from Zenith, a media buying agency (and a unit of Publicis Groupe SA). By the following year, mobile advertising spending will reach $134 billion (more than will be spent on newspaper, magazine, movie, and outdoor advertising combined). The takeaway: That ad projection is a startling wake-up call. And it doesn’t even account for advertising in VR and AR, which is undoubtedly coming sooner than we may think. Read more Stock Exchange taps Snapchat to attract Millennials—The venerable New York Stock Exchange has found success with Snapchat at reaching Millennials. Banners promoting its account adorn its New York building and has created geofilters around activities. For example, when Yum Brands (which trades on the NYSE) spun off its China assets, the exchange created geofilters covering its own Wall Street building, in Times Square, and at Yum Brands headquarters, where a graphic overlaid videos and images from Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. The NYSE has worked with other companies to create filters for use on the day of their IPOs. Metrics reveal that the strategy has paid off, with huge numbers of people adding the exchange and the brands its content supports as Snapchat contacts. The takeaway: If you want to attract the attention of a younger demographic, you need to use the tools they’re using. They won’t visit your website just because your goal is to drive traffic. And if the 224-year-old financial institution can do it, so can your company.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google launches RCS messaging for Android devices Google had acquired Jibe Mobile in October last year to adopt RCS standard. Earlier this year in February, Google teamed up with large number of global operators to accelerate the availability of RCS on Android devices. Earlier this week Google started rolling out Rich Communication Service (RCS) for select Google Messenger users. Now it has officially announced that it has partnered with U.S. carrier Sprint to launch RCS messaging to their customers using Android devices, starting today. Regarding this, Google, on the official blog, said: This will bring enhanced features including group chat, high-res photo sharing, read receipts, and more to the standard messaging experience on Android. Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through the Messenger app for Android devices, developed by Google. The service will be powered by the Jibe RCS cloud from Google. All new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android pre-loaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging starting from 2017. Subscribers currently using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will automatically get an app update to enable this feature, and subscribers using other Android devices can download Messenger from the Play store. Google said that it is planning to launch RCS messaging with more partners in the coming months. "Google launches RCS messaging for Android devices", 5 out of 5 based on 10 ratings.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 5 November 2016 | MYT 8:00 AM NFL throws first VR pass to Google Daydream, YouTube by todd spangler Throwing a VR pass to Google: NFL Films is partnering with Google to produce a nine-part series offering a 360º perspective of life in and around the NFL, covering players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans. — AFP LOS ANGELES: The National Football League is producing its first original VR series, launching exclusively on YouTube and Google's Daydream View virtual-reality headset starting later this month.  But the project underscore that it's still early in the VR game – with the league tapping the tech as a promotional fan-engagement vehicle, rather than a revenue driver.  NFL Films will produce a nine-part series offering a 360º perspective of life in and around the NFL, covering players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans. The series of five- to 10-minute episodes, marking the first episodic VR sports programme, will center on how the denizens of Football Nation prepare for game day.  The VR content will be free, with the first episode of the series to be available on the NFL's YouTube channel on Thanksgiving Day (Nov 24). Later this year, episodes will also be available via the NFL's VR app designed for Daydream View, Google's mobile VR headset that works with its new Pixel phones set to begin shipping Nov. 10, along with other immersive experiences.  "Virtual reality is an emerging platform that enables content experiences with a truly unique vantage point that brings fans closer to the game," said Vishal Shah, the NFL's senior VP of digital media. "We want to get better acquainted with the technology, the platform, the content we can actually create... and how our fans are engaging in the content and viewing it."  Shah declined to say what the NFL is spending on the VR series. Google is contributing staff and equipment for the project, and is helping the NFL develop the app for the Daydream View platform. NFL Films also is working with production company Two Bit Circus VR on the series.  NFL Films is currently in production on the series, which is being shot using Google's Jump 360º camera rig system. In the first episode, viewers will spend a week with the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line as they prepare for an upcoming game.  Subsequent episodes will tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, go inside Green Bay's distinctive football culture, and offer an insider's look at the San Diego Chargers organization.  The league experimented with virtual reality in 2015, and showcased some initial VR content at events including Super Bowl 50's NFL Experience fan convention in San Francisco.  The NFL launched its official YouTube channel in January 2015, and since then it's generated more than 1 billion video views.  The YouTube channel currently carries game previews, in-game highlights, post-game recaps, and news, analysis, fantasy football advice, and other short-form content from NFL Media properties.  Additionally, 96 classic NFL games – three for each of the league's 32 teams – are posted in their entirety on the NFL's YouTube channel. — Reuters You May Be Interested Facebook glitch turns user profiles into memorial pages Twitter impresses advertisers with BuzzFeed US election livestream Silicon Valley still reeling as reality of Trump presidency sets in Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Snap Inc. amended its charter to ensure that its founders retain majority voting control after the company’s initial public offering, giving them more control than the founders at Facebook Inc. and Google had after those companies went public. Separately, Google quietly made an undisclosed investment in Snapchat. Chief executive officer Evan Spiegel and co-founder and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy together control about 74% of the company, according to an analysis by Equidate, a stock market for private technology companies. That compares with the 41% that Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin had after their IPO, and the 56% Mark Zuckerberg held after Facebook’s. Snap, formerly known as Snapchat, is asking public-market investors to back its management team and support their potential to build the next technology juggernaut. The company behind the social media app that’s wildly popular with teens and millennials is aiming to raise as much as $4 billion in an IPO that could value it at $25 billion to $35 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. This year, Snap is aiming for revenue of $350 million. Snap plans to go public as early as March. The filing Monday in Delaware, which laid out the founders’ voting rights, indicates that the company is cleaning up its ownership structure in preparation. Google seems to approve. Alphabet Inc.’s growth equity division, previously called Google Capital, renamed itself to CapitalG on Friday. With the re-brand, the firm also disclosed a recent investment in Snap. A spokeswoman for CapitalG declined to share the total investment.

They’re both supposed to be smart assistants, and part of that is answering your questions, no matter how dumb they are. In some cases, Alexa relies on skills that you have to enable, and those are only as good as the third-party creators make them. I tried asking Alexa for a Barefoot Contessa recipe, but even with the Food Network skill enabled, she was stumped. For many of its answers, the Google Home pulls from Google’s knowledge graph. Sometimes that makes for helpful answers, but other times, the answers are not quite right or out of date. Related: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker Here’s what happened when we asked the Amazon Dot and the Google Home a number of the same questions. Both are pretty good at giving the news. What’s the news? Alexa: “Here’s your flash briefing…” followed by NPR news, which I selected as one of my preferences. Home: “Here’s the latest news…” followed by an NPR news summary brought to me by a Chipotle ad. And they can each answer straightforward questions: When is Pi Day? Alexa: Pi Day will be on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. Home: Pi Day is on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. It’s easy enough to ask either Alexa or Google Home for the weather, but I wanted to try something a little more colloquial: Do I need a coat? Alexa: “I added coat to your shopping list.” Home: “Today in Portland, expect a high of 64 degrees and a low of 46 degrees.” Similarly, instead of asking specifically about the World Series during Game 7, I went for a less direct approach: “How are the Cubs doing?”   Alexa: “I don’t know how to answer your question. Home: “The Cubs are up six to three…” I honestly needed to know the answer to this question and decided to put Alexa and the Home to the test: What’s a substitute for coriander? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “According to Rachael Ray, if you are preparing a dish with dried coriander, cumin is a great substitution, as it provides a similar warm, spicy flavor.” Home also pointed out that cilantro, “which people either love or hate,” are the leaves of the coriander plants. Neither is all that great at giving recipes, though: What should I make for dinner tonight? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Let’s look for dinner options. What kind of food are you looking for?” I said, “Something healthy,” and the Home gave me a list of nearby restaurants. What’s a good chicken recipe? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Next, I decided to get political: Who should I vote for? Alexa: “You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies.” Home: “How you vote is up to you. I can look up information on the election, if you like.” Me: “OK.” Home: … Me: “What should I know about the election?” Home: “I can’t help with that yet.” Who’s going to win election? Alexa: “I can’t tell you who will win, but I can tell you who’s ahead in the polls. Just ask, who’s ahead in the polls.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Alexa: “According to Real Clear Politics’ average of national polling data between October 22 and November 1, Hillary Clinton is polling at 45.1 percent, Donald Trump at 43.1 percent, Gary Johnson at 4.6 percent, and Jill Stein at 2.1 percent.” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help, but I’m always learning.” Then I wanted to test their bilingual skills: How do you say “Hello” in Spanish? Alexa: “I can’t pronounce that but I’ve written the translation for you.” Home: “Buenos Dias!” How do you say, “I don’t know” in French? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Je ne sais pas.” I actually knew the answer to this next question, but I was trying to think of something a five-year-old would ask: What do koalas eat? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question. Home: “Leaves. According to Australian Koala Foundation, an adult koala eats between 200 to 500 grams of leaves each day. Koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. Occasionally, they will eat the leaves from some other native Australian trees, and they also use certain trees just for resting in.” Note: When I was transcribing the answer, I had to ask the question a couple of times, and Home once gave me the definition for equality instead. Both have some decent entertainment skills: Tell me a joke Alexa: “Why wasn’t the turkey hungry on Thanksgiving? Because he’s already stuffed.” Home: “What do you get when you put a vest on an alligator? An investigator.” Neither gave me exactly what I wanted when it came to this music request, though: Play “Dreaming” by Smashing Pumpkins Alexa: Played a 30-second preview, since I didn’t have it saved to my music library. Home: Started playing Siamese Dream I saw the casting news yesterday but couldn’t remember it: Who’s going to be in the Wrinkle in Time movie? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find an answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Note: I was thinking of Rowan Blanchard, but apparently Zach Galifianakis has been cast as well. I figured this was a pretty straightforward question but both struggled: How many Grammys has Beyoncé won? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to that question.” Home: “Beyoncé won the Grammy Award for Best R&B song.” Note: That’s just one of Beyoncé’s 20 Grammys. The Home’s answer to this made me think of this Simpsons moment: How many kids does Brad Pitt have? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer.” Home: “Six. His children include Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, and others.” The Jolie-Pitt kids in turn made me think of Mindy Kaling. Google Home has the ability to answer follow-ups without you having to repeat who or what you’re talking about, so I wanted to test that out. I still had to say “Mindy Kaling” for every follow-up with Alexa, though: How old is Mindy Kaling? Alexa: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling married?” Alexa: “Sorry, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling’s show still on?” Alexa: “Hm, I couldn’t find any movies called Mindy Kaling.’” Home: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is she married?” Home: “According to E!, Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak’s relationship remains complicated. The 35-year-old actress…” Me: Is her show still on? Home: “Here’s some information for, ‘Is Ellen’s show still on…’” Finally, I wanted to see how much they knew about each other: How much does the Amazon Dot cost? Alexa: “The new Amazon Dot costs $49.99.” Home: “According to Business Insider, Amazon Prime membership costs $99 per year…” How much does Google Home cost? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “Google Home costs $129. The fabric or metallic bases are extra.” Also watch: Kasita: There’s no place like [this] home Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Due to the technological constraints imposed by simple messaging service (SMS), the cellular standard which powers basic text messaging, cellular messaging lacks support for the sort of animations, videos, and stickers which most clients boast. But that’s about to change. On Friday, Google announced that it will begin rolling out an advanced texting standard called rich client messaging, or RCS, to Android phones on the Sprint network. RCS is best described as text messaging on steroids — basically, it’s a modernized version of SMS that brings the aging standard up to par with clients like iMessage and Facebook Messenger. It supports features like group chats, read receipts (timestamps that indicate when a message has been received and seen), high-resolution photo sharing, and typing indicators (the animations that indicate when chat participants are pecking out sentences). It can transmit images and videos up to 100 times larger than multimedia text messaging, the outgoing standard that currently performs that legwork. And it features robust support for group messaging, including the ability to name groups, add new members, and leave existing groups. Related: Google Messenger 2.0 brings unread message badges — on certain Android devices The upgrade will begin in earnest later this year. Sprint subscribers with Android devices running KitKat 4.4 will see RCS become available in the coming weeks, provided they’ve installed Google’s Messaging application from Android’s Play Store app market and selected it as their default messaging app. Select LG and Nexus phones, meanwhile, will be “automatically upgraded” to RCS through a forthcoming app update. And owners of Google’s Pixel devices, which ship with Messenger preloaded, will have access to RCS as long as they don’t switch their default messaging app to another client. Eligible users will be notified via popup message when RCS becomes available. From within Messenger, they’ll be able to toggle a few of the standard’s features including read receipts, typing indicators, and whether or not data’s used for messaging. Taking advantage of RCS won’t be nearly as complicated in the future. Beginning next year, all Android devices sold by Sprint will come with Messenger configured as the default texting app. Related: T-Mobile breaks the limitations of regular, boring text messaging with advanced messaging  The launch is the fruit of Google’s Jibe Mobile purchase. The company’s technology, which Google acquired late last year, forms the framework of Google’s Universal RCS platform, a standardized text messaging platform the company announced at Mobile World Congress in February. In a speech to attendees, a Google representative promised a “consistent” and “inter-operable” version of the RCS spec that would work with non-Android devices and integrate with third-party APIs and open source tools. Indeed, Google’s RCS ambitious extend far beyond the Sprint network. The company intends to bring the spec to other carriers in the coming months, though it declines to say which. But its hands are tied. RCS, unlike the messaging technologies behind internet-based clients like Facebook Messenger, requires support at the cellphone carrier level, and the uptake has been slow: only 49 carriers worldwide have adopted RCS since its debut in 2007. (A notable holdout in the U.S. is Verizon, the nation’s largest cellular provider.) Worse yet, fragmentation is beginning to emerge: many of those carriers are on an older version of RCS that’s only partial compatibility with the flavor that Sprint and others plan to implement. Related: Google aims to beef up text messages with open source system And then there’s the elephant in the room: Google’s own internet-based messaging platforms, all of which eschew support for RCS in favor of older or proprietary alternatives. Google’s new Allo client, which comes pre-installed on Pixel phones, lacks robust support for cellular messaging. And Hangouts, the company’s all-in-one messaging client, has yet to implement RCS. But all the same, the search giant appears committed, at least in part, to moving toward the promised future of RCS: platform-agnostic advanced text messaging. “[Text messaging] is one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication today, used by billions of people worldwide,” Amir Sarhangi, head of Google’s RCS efforts, wrote in a blog post. “We’re excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the U.S.” Also watch: OnePlus 3 Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Those are the ones without the HTTPS at the beginning of its URL. Anyone looking at what you’re doing online on that site can capture all of your information, including important user names and passwords. Most of the pages desktop users load are encrypted according to Google. But it said the myriad of symbols used by most browsers can be confusing or even misleading about the sites' lack of security. So the Chrome team is launching an effort that will publicly shame nearly half of the world’s websites that don’t use strong encryption. Those sites have a few months to comply. Come January, Google will put a clear “Not Secure” warning next to thousands of popular online sites that use unencrypted HTTP connections.

A clean white minimalist speaker powered by Google Assistant (the same knowledge base central to Google Pixel), the smart device is a learning, context-capable database that offers improved listening and functionality miles ahead of the Echo Dot. GOOGLE HOME HERALDS IN THE FUTURE OF VOICE ASSISTANTS Standard to the voice assistant arsenal, Google Home can trigger music, podcasts, or radio from a simple voice command, pulling your favorite playlists from services like Spotify and Pandora. Backed by the algorithms that made Google famous, Home is also privy to a growing list of questions, ranging from calculations, to nutrition facts, to asking for help in another language. Prompted by “Ok Google,” the speaker picks up your commands using Far-field voice recognition, without worry of having to repeat a phrase because you mumbled or stuttered. Further extending the trend of digitized assistants, you can let Google Home set timers, tell you the weather, relay traffic patterns, and even create to-do lists and events. As we enter the smart home era and the Internet of Things, Google Home has include multiple smart device control and compatibility, including a Google Home app for the smartphone, useful for adjusting volume from afar. Use Home to adjust your Nest Thermostat, or play YouTube videos from your living room. Additional speakers can also be synced for interactivity across multiple rooms. Beyond it’s interaction with other devices, Home is also designed with the user in mind. Interact with the speaker’s touch-top surface (which offers volume control and push requests), and easily mute with the touch of a button. You can decide when Google Home is listening or not, and the four multi-color lights at the top of the surface indicate when it’s waiting for a command. The bottom part of the speaker is also fully customizable, with a wide variety of colors, for $20 a piece. A recent review of the voice assistant speaker on Gizmodo was positive towards Home’s ability to listen and the context driven nature of the prompts, which allow for more varied language. However, like most voice-command products, Home still takes things a little too literally; questions still need to be simple, and don’t expect it to understand everything you want it to do. Google Home is pricier than the Echo, but in comparison, its improvements outweigh the price increase. For those looking to slowly extend their smart home capabilities, this is a recommended next step.

The smart speaker that's infused with Google Assistant can be yours for $129. It's Google's direct competitor for Amazon's Echo line, which means you shouldn't expect it to ever be sold by the mega-retailer. Google Home is a US-only product for now. Aside from being able to talk to it and ask it various questions, you can also control certain smart home devices (the list of supported ones should grow in the future). The 4K Chromecast Ultra which Google announced alongside the Home speaker has started shipping today, for those who pre-ordered from the Google store. The $69 device isn't officially available in any brick and mortar stores yet. And speaking of things that aren't officially available, the Daydream View VR headset should only be out on November 10, according to Google itself. That said, some people who have pre-ordered the Daydream View are starting to receive their units, which have been shipped early. That would normally be cause for celebration, but in this case there's a problem: using the headset requires an app called Google VR Services, which simply doesn't exist on the Play Store yet. We assume that will be published on November 10, so if you do get your Daydream View early, it looks like you'll have to wait a few days before you can use it.

Apple learned early on that controlling all entire hardware and software was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first -- Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32gb or 128gb of storage. The sleep/wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement -- it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep/wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 mAh battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios -- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with NFC. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. Thanks to Verizon for the review phone. Google Pixel Pros: Looks like an iPhone, solid build, pure Android experience, great camera. Cons: Not water-resistant, no external storage. Bottom line: Great handsets that really allow Android to shine.

Business Technology Is Google Fiber going wireless for the last mile? Google Fiber has paused the rollout of new cities for its high speed Internet service while its explores other technology options. Reuters Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A key hurdle to widespread gigabit-speed Internet is the high cost of getting fiber optic lines over the last mile -- from the fiber backbone in nearby streets to each house. But increasingly, cellular operators, broadband providers including Google Fiber and several startups are exploring a new, less expensive way to bridge the last mile gap – wireless technology. Google Fiber – which named San Diego as a potential city for building an ultra-fast fiber optic Internet network -- said last month that it would pause future fiber optic roll outs in San Diego and seven other potential Google Fiber cities while it explored new approaches.  Among those is wireless, including high frequency airwaves, which can deliver gigabit data rates over short, line of sight distances but also tend to bounce erratically off obstacles and degrade in rain or fog. “Millimeter wave is one of several different technologies (Google Fiber) is looking at, but it does seem to have the most promise,” said Karl Bode of broadband watchdog DSL Reports. “There are line of sight issues here, and weather can impact signal,” he continued.  “As such you need transmitters relatively close to the home, meaning you still have some notable deployment costs. Still, that's cheaper than digging up streets, which is why Google is interested.” Don’t expect Google Fiber to incorporate wireless into fiber networks anytime soon. There are still many questions about how viable wireless can be, and what licenses would be required from federal regulators in various airwave bands. But recent improvements in antenna technology and beam forming techniques to more precisely steer these high frequency airwaves are fueling optimism about their ability to span the last mile. Certain high frequency airwaves have been earmarked to become part of the spectrum dedicated for upcoming gigabit class 5G cellular networks. Last week, Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam spoke at the Intel Capital Global Summit in San Diego about the bandwidth capabilities of millimeter wave 5G technology, calling it “wireless fiber,” according to Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel’s mobile and Internet of things group. “I think he said 50 percent of his costs in a fiber roll-out is from the lamp post to the home,” said Renduchintala. “So he’s basically saying if I can get high-speed ‘wireless fiber’ to the house, it would make deployments much more rapid and much more economically viable.” Verizon built its FiOS fiber optic TV and Internet network in nine states but stopped expanding into new markets in 2010, in part because of high installation costs. In October, San Diego’s Qualcomm said it would deliver the first 5G mobile modem chip, called the Snapdragon X50, next year for testing. It expects to reach top-end download speeds of 5 gigabits per second when shows up in commercial devices in 2018. Qualcomm is targeting the X50 for mobile handsets. But analysts think that “fixed wireless” markets – such as boxes that link the fiber optic backbone in the street to individual homes  – also are potential uses of this technology. With five gigabits of bandwidth, users could download an entire digital movie in less than a minute.  Skyriver, a San Diego start-up, recently completed field trials for millimeter wave point-to-multi-point technology to fuel gigabit broadband. The company said it has been acquiring spectrum rights in millimeter wave bands in several markets. For Google, affordable bandwidth is the key to its Web businesses such as Google search and YouTube. In 2012, it got into the Internet Service Provider business with Google Fiber. Today 12 cities nationwide either have Google Fiber up and running or are in development. Google has worked with these cities to install fiber on existing power poles, among other things, to keep costs down. The company’s entrance into the high speed Internet business has spurred on cable and telecom competitors to ramp their fiber optic roll outs – though most have limited expansion to new housing developments. Google has been talking with eight additional cities – San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, Portland, Phoenix, Chicago, Jacksonville and Tampa – as the next potential markets for Google Fiber expansion. Last month, it put those plans on hold, raising concern that it had lost its enthusiasm for Google Fiber. . In its third quarter earnings conference call, Google/Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the company will continue to be an Internet Service Provider in the 12 existing cities where fiber is deployed or in the development pipeline.  “We are making great progress in those cities, and we remain very committed to growth across those cities,” she said. “We are pausing for now our work in eight cities where we have been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it is to better integrate some of the technology work we have been developing.” The company is still talking with San Diego officials about permitting, micro trenching and other issues, said Stacey LoMedico, San Diego’s assistant chief operating officer.  A meeting was held earlier this week. The two sides have not yet talked about wireless, said LoMedico. Last year, Google purchased San Francisco based Webpass, which uses point-to-point microwave to deliver high speed Internet to urban apartment buildings, condo complexes and businesses in San Diego and five other cities. The company is licensed in the 70/80 Gigahertz spectrum bands, according to a Google spokesperson. It installs large antennas on top of buildings to deliver point-to-point Internet. Its then distributes bandwidth to each apartment or office. “In San Diego, Google Fiber and Webpass will work together to extend and accelerate deployments via point-to-point wireless,” said a Google spokesperson in an email. “In addition as we’ve said, we’re actively expanding our roadmap to include innovative technologies like fixed wireless that expand access to more people, faster.” A key question is how far can a high bandwidth wireless signal travel to connect the fiber node to homes? Some companies have claimed the signals can travel a bit over a mile (about two kilometers) in tests. But industry analysts think it’s unlikely to be that far in actual deployments. “I don’t think there will be any trouble going a couple hundred meters, but I think a lot of engineers are trying to figure this out,” said Christopher Taylor, director of radio frequency/wireless components at industry research firm Strategy Analytics.   Three must-see headlines <h1>Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat</h1> <h1>'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever</h1> <h1>Five beers that made San Diego famous</h1> Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat 'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever Five beers that made San Diego famous See more videos mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com;  Twitter:@TechDiego 760-529-4973 Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 80°

We have accounts everywhere, letting us kill time at work on Facebook, check Twitter for the latest news, cruise Pinterest for inspirational moodboards and hit Amazon for great shopping deals. On top of that, most of us also have a pile of inactive accounts created for discounts or one-off purchases. With our digital footprints expanding, we are relaying more personal data than ever to trackers, hackers and marketers with and without our consent. Are we sharing too much? Do we have the right not to be tracked? Is withdrawing from the Internet entirely to preserve your privacy even possible? Let's go over each of these issues. Data dangers Creating profiles at sites you use regularly has many benefits such as ease of log-in and better suggestions for links or products you might like. But with growing concern over privacy terms that change at the drop of a hat, the sale of personal data by less scrupulous websites and the challenges of keeping stalker-y exes at bay, more and more Americans are deciding to reclaim and delete their personal data. If you're among the roughly 59% of Americans who use a single password for a handful of accounts, deleting inactive accounts is an important security measure. If a hacker cracked that password, you could suffer a domino-effect hacking of your other accounts too, especially if they are linked via a common email address. Aside from the accounts and profiles we willingly create, our data is also exposed as hundreds of people search websites that comb police records, courthouse records and other public records such as real estate transactions, making our personal data publicly available to anyone who look for it. Deleting this data isn't as easy you might expect — and many companies won't remove your personal details fully. Deleting your online presence Tracking down all your data won't be easy. There is no one service that will trawl the Internet for pieces of you, so you’ll have to dig deep and create a master list of every account you’ve created in your internet life. Start with JustDelete.me A site called JustDelete.me provides an incredibly comprehensive list of email, social media, shopping and entertainment sites along with notes on how difficult it is to completely erase your account and links to actually get it done. This is a great resource to help you remember and find unused profiles as well as gauging how much effort you'll have to expend to shut it down. Find other open accounts Next, review your email accounts, looking for marketing updates and newsletters, to get wind of other accounts you may still hold or companies that have bought your email address. Then go through your phone and check for apps that have required you to create accounts. Once you've created a list of accounts you then should sort them according to how often you use them, if at all. Delete any you don't use. “Data is an asset to these companies,” says Jacqui Taylor, CEO of web science company Flying Binary. "Not only are these companies able to monetize you as their product, you aren't even receiving a service in exchange.” Working off your list of accounts, head back to JustDelete.me and use it as a springboard to start deleting accounts. Account Killer has a similar offering, and additionally can check every site you browse to for how easy it is to remove an account – before you actually create that account. To do that, grab its SiteCheck bookmarklet downloadable for Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. If you find it tough to cancel certain accounts – for example, a subscription that mysteriously keeps on renewing, or customer service that just won’t take you off their systems – you might want to outsource the heavy lifting with Cancel Wizard, which charges $35 per cancellation to take care of hassling the rogue site on your behalf. (It appears on AccountKiller as a link to a ‘third-party cancellation form’.) Downloading and removing your content If there's data you'd like to keep — say, photos or contact lists — you may be able to download them before deleting your account. Facebook and Twitter data can be downloaded in the respective Settings tabs, while LinkedIn contacts can be exported via Contact Settings. At many sites such as Evernote and Pinterest, you won't be able to delete your account. You can only deactivate it and then manually remove personal data. At sites such as Apple, this process includes a call to customer service. Erasing your image from public spheres  Then there are the outdated or otherwise unwanted photos floating around random sites – your bio pic from the first company you worked at, or that eyes-half-shut number from that networking cocktail night. Start by searching for your name in Google, selecting the Images tab. Note what sites the pictures of you are appearing on, then individually contact the webmasters of the sites they appear on. You might do this through a contact box on the site, or by Googling the term “WhoIs [site address]” to find the registration info, including email address. If there isn’t one – or if you have no luck directly contacting the webmaster – try contacting their site’s hosting provider, which usually turns up in this search. If the photos are from accounts you’ve just shut down (or otherwise recently deleted), they may continue to appear in search results for some weeks; in that case, you can make a request for Google to remove the outdated links here. Google may also remove certain images from appearing in search results – if they contain sensitive info, like a photo of your signature or financial account details, of if they’re “revenge porn”. You can make the request here you would still need to contact the site owner to remove the images themselves, as the URL can still be found through other search engines and social media, for example.  Don't forget background checking sites To find out which background check websites have posted information about you, check out the list of popular sites on this Reddit thread. Then go to each and try searching for your name. See if you pop up in the first few pages of search results. If you do, the same Reddit thread has information on opting out, but get ready for a hassle: usually calling, faxing and sending in physical proof that you are who you say you are. After that, expect to wait anywhere from 10 working days to six weeks for information to disappear. Shutting down email You may want to reduce your internet footprint by erasing rarely used email accounts, or to stopper spam from one that’s been hacked. Head to your email account’s settings and select to delete your account. If you’re diverting email from a lesser-used account, remember to send out a message with your preferred contact details first. It’s worth noting that while Gmail makes your email address unavailable to anyone else in the future, Outlook.com releases it 60 days after you delete your account. The final comb Remember that Google – and most other search engines – personalize search results according to what you’ve searched for and clicked on in the past, potentially leaving out other pages where your info has appeared. Sign out of your account, and perform another search for your name. We’ve focused on Google as it claims 73% of global desktop searches; but it’s worth searching for your name on Bing (9%) and Yahoo (7%) to see if further instances of your name or image crop up. To request outdated content be removed, you can contact Bing here; Yahoo only removes outdated search results every six to eight weeks.  Sites that don’t allow complete withdrawal A large number of companies make it impossible to delete all traces of your accounts. According to JustDelete.me, this list includes Etsy, the online marketplace for home crafters, which retains your email address no matter what; Gawker Media, which retains the rights to all posts you made; and Netflix, which keeps your watch history and recommendations “just in case you want to come back.” Then there's Twitter, which signed a deal with the Library of Congress in 2013 giving it the right to archive all public tweets from 2006 on. This means that anything you've posted publicly since then is owned by the government and will stay archived even if you delete your account. To prevent future tweets from being saved, convert your settings to private so that only approved followers can read your tweets. (Go to the settings in the security and privacy section.) Shut down your Facebook account by going to Settings, Security and then click “Deactivate my account.” You can download all of your posts and images first by going to Settings, General and then click “Download a copy of your Facebook data.” However, you've already agreed to the social media giant’s terms and conditions, which state that Facebook has the right to keep traces of you in its monolithic servers, basically any information about you held by another Facebook user (such as conversations still in the other person's inbox or your email address if it's in a friend's contact list) will be preserved. The divide between companies that make it easy to delete your data and the companies that make it difficult is clear. “If you're the product (on such free services as the social platforms), the company tends to make it difficult,” Taylor says. Monetizing your data is the basis of the business model for such companies. For services like eBay and Paypal, Taylor adds, you aren't the product (both collect fees from sellers), making it easier to delete your account and associated data. The right to be forgotten Being able to erase social and other online data is linked to a larger issue: the right to be forgotten online. In the European Union, a Court of Justice ruling gave EU residents the right to request that irrelevant, defamatory information be removed from search engine databases. However, no such service is available to the residents of United States. “You should be able to say to any service provider that you want your data to be deleted,” Taylor says. “If someone leaves this earth, how can their data still be usable by all these companies?” When erasure isn’t an option Much of our personal data online is hosted on social platforms that regularly update their terms of service to change how our data can be used. A privacy policy that you were comfortable with when you signed on could evolve to become something you don’t agree with at all. “Your digital footprint is not under your control if you're using these free services,” Taylor says. But in an increasingly connected, virtual age, it can seem inconceivable not to have a footprint at all. Most of us use a social account to log in to dozens of other sites. Some sites require that you do so: for example, Huffington Post requires a Facebook log-in, while YouTube commenters need a Google account. Employers frequently perform background checks through Google or dedicated third-party social media checkers. In many professions, an online portfolio of work on the likes of WordPress or Tumblr is a necessity. It's becoming increasingly difficult to communicate socially without the aid of a Facebook or Twitter account. Given the realities of our connected world today, not being online can be seen as a negative. The key, Taylor says, is to take ownership of your data. Control how much of your personal data is available online by pruning inactive accounts. Create new accounts selectively, and post with the understanding that within a single update to the terms of service, your data could become publicly shared or further monetized.

Reply Facebook problem From Gina on August 05, 2015 :: 6:45 pm I deleted my FB acct over a year ago. Recently, a friend talked me into trying again. After filling in my info, I see that now, you must have a cell phone, which I don’t have, or upload an ID with your “authentic” name. I’ve been known by a nickname most of my life. It is not an “alias” or a “fake name,” it is a nickname. My friends, business associates, know me by this name. It is not the name on my ID. It is not similar. FB keeps asking for an ID with the nickname on it. I uploaded my ID with my legal name on it, but since the names don’t match, I cannot access my acct. I wish I could just delete this acct, but I cannot do it, as I cannot log in. I have e-mailed FB at least 7 times, sent a snail mail letter, but this acct is stuck. What to do? Reply Can't remove my info From Crystal Satterlee on August 14, 2015 :: 5:14 pm How to I remove my info from a site like this? http://www.uglyhomewrecker.com/ Reply That's going to be difficult From Josh Kirschner on August 14, 2015 :: 6:24 pm That’s incredibly spiteful of whoever put up that site, when it would seem the anger should be directed primarily at Doug. Your best bet is to talk to an attorney to see what your legal options are. but I’m not sure you have many. Unless the information on the site is untrue, you probably can’t sue for libel, and the First Amendment will likely trump any privacy rights. One option you may have is to play tit for tat. Threaten the website owner (who I assume you know exactly who it is) that you will put up an nearly identical site outing Doug, with his full name and details, along with the text conversation. The situation should be equally embarrassing to him and his wife. Perhaps that will encourage whoever to up the site to take it down. Let me know how things work out. Caveat: I am not an attorney. You should check with an attorney before embarking on any specific path.

Without fanfare, the familiar yellow Snapchat ghost logo was added to the Capital G website (formerly known as Google Capital) Friday. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. The addition was first reported by Business Insider. CapitalG has also invested in tech start-ups Airbnb, Uber, SurveyMonkey, Glassdoor and the Duolingo language learning app. Snapchat raised $1.81 billion in funding earlier this year, the company reported in a regulatory finding, and many press reports have said the company was on the cusp of filing an IPO in early 2017 worth anywhere from $25 to $40 billion. Snap has declined to comment. In 2013, several bloggers reported Google offered $4 billion to buy the company, then known as Snapchat, after Snap spurned Facebook's $3 billion offer. Snap and Alphabet declined comment on the Capital G investment. On its website, Capital G says its goal is "to make returns-driven investments in leading companies around the world and help entrepreneurs rapidly grow their businesses."

Messages based on the RCS spec will upgrade the SMS experience for mobile users. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service (SMS). "Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through the Messenger apps for Android devices, developed by Google," Amir Sarhangi head of RCS, said in announcing the launch on Google Keyword blog. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year, Sarhangi said. Existing Sprint subscribers using certain LG and Nexus phone models will automatically receive the new Messenger as an over-the-air update next year. Meanwhile, Sprint subscribers using other devices will be able to download the Messenger version with RCS via Google's Play store. Google will launch RCS with more partners in the next few months, Sarhangi added. RCS is an attempt by the GSM Association (GSMA) to develop a specification that mobile operators can use to deliver messaging services comparable to WhatsApp, Facebook and other mobile apps. Most of the SMS-based messaging services that mobile operators currently offer are harder to use and lack the rich multimedia functionality offered by such mobile apps. In addition to Sprint, a slew of other mobile operators, including Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Vodafone, Telenor Group, Bharti Airtel and Telstra, have committed to using RCS for their messaging services. Earlier this year, Google announced an initiative to work with several of these organizations to develop an Android RCS client and a common, universal profile for the RCS specification. The goal of that effort is to foster standards around RCS via the use of consistent feature sets, implementation protocols and configurations. The 58 GSMA carriers and manufactures that are engaged in the RCS initiative have agreed to use the common RCS specification—or Universal Profile for Advanced Messaging—that Google is developing. There will be two releases of the Universal Profile. The first one will launch on Nov. 17 and support a variety of capabilities, including chat, group chat, file transfer, audio messaging and video sharing across operators, according to the GSMA. The second release is scheduled for the second quarter of 2017 and will support more APIs and improved authentication and application security among other things. With this week's announcement, Sprint has become the first carrier to use the universal RCS profile. The service will be powered by Google's Jibe, an RCS cloud service.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

COMPUTER After Go, StarCraft II is officially the next game for AI to conquer Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains November 04, 2016 The next victims of the automated workforce. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains November 04, 2016 First, chess fell to AI. Then Atari, and soon after, the ancient Chinese board game Go. Now, it looks like StarCraft is the next to be dominated by self-learning machines. Google DeepMind and Blizzard announced on Nov. 4 a tool that allows artificial intelligence to directly play StarCraft II. The tool, a kind of digital controller that lets AI act as a player, was built specifically for developers to let AI bots interact with the game’s interface. Researchers at DeepMind, an AI unit of Google, say that StarCraft is a particularly difficult challenge in videogames because of its complexity. Players must manage resources like minerals and gas, control hundreds of individual units, and scout unseen areas of the game’s map. “StarCraft is an interesting testing environment for current AI research because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world,” writes Oriol Vinyals in a DeepMind blog post. “The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks.” DeepMind isn’t the first to tackle StarCraft games. The Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference has been running a StarCraft AI competition since 2010, and a host of papers around AI and StarCraft emerged this year from tech companies like Facebook. A long-spanning project at Berkeley called Overmind has focused on beating StarCraft: Brood War, a game that has an open-source API like DeepMind’s. However, this is the first time that Blizzard has announced official support for hackers trying create digital players. Some researchers on Twitter lamented that Blizzard only acknowledged the research around StarCraft when a big name like DeepMind showed interest. if only a large group of ai experts had been trying to work on starcraft for years with almost zero support from blizzard 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃 — 🍂 Mike Cook 🍂 (@mtrc) November 4, 2016 Computers already have some advantages over humans. A key figure in measuring the competence of StarCraft players is their actions per minute (APM). Humans have to click their mouse or type hotkeys to command their units. According to the StarCraft wiki, an advanced human player can perform about 2oo APM, easily attainable at the computational scale of DeepMind or Facebook. Research from Stanford in 2014 puts average APM for its StarCraft 2 bot at 1,000 to 2,000 while battling. Facebook just published two papers in the last two months about playing StarCraft, and its latest paper introduces its own open-source framework for Brood War called TorchCraft. Soumith Chintala, a researcher at Facebook’s AI lab, tweeted earlier that the company would be announcing the open-source code. Look forward to further announcements and our code release… :) https://t.co/wV567FDe8O — Soumith Chintala (@soumithchintala) November 3, 2016 Open-source code, like what DeepMind and Facebook are set to release, is fast becoming the norm in artificial-intelligence research. Many researchers believe that opening the field to others for research, while not giving away the secret sauce like the data under the algorithms, accelerates the speed at which breakthroughs occur. DeepMind says its open-source tool will be released next year. “One of the best ways to accelerate AI research is to improve the quality and diversity of environments in which to test algorithms,” Ilya Sutskever, the research director of OpenAI told Quartz in a statement. “Making StarCraft more widely available will aid the research community.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) Attention millennials, especially those living in cities. Don't panic if it comes down to late Tuesday afternoon. There are no excuses for not voting. Not work hours. Not weather. Not lack of wheels. Uber, Lyft, Google, Zipcar and Maven are offering special discounts or promotions to enable voters of all ages to get to their polling places on time. Uber and Google are offering an "in-app" feature that will help you locate your polling location and then seamlessly request a ride with just the push of a button. When you open the Uber app Tuesday, you'll see a reminder to get out and vote. ► Free Press poll: Donald Trump gains on Hillary Clinton as race in Michigan tightens Then by tapping the "Find Your Polling Place" button, which takes you a site with a Google-generated list of nearest polling stations. Next step: requesting a ride to get there. If you have managed to never take an Uber and will be requesting a ride for the first time, enter the code VOTETODAY to get $20 off. Lyft, in recognition that we are electing the nation's 45th president, will offer a 45% discount on one ride between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. for metro Detroit passengers. All Detroit Lyft users can access this promotion through the Deal of the Week e-mail they receive Sunday night. If you've never used Lyft before, just download the app and use the code NOVEMBER8TH to receive $5 off your first 10 rides. On the car-sharing front, Zipcar will make 74 cars available for free between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tuesday night.

NATION Harvard cancels men's soccer season for long-running practice of sexually ranking the women's team Kirkland House At Harvard University Bill Greene / Boston Globe A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. (Bill Greene / Boston Globe) Matt Pearce The evidence that would bring down the Harvard men’s soccer team was hiding in plain sight for years: publicly available emails, in the men’s own words, showing them sexually ranking new freshmen members of the 2012 women’s soccer team. “She looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated,” one of the men’s players wrote of a female in his eight-page “scouting report,” sent to his teammates, which assigned number rankings and potential sexual positions to the women. Of another player, he wrote: “She seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks.” Many of his comments are too crude to print, but they seemed to meet approval from his teammates: Of several who responded to the author’s “report,” one man wrote, “hahahahaha well done.” Worse still, the messages suggested that the “scouting report” wasn’t a one-time act of collective sexism, but a yearly ritual. Rolling Stone defamed University of Virginia administrator in rape story, jury finds Associated Press A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... (Associated Press) The messages had been publicly archived on a Google group-emailing service, Google Groups, and sat unnoticed for four years — until Harvard’s student newspaper, the Crimson, found and published the comments last week in a story that rocked one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions of higher learning. (The Crimson’s report did not identify the individual men behind the emails.) On Thursday, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise canceled the remainder of the men’s 2016 soccer season and banned them from post-season play, citing an investigation by the University’s Office of the General Counsel that turned up evidence of more recent “scouting reports” of the freshmen women. “Based on that review, I understand that this practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016, and that current students who participated were not immediately forthcoming about their involvement,” Scalise wrote in a message to Harvard’s athletes. Scalise said the department would work with the campus Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to educate the men’s soccer team and other athletic teams, adding that “Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” The 2016 men’s team apologized Friday in an open letter in the Crimson, saying that “no woman deserves to be treated in this manner.” “We accept responsibility for the mistakes and serious lapses in judgment that have led us here, and, in addition to accepting the sanctions from the Athletic Department, are shifting our focus toward the concrete actions we can take to address the fundamental issue of sexism in our community,” said the apology, which was attributed collectively to the team. A reporter for the Crimson, C. Ramsey Fahs, discovered the soccer team’s publicly available Google Group and the emails while “doing some digging on an entirely different issue,” the Crimson’s student president, Mariel Klein, told the Los Angeles Times. Members of the men’s soccer team changed the group’s settings to “private” after the Crimson contacted them for comment, said Klein, who called the crude report “a powerful document to see” in light of recent discussions on campus about sexism and sexual assault. Harvard President Drew Faust said she was “deeply distressed” to learn about the men’s behavior and supported the team’s suspension, adding, “The team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable.”  The postseason ban includes the Ivy League championship and the NCAA tournament, and the suspension ends a promising season. The men’s team had been leading the Ivy League standings and was ranked 15th nationally in the NCAA’s RPI ratings. “We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” men’s coach Pieter Lehrer said in a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times through the university. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.” Members of the women’s squad who had been featured in the 2012 report said they had initially brushed off the news but said the story became more unbearable after it picked up traction in the mainstream media, which they blamed for latching on to the story because of Harvard’s name. “The sad reality is that we have come to expect this kind of behavior from so many men, that it is so ‘normal’ to us we often decide it is not worth our time or effort to dwell on,” six women’s players wrote in an op-ed for the Crimson, expressing disappointment that “close friends” on the men’s team had been quietly carrying out the sexist practice. But the women asked the men and others to join them in hoping the story would lead to a more “productive conversation” on so-called “locker room talk” that extends far beyond the world’s locker rooms. “We are human beings, and we should be treated with dignity,” the women wrote. “We want your help in combating this. We need your help in preventing this. We cannot change the past, but we are asking you to help us now and in the future.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Nov 4th 2016, 9:35 PM 11,442 Views 59 Comments Share23 Tweet Email1 Image: Niall Carson/PA Wire GOOGLE FUNNELED MORE than €22.6 billion in sales from across Europe and other territories through its Irish subsidiary last year – a near-one-quarter increase on the 2014 tally. Newly filed accounts for the search giant’s local arm, Google Ireland, also show the company paid €47.8 million in corporate tax to the Exchequer after the vast majority of its profits were eaten away in assorted administrative expenses. The subsidiary recorded a gross profit of €17.1 billion for the year, up nearly 27% on the 2014 tally, but costs also rose as more money was transferred out in royalties to another, unspecified Google firm. The company’s net profit stood at €293.5 million. Google Ireland accounts for its US parent company’s sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as operating two data centres located in the Republic. The documents also show that the company directly employed 2,934 people at the end of 2015 – a 6% increase on the total workforce 12 months earlier. More than two-thirds of the workforce were employed in sales and marketing, with the remainder split between admin, engineering and operations roles. The accounts also note that the company spent €111 million on research, development and engineering during the year. Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Google Ireland head Ronan Harris Source: Sam Boal/RollingNews.ie A key driver In a statement, Google vice president Ronan Harris, who is moving from the Dublin office to London to oversee both the company’s UK and Irish operations, said the local operation was “recognised as a key driver of growth among our customers”. He said the company was also supporting the Irish startup community through projects like its Google for Entrepreneurs partnership with Dogpatch Labs. In addition to the 3,000-odd people the company employs directly, Harris said it also had “in the region” of 3,000 staff in contracted positions.

The fund invests in more mature and established companies with an eye towards helping portfolio companies accelerate their growth. CapitalG does not shy away from its close relationship with Alphabet’s main profit driver, “Our Google connection is our key asset.” Specifically, they cite the ability to “call on experts with deep knowledge from Google to help our portfolio companies.” Tactical advice is provided across key functional areas, including engineering, product, sales and marketing. Their site lists a bevy of top Googler’s including CEO Sundar Pichai, recently named VR business head Amit Singh, and other people from YouTube and Project Loon, with SVP and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond serving as the Chairman of CapitalG. The site also lists current CapitalG investments, like Airbnb and Duolingo. However, the Companies section also mentions a previously unknown investment in Snapchat. Business Insider has confirmed the investment in Snap Inc, renamed after the company announced Spectacles in September.

NATION Harvard cancels men's soccer season for long-running practice of sexually ranking the women's team Kirkland House At Harvard University Bill Greene / Boston Globe A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. (Bill Greene / Boston Globe) Matt Pearce The evidence that would bring down the Harvard men’s soccer team was hiding in plain sight for years: publicly available emails, in the men’s own words, showing them sexually ranking new freshmen members of the 2012 women’s soccer team. “She looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated,” one of the men’s players wrote of a female in his eight-page “scouting report,” sent to his teammates, which assigned number rankings and potential sexual positions to the women. Of another player, he wrote: “She seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks.” Many of his comments are too crude to print, but they seemed to meet approval from his teammates: Of several who responded to the author’s “report,” one man wrote, “hahahahaha well done.” Worse still, the messages suggested that the “scouting report” wasn’t a one-time act of collective sexism, but a yearly ritual. Rolling Stone defamed University of Virginia administrator in rape story, jury finds Associated Press A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... (Associated Press) The messages had been publicly archived on a Google group-emailing service, Google Groups, and sat unnoticed for four years — until Harvard’s student newspaper, the Crimson, found and published the comments last week in a story that rocked one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions of higher learning. (The Crimson’s report did not identify the individual men behind the emails.) On Thursday, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise canceled the remainder of the men’s 2016 soccer season and banned them from post-season play, citing an investigation by the University’s Office of the General Counsel that turned up evidence of more recent “scouting reports” of the freshmen women. “Based on that review, I understand that this practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016, and that current students who participated were not immediately forthcoming about their involvement,” Scalise wrote in a message to Harvard’s athletes. Scalise said the department would work with the campus Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to educate the men’s soccer team and other athletic teams, adding that “Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” The 2016 men’s team apologized Friday in an open letter in the Crimson, saying that “no woman deserves to be treated in this manner.” “We accept responsibility for the mistakes and serious lapses in judgment that have led us here, and, in addition to accepting the sanctions from the Athletic Department, are shifting our focus toward the concrete actions we can take to address the fundamental issue of sexism in our community,” said the apology, which was attributed collectively to the team. A reporter for the Crimson, C. Ramsey Fahs, discovered the soccer team’s publicly available Google Group and the emails while “doing some digging on an entirely different issue,” the Crimson’s student president, Mariel Klein, told the Los Angeles Times. Members of the men’s soccer team changed the group’s settings to “private” after the Crimson contacted them for comment, said Klein, who called the crude report “a powerful document to see” in light of recent discussions on campus about sexism and sexual assault. Harvard President Drew Faust said she was “deeply distressed” to learn about the men’s behavior and supported the team’s suspension, adding, “The team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable.”  The postseason ban includes the Ivy League championship and the NCAA tournament, and the suspension ends a promising season. The men’s team had been leading the Ivy League standings and was ranked 15th nationally in the NCAA’s RPI ratings. “We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” men’s coach Pieter Lehrer said in a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times through the university. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.” Members of the women’s squad who had been featured in the 2012 report said they had initially brushed off the news but said the story became more unbearable after it picked up traction in the mainstream media, which they blamed for latching on to the story because of Harvard’s name. “The sad reality is that we have come to expect this kind of behavior from so many men, that it is so ‘normal’ to us we often decide it is not worth our time or effort to dwell on,” six women’s players wrote in an op-ed for the Crimson, expressing disappointment that “close friends” on the men’s team had been quietly carrying out the sexist practice. But the women asked the men and others to join them in hoping the story would lead to a more “productive conversation” on so-called “locker room talk” that extends far beyond the world’s locker rooms. “We are human beings, and we should be treated with dignity,” the women wrote. “We want your help in combating this. We need your help in preventing this. We cannot change the past, but we are asking you to help us now and in the future.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Toggle Close Makeup Skin Hair Fashion Lifestyle Celebrity Best of Beauty Beauty Box Subscribe Newsletter Sign Up Makeup Skin Hair Fashion Lifestyle Celebrity Best of Beauty Beauty Box Follow magazinenewsletterSubscribe LifestyleTechnology 6 Ways Google Home Is a Beauty Guru’s BFF By Macaela Mackenzie and Seunghee Suhseungheesuh November 4, 2016 facebook dialog Pinterest facebook dialog Pinterest Email Courtesy of Google; Getty Images Lately it seems like the beauty industry has been taking all of its cues from Silicon Valley (see: extensive list of savvy beauty startups, high-tech skin and hair solutions, futuristic tools, and lust-worthy tech-meets-fashion/fitness/beauty collaborations). And thanks to this new tech wave, the truly savvy among us are learning to bring all kinds of consumer tech into the beauty game—the latest of which is a little gadget called Google Home. For the tech uninitiated among us, Google Home falls into a category of “smart speakers” (where it keeps company with Amazon Echo), but it’s basically an IRL version of Google’s search bar—sit the chic speaker on your dresser and you can ask it just about anything while your hands are busy with your a.m. beauty routine. Here are some ways you can use Google Home to reach peak tech and beauty guru status. 1. Get the latest news on product drops. The next time you’re running low on your Kylie Lip Kit supply, rather than launching into full-on panic mode, you can simply ask Google when you can expect the next drop. Then have good old Google Home verify your schedule so you can plan accordingly. 2. Find the best product dupes. The great thing about Google Home is that it’s pretty much a living version of the wealth of info Google has at its disposal. Searching for a good product dupe? Have your new BFF/beauty concierge do it for you rather than spending forever clicking around—that’s so twentieth century. The Easter eggs inside the "mind" of Google Home: 3. Factor the weather into your makeup routine. One of Google Home’s more basic features is that it can give you instant weather updates, which will totally come in handy when you’re getting ready in the morning. Raining? Reach for the waterproof mascara. Windy? Start working on an intentionally messy-chic braid. Just put in your home address (or wherever you're located) and ask a question: "OK, Google, is it going to rain today in New York?" we asked. Thankfully, Google answered no, so we slathered on sunscreen before greeting the sunny day. 4. Find the nearest beauty store. Google Home also has a whole world of directions programmed into its chic little brain. While Google can’t actually do your errands for you, it can tell you where to find a beauty store close to the office when you’re running low on essentials. To the question, "Where is the nearest Sephora?" Google Home spit out a list of locations. 5. Get the latest news on steals and sales. Google Home also doubles as your very own beauty news hound. Ask it if your favorite stores are having any sales before you make your weekend plans. 6. Keep a running list of beauty buys. If you’re anything like us, you have an endless and ever-evolving beauty wish list. Next time you hear about a new product you have to get your hands on, just have Google Home add it to your running list of must-haves. It's as simple as commanding, "Add perfume to my shopping list." The verdict: Google Home is a sleek, tiny speaker that will look great atop your vanity table—it looks like a chic air freshener, no? Designed with Google's new phone, the Pixel, in mind (though it works for iPhones and Androids), the product is great for tracking household tasks like shopping lists and keeping up with the weather. It's not perfect—you have to remember to ask each question with "OK, Google," though it can remember the context of your first question if you want to follow up with another query. For just $129, this little gadget would probably make a great holiday gift for the techie in your life.

AI can now see secrets through lipreading – kinda Siri, clone yourself and dive into this Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone UK AI ethics board to launch Vid Google DeepMind is partnering with Blizzard Entertainment, the producers of the hugely popular StarCraft game, to set the real-time strategy game as the next challenge in AI. The announcement was made during BlizzCon, a video games convention held by Blizzard Entertainment today, and comes right after researchers from Facebook and the University of Oxford published a paper with the same goal in mind. We're collaborating with @Blizzard_Ent to open up StarCraft II as an AI research environment for the global community in Q1 2017! pic.twitter.com/d2kIeV8mkv — DeepMind (@DeepMindAI) November 4, 2016 Google’s AI arm has been trying to crack general intelligence since it was founded in 2011, often through playing games. Under Demis Hassabis, who was a child prodigy in chess and previously an AI programmer for Lionhead Studios, a British video games developer, the company pursued Go. It made headlines this March when its AI software AlphaGo beat Go mastermind Lee Sedol. Now, DeepMind is making a beeline for StarCraft. Developers from DeepMind and Blizzard Entertainment’s StarCraft II team have been working on creating an API that supports “something similar to previous bots written with a 'scripted' interface, allowing programmatic control of individual units and access to the full game state,” DeepMind said in a blog post. The Starcraft DQN-powered AI bots will play directly from pixels; the team has created an image-based interface that allows the bot to make sense of its surroundings on the game map. The details of the game, such as unit type or unit health, will be monitored through separate “layers.” Below is a video showing off what players and bots can see. Youtube Video Not only has Blizzard made it simpler for researchers to build their bots, it’ll be easier to test them too, with something called “curriculum scenarios.” The scenarios are a series of tasks that get progressively harder for the AI gaming bot to complete, and they act as a “benchmark” for algorithms. More interestingly, researchers will also be able to create their own scenarios using the editing tools in StarCraft II. Many researchers recognize the potential of using games as a test bed for AI. Navigating virtual environments effectively could lead to potential applications in real life. It’s an area that DeepMind is also interested in, and it has attempted to apply simple AI software to robots. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI research director, welcomed using StarCraft II as a way for researchers to advance AI. “One of the best ways to accelerate AI research is to improve the quality and diversity of environments in which to test algorithms. Making StarCraft more widely available will aid the research community," Sutskever told The Register. “Solving the game requires computers to be able to plan ahead, deal with uncertainty and imagine possible outcomes – these are all open problems that OpenAI and other organizations are working on. We think surprising breakthroughs will happen as researchers can start testing their algorithms on new games." ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Blizzard blighted by another DDoS storm Someone likes fragging servers 9 Comments Blizzard shows off Overwatch – yet another guardians of Earth FPS Vids Once again the Americans mangle British accents 7 Comments Titan falls!

As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn’t take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn’t have to look outside of it. It was Apple’s dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got more and more panoramic — especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple’s competition — I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven’t been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future… Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn’t believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I’m still typing this very piece on, and again couldn’t help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear — and indeed, if you’re reading this piece right now, Apple’s efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I’m sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does — say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users’ complaints — more on that later — but I also try to fit into Apple’s shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they’ve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed — albeit expanding — portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac’s display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand’s — living in central London surely helps with this, but there’s no denying that the company’s reach is enviable, to say the least — and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn’t just boring by its own standards, but it’s being trumped by other companies too, big time — and often by names you most certainly wouldn’t expect. A few years ago — two and a half, to be exact — at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive’s introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive’s voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google’s ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple’s new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‘childish’ not because of its execution — an entirely different matter — but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile “cross war” between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is “never done”, but seeing where the company — and all of its products, starting with Android — was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words “Google Design” with “gorgeous”. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple’s services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable “wow” moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about — 3D Touch — is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I’ve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple’s stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question’s changed. Now it’s more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is “I don’t know”. It could perhaps be the 2015 12” MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to it, but even that would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‘forgettability’, in my view. It’s a product that hasn’t caught my attention at launch and that I still don’t see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn’t really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think “Yes, I need this” — or at least “I want this”. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an “s” model? Honestly, I don’t know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who’s actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes — the same Microsoft we’ve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky — and now dusty — black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple’s essential bequest of the “Pro” part to Microsoft. “These guys know productivity,” admitted Schiller last year. And it’s sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple’s keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple’s own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations — or, arguably, yet — but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn’t stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the “ultimate laptop” Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple’s latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it — the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It’s now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple’s altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a “pro” machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways — which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a “simpler” Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. “No, really, why would you buy one?” he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12” MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft’s ideas of a ‘tablet that can also be a laptop’ and a ‘laptop that can also be a tablet’ make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I’m not saying that they are necessarily better devices — that still largely depends on your preferences and needs — but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren’t the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home — and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don’t understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn’t be their main target anymore, but recent products — be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs — make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year’s major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that — and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can’t afford to battle only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

However, it seems that someone slipped up and started shipping the Daydream View VR headset to a few folks. The problem with this is that those users can’t use the new VR headset. Google will be releasing an accompanying application once the headset is made available to everyone later this month, but that application isn’t available on the Play Store as of yet. The app is called “Google VR Services” and the new Daydream headset can’t function without it, so if you’ve received your headset, you’re out of luck. For the rest of us who are waiting for our headsets to ship, we are expecting that to occur within the next week or two, so it’s likely the app will be released very soon. If you want to pre-order the Daydream View headset, you can still do so from Google, and the headset will be available for purchase from Best Buy, Verizon, and the Google Store for $79.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Analytics Firm Claims Pixel Adoption Rate Higher Than Nexus 6P Posted: Nov 4 2016, 12:47pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 5 2016, 11:32am CDT, in News | Technology News   Appboy   Seems like Google Pixel is doing well as compared to the Nexus 6P. The Pixel duo is the first series of home grown Smartphones by Google. Google previously collaborated with other device makers to create Nexus Phones. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals According to Appboy, Google has never pushed this much for a phone as it is doing for the Pixel phones. As per the firm this hard work is actually paying off. Coming to the statistics Google XL reached a market share comparable to that of Nexus 6P two weeks after launch. These numbers also include the stock shortages observed both at Verizon and Google stores. The Google XL doubled its launch day numbers in merely a week. Its percentage increase was 158%. Don’t underestimate the smaller Pixel. It is also showing amazing growth too. Just after a week of its launch its numbers increased by 274%. If we compare these results with the market leader Samsung, the S7 took a week extra to double its numbers. On the other hand its predecessor Galaxy S6 grew 171% in a week. The relative numbers indicate the Pixel is the winner. However the absolute number of the Samsung Galaxy S phones in the first week is far more than the Pixel. Pixel proves itself. The results are not at all bad for a new brand in this competitive Smartphone industry.   You May Like The Author Ahmed Humayun Ahmed Humayun is a technology journalist bringing you the hottest tech stories of the day.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News The Third-Party Apps That will Use MacBook’s Pro Touch Bar 8 hours ago Dell EMC unveils new IT products and solutions 9 hours ago Amazon Alexa Prize Competing Teams include Students from Berkeley, Princeton and Carnegie-Mellon 9 hours ago Technology and Fashion: Why Innovation Is a Must for Survival 10 hours ago Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 to support 28W 1 day ago, 10:06am CST Apple Pay Can Now Be Used for Donations 52 minutes ago Soyuz Spacecraft Arrives at Baikonur Launchpad ahead of ISS Mission 1 hour ago Macy's Black Friday 2016 Deals Previewed 4 hours ago U.S. Parents are Spanking their Kids Less Today, Study Finds 4 hours ago Hatchimals and NES Classic Stock Gone Online 4 hours ago Financial Phishing To Increase This Holiday Season 5 hours ago Jaguar's First All-Electric SUV I-Pace Revealing is Tomorrow 5 hours ago NextEV Previews its Hypercar Ahead of Next Week Debut 5 hours ago Facebook and Twitter Helped me Win Says Trump 5 hours ago Black Friday Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR Headset Deals Are Weak 5 hours ago Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News Black Friday Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR Headset Deals Are Weak Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   All Black Friday 2016 Deals on Samsung TVs Announced Sam's Club Samsung Saturday Sale on Nov. 19 Announced Technology News The Third-Party Apps That will Use MacBook’s Pro Touch Bar 8 hours ago Dell EMC unveils new IT products and solutions 9 hours ago Amazon Alexa Prize Competing Teams include Students from Berkeley, Princeton and Carnegie-Mellon 9 hours ago Technology and Fashion: Why Innovation Is a Must for Survival 10 hours ago More Technology News Stories Latest News Apple Pay Can Now Be Used for Donations 52 minutes ago Soyuz Spacecraft Arrives at Baikonur Launchpad ahead of ISS Mission 1 hour ago $299.99 50-inch Samsung UN50J5201AFXZA Smart TV Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deal 3 hours ago Macy's Black Friday 2016 Deals Previewed 4 hours ago More Latest News The Latest ...

X Surge in Google Ireland sales to €22bn offset as part of tax planning Sales up 23% while after-tax profits jump 72% as “Google Network” partners sign up Fri, Nov 4, 2016, 16:19 Mark Paul The number of staff directly employed by Google Ireland last year increased 6% to nearly 3,000. The company says it also employs about 3,000 contractors on its Irish sites.         Google Ireland, the Dublin-based hub through which the search engine diverts sales from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recorded a 23 per cent rise in revenues last year, to €22.6 billion. Newly filed accounts show its after-tax profit jumped 72 per cent to €293.6 million. Google Ireland paid €46.5 million in Irish corporation tax. Most of its extra €4.3 billion income, however, was wiped out by larger royalty payments to other parts of the Google empire abroad as part of the company’s extensive tax planning under so-called “transfer pricing” rules. In commentary attached to the accounts, Google said its “administrative expenses” rose by about €3.5 billion to €16.9 billion. It provided no further details on the make-up of these expenses, which do not incorporate revenue sharing arrangements with other web companies. Those are accounted for separately. Google attributed the rise in administrative expenses to “increased head count”, an “increase in sales and marketing effort”, and “an increase in the royalties paid to a group undertaking”. Fionnuala Meehan to replace Ronan Harris as Google head EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager Digital ad spending accelerates as mobile overtakes desktop Its average head count rose by about 250 employees and its total payroll cost €365 million, suggesting the bulk of the €16.9 billion in “administrative expenses” involved a cash royalty to another part of the group. Royalty location The company’s financial statements, which were filed on Friday afternoon, did not disclose the location of the entity to which the royalties were paid. It has been reported in previous years, however, that Google Ireland has paid royalties to an entity in the Netherlands as part of the “Double Irish” tax avoidance strategy, which is being phased out under new State rules. In previous years, the Dutch entity has moved these royalties on to other Google entities in tax-free offshore locations such as Bermuda. A spokesperson for Google Ireland said the increase in “administrative expenses is consistent with the increase in sales”. ADVERTISEMENT The number of staff directly employed by Google increased 6 per cent to nearly 3,000 by year’s end. It also employs about 3,000 contractors on its Irish sites, which include its two Dublin data centres and a sales hub in Dublin’s docklands. Ronan Harris, the outgoing head of its Irish operations, attributed the surge in sales to selling more ads to a greater number of members of the Google Network – other websites that direct search queries through Google’s website. “As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,” Mr Harris said. “In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750 million. “Dublin is recognised as a key driver of growth among our customers,” he added. “Last year, for example, we established the AppHub to help developers take advantage of the potential €60 billion European Union app economy.”       Topics: Ronan Harris Mark Paul Business Affairs European Union Google Africa Bermuda Dublin(IE) Europe Ireland Netherlands Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Greencore shares rise sharply on news of $746m acquisition in US Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain English Soccer Bastian Schweinsteiger begins talks over move to Chicago Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Investors focus on Trump’s infrastructure spending plans 23:07 Cantillon: To spend or not to spend – FF seem to want it both ways 19:49 Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry 19:25 Cantillon: Irish pension savers cautiously watch bond markets 19:18 Dermot Desmond-backed elearning firm sees 36% hike in profits 17:55 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Especially if you already use a lot of Google services, pitching $129 for a device that sits right between the Echo and Echo Dot in size might be a good choice for you. Now, the device is available for purchase from several retailers… Early this week, Google Home started popping up at Walmart stores, but even if you saw one, you probably weren’t going to be able to buy one until today. Our own Justin Duino saw one, actually, and after taking the device to the register was told that it shouldn’t have been on the shelves and that they weren’t allowed to sell it. That’s not the case anymore. As highlighted in a tweet sent out by Google this morning, you should be able to find a Google Home on the shelf (and actually be able to buy one) at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart for $129. You can also buy one outright from the Google Store with an estimated shipping dat of sometime around a week from now. If you haven’t already, be sure to read our review and check out our unboxing video. Voice-activated, hands-free help is here! #GoogleHome now at @BestBuy, @GoogleStore, @Target & @Walmart. https://t.co/chUICKoEEu pic.twitter.com/Sde4ok6EHU — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) November 4, 2016 Guides Google Home View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

By Brandon Vigliarolo | November 4, 2016, 11:50 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Jakub Jirsak Single sign on (SSO) services are definitely convenient: Think of all the apps on your mobile device that let you log in using your Google or Facebook accounts. Chances are there's quite a few—over 600 top ranked apps on Google Play use the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It's definitely convenient to skip account creation or signing in for every single app you install, but it's not without risks. In this case the risk is serious: 41.2% of the aforementioned 600 apps are putting users at risk to have their Facebook or Google accounts hijacked. More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter That's around 250 top apps, accounting for over one billion downloads on Android alone. Chances are good there's at least one on your device, and the flaw is platform agnostic. The cause of the vulnerability OAuth 2.0 works basically like this: A user inputs their SSO account details, and the app checks with Google or Facebook to see if that information is correct. Once the identity provider verifies the user gave correct info it sends back a login token, which the app then uses to sign the user in. SEE: Android Security Bulletin October 2016: What you need to know (TechRepublic) Over half of the apps are verifying the validity of the signature the Google or Facebook server sends back, but that 41% mentioned above isn't. When that's the case there's no way for the app to know if a username and password combination are legitimate. The discovery of this serious and widespread flaw is thanks to the work of three researchers at The Chinese University of Hong Kong: Ronghai Yang, Wing Cheong Lau, and Tianyu Liu. The research team set up a server to spoof logins by doing the following: A compromised app was installed on an Android device. An attacker signs into the app using their own legitimate Google or Facebook login. Using an ssl-enabled-MITM proxy the attacker substitutes their user ID with the victims after receiving authentication for their own login. The MITM proxy server forwards the modified login token to the app, and the attacker gains full access to the victim's profile. What's at risk The potential fallout from this exploit is huge. Many of the affected apps store user profile data in the cloud, and when a newly installed app is logged into, all the user's data is open for the taking. The paper, which you can read at Forbes, doesn't mention any affected apps, so we're left to speculate as to what could happen. Attackers could perform in-app purchases, book hotels, buy products—essentially any app you have installed that uses SSO could potentially be used against you. SEE: 10 do's and don'ts for securing your Android device (TechRepublic) The paper's authors did reveal one bright spot: They've notified Google, Facebook, and other identity providers of the exploit, and they're working to take action with third-party developers to plug the holes. With nearly 250 known affected apps that could take some time—perhaps it's a good idea to consider not using SSO for a while. The research team are presenting their findings today at Black Hat Europe. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Single sign on protocol OAuth 2.0, common on Android and iOS, has a flaw which allows attackers to hijack user accounts. The problem affects over 41 percent of mobile apps using OAuth 2.0. The exploit is caused by third-party apps not verifying the ID data being sent back from Google, Facebook, and other SSO ID providers. This allows attackers to substitute legitimate logins with other usernames and gain access to those accounts.

This can produce more interesting lessons than even digging into things like patents and whitepapers. For instance, I published a post last night, October 4th, 2016, on Context Vectors. On Twitter this morning, Dan Shure had a question about the snippet for my post, wondering why the snippet date was April 10, 2016. I knew the answer immediately. Dan’s Questioning Tweet: When I researched the post, and found the patent I wanted to write about, I used the WIPO Patentscope website to find the patent. I copied information from the WIPO pages, including the formatting of the Dates the patent was published and granted: I copied those dates into my post in exactly the same formatting found on the WIPO site DD/MM/YY instead of the way dates are formatted in the US MM/DD/YY: It appears that Google decided that it should take a lesson from the context of my blog post, and read the date of my post using DD/MM/YY instead of MM/DD/YY: Which answers the question that Dan asked about why Google decided that the date in the snippet should be April 10, 2016 instead of the date that it was actually published October 4, 2016. Google may have paid more attention to the context of date formatting than it possibly should have in that post. It does show that Google is paying attention to context, though. There were some others involved in a discussion of this anomaly this morning, and I wanted to give a shout-out to them for getting involved (thanks!): Aymen Loukil Steven Weldler Tylor Hermanson I’m not sure if it will help much, but I have changed the Formatting of the patent dates in the post about context vectors to the Americanized format of MM/DD/YY. Google is still showing a snippet date of April 10, 2016. Aymen Loukil suggested I try using DateTime Schema. It looks like that is aimed at providing information regarding sites that provide schedules, and Schema.org tells us that it is used on “Between 10 and 100 domains”. Nothing on that page seemed to explain how to explain the formatting used by Dates. Funny to learn about how Google might use context to format a snippet date based upon how the post the snippet is about may format dates within it. I decided to write about Dan’s question and its answer to keep it in mind and learn from it (I suspect we won’t see a patent just about how Google decides upon how to format dates in snippets. I’ve written some other posts about patents from the WIPO pages, and used the European formatting of dates from those. I should go back and look at the snippet dates Google may have given those… Facebook52 Twitter154 Google+15 LinkedIn105 Pinterest2 328shares Related Post navigation Previous PostGoogle Patents Context Vectors to Improve SearchNext PostKnowledge Panels in Site Audits 32 thoughts on “Learning SEO by Looking at Anomalies” Aaron Bradley says: 10/05/2016 at 11:39 am Hey Bill, FWIW I declare my blog posts to be of type schema.org/Article and then provide datePublished and dateModified in ISO 8601 date format (as per schema.org/Date). Google’s seems to understand this pretty well (though I’m not sure if it favors this structured data over in-post dates). Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:06 pm Hi Aaron, Thanks. I’m not sure I even thought about whether or not the formatting of the dates I included in my post from yesterday would influence the formatting of the snippet date that Google showed for my blog post. I have now learned that Google does pay attention to information like that, which is why I am sharing the information. We can see that Google may pay attention to the dates that are shown on a post, but might ignore the country of origin of the post when deciding upon the date format to use to interpret when those in-post dates actually refer to, if the post refers to dates that are formatted differently. I probably need to find other posts I’ve written that have included WIPO patent information, and see if the snippet dates showing for those also uses european formatting in snippets for those posts. If I had a site that published schedules for transit, I would probably want to find a way to format dates so that I was certain that Google understood the formatting I was using. Snippet dates, though? I wrote and published the post yesterday, which wasn’t April 10, 2016; I didn’t expect Google to change the date format that it had been using for most other posts on my site because I didn’t change the formatting of the dates I received from WIPO. Now I understand the risk of not doing so. 🙁 Maybe including the Structured Data information in addition to the in-post dates may be a good idea. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:39 pm Hi Aaron, Thinking about this again, I wonder if I had the right structured data, and included European formatted dates from WIPO in my post if Google would choose the formatting it sees in the post over the information it sees in structured data. I don’t know which it would choose. California is a long way from Europe, so I don’t know why they decided to use european formatting. Cliff Sarcona says: 10/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Question: What exactly does this say about Google’s ability to track content within context? Would you say it proves that contextual backlinks are given more weight then say a random link posted without any content, or a link thrown in a side bar? Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 4:06 pm Hi Cliff, Thank you for sharing your questions. This patent describes a process by which a search engine can better index content found on the Web and assign contextual meanings to terms or phrases or words based upon finding those in a knowledge base such as an online encyclopedia, and assign a weight to the term(s) based upon how often it shows up in such sources. The combination of the contextual meanings (from different subject matter domains) and weights applied to those meanings is referred to as a “Context Vector.” The patent isn’t about links or backlinks, and doesn’t refer to contextual backlinks at all, so comparing it to a random link or a link in a sidebar isn’t a consideration here at all. The idea behind this patent is to better index content found on the web, and to apply contexts to queries when searches are performed to make it more likely that a searcher finds what they are looking for. Viva Traffic says: 10/05/2016 at 4:55 pm Out of curiosity, does a post with earlier dates typically rank higher? For example, 2012 vs a 2016 post, will the 2016 post rank higher being that its newer information, or is that not factored in with seo? Rasmita Sahoo says: 10/06/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help a lot of beginners like me. Thanks Again. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 4:13 pm Hi Rasmita, You’re welcome. If you do see something odd in Google’s search results. and you can capture a screen shot of it, do so. And then ask about it, in places like Twitter. It is a good way to learn. Sometimes you can catch Google experimenting on something, and it’s good to see that happening, too. Andrew says: 10/08/2016 at 11:27 am Interesting to see how Google really drills down to content/context and not just url/title/description/H1. Really need to be on your toes while writing anything these days! Bill Slawski says: 10/08/2016 at 6:07 pm Hi Andrew, It is interesting seeing how Google can get a sense of the meanings of words on pages, and the context of those words. If what you write is about something, in a particular context, it should be easier for Google to find it. I’m liking the idea of context vectors.

I have seen him on Twitter, and I am going to have to hunt down things he has written about Schema. Thanks! Alnoor Verjee says: 10/24/2016 at 3:51 pm Hi Bill, quick question – do you think implementing a date time schema would help in ranking newer content in any way or is it just for context purposes? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:42 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think that a date/time schema would solve the problem I have with the format of the date the post was published being read wrong by Google. It probably doesn’t have any impact on the rankings of that page either. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:42 pm Hello Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help me a lot. Thanks you.

Cristina Sliva says: 11/10/2016 at 1:47 am Thanks for sharing this blog, This blog is very useful for everyone. keep it on. Flypa says: 11/10/2016 at 2:00 am Does that mean if I publish a post in 2013 and update it in 2016, will that post show up higher in search results? Great post once again. Thanks Bill Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:00 am Hi Flypa, No, changing the dates on post that you made shouldn’t have any effect on the rankings of those posts. However, if Google notices that a post you wrote in the past starts getting a lot of new links pointed to it, it might take those new links as a sign that people are interested in the content of your post, and might consider it timely or evergreen. Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:02 am Hi Cristina, Thank you for your kind words – Good hearing that people are getting value from my posts.

Since last winter, the Munich-based company has been powering Google hotel scores for search and maps where TrustYou finds a match between its hotel database and Google’s hotel database — that’s about 300,000 hotels. (When there isn’t a match, Google shows its Google Score.)* Update: Aug. 18: This article has been updated with corrections to some of the nuances of the TrustYou Stars platform and the Google partnership. A few quotes and the headline (“…and it isn’t afraid of TripAdvisor”) have been clarified to prevent a possibly misleading impression that TrustYou is competing with TripAdvisor when, in fact, it is a pure B2B play that styles itself “the Switzerland of reviews” and is a great partner with TripAdvisor when it comes to its reputation management software. TrustYou says that, for hotels that have begun to use its TrustYou Stars platform, which rolled out this year, on average, 75% of new hotel reviews on Google now come via the platform. The Stars tool expands the volume and reach of the hotel review data which can be seen on Google, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Wego. The company’s software also identifies review content from Expedia Inc and Priceline Group brands and analyzes that data, too. It mainly only excludes reviews from TripAdvisor, the user-reviews giant. Looking ahead, TrustYou thinks it can thrive, despite competition from rival reputation management companies, such as Revinate and ReviewPro, and guest survey companies like Medallia. Earlier this summer, TrustYou acquired Checkmate, a real-time messaging specialist for hotels to communicate with guests, for an undisclosed sum. We recently checked in with Benjamin Jost, chief executive and co-founder of TrustYou, to find out how his company plans to ride an expected wave of hotel investment in online reputation management. Jost outlined his belief that Google and other players will increasingly challenge TripAdvisor’s dominance in reviews. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Tnooz: Nothing personal, but hotel general managers, when they proverbially wake up at three o’clock in the morning, they’re worried about their TripAdvisor score, not their TrustYou score. Is TrustYou just never going to be able to compete with the giant that is TripAdvisor? Jost: TripAdvisor has built a great brand. No one competes with that overnight. With more and more eyeballs on our data, especially with the launch on Google, we do see more and more hotels caring about the TrustScore, too. I would say we just started with the past year, when the Google deal actually launched. Separately, we are great partners with TripAdvisor when it comes to our reputation management software, where we license their review data. We do show TripAdvisor ratings and reviews to hotels, because hotels NEED to see that and respond to that. Tnooz: Every hotel seems to have a sticker saying it is rated on TripAdvisor. TrustYou for years had has a quality symbol, but not as many hotels tell guests about that. Is TrustYou going to be stuck in second place next to TripAdvisor? Jost: No. As an analogy, take J.D. Power, which does customer satisfaction surveys in the States. It’s an example of where you have a third-party, non-competing brand, very popular amongst users because it’s trustworthy, and it becomes more and more popular. It’s not competing with anyone. We have a good chance of being a kind of J.D. Power for the travel industry. We’ve seen other industries have a player like that rise up. Why not in travel? TripAdvisor is, to a certain extent, at cross-purposes with the hotels in how it markets its metasearch tool and mobile app as a consumer entry point. I’m not judging. But because TrustYou is not competing for consumer attention, we’re a very, very easy choice for hotels… We can show that if you improve your score, you increase conversion on these metasearch sites. There’s a payoff to the investment. Plus, we offer a product tuned to hotel needs. To get technical, we give them control. A hotel can take our data and say, “I want to display my entire ranking relative to all hotels in my city. Or just based on the best-ranked family hotels. Or, I want to rank it on the best boutique hotels. Or I want a ranking on the hotels with the best bar.” We’re not competing with anyone… That’s a different positioning. Tnooz: How will the reputation management landscape look three or five years from now? Jost: Ideally, every hotel will use our services when it comes to guest feedback, for collecting and analyzing it. That means putting guest feedback on their own brand.com site and app, for instance, with our tools. Tnooz: The mix of unverified and verified reviews on TripAdvisor still seems to have the most power and momentum and scale. Jost: All this talk about verified, unverified…. It’s the user who will decide what kind of data point they trust or not. Apparently, they trust the TripAdvisor data point very much even though we, as the industry, say that some of those reviews are unverified. The user, for most of the part, doesn’t care. It’s less about the verified/unverified debate, and it’s more about who drives the booking…. Tnooz: You agree that hotels care more about TripAdvisor than Google these days, when it comes to reviews? Jost: That’s fair, yes. But that will change. My assumption is that Google is going to become a very dominant player that is going to provide a huge amount of leads throughout the funnel, be it directly to brand.com or through the intermediaries. It is going to be a central starting point in the travel journey, more and more. Google is in a great position because it never steals any SEO power from the hotels. The hotel can plug in the review content it has collected via the Stars platform, and that would never count as duplicate content, even though you would find the same review as a Google Review on Google. It’s an advantage because all the other players out there, they need this SEO power. They need the unique content piece. Everyone is competing against each other, and the only one who is really not competing in that game is Google, because they’re the entrance point of search and inspiration. We also don’t compete with anyone because we don’t need to. We are a pure B2B play. We are the Switzerland of review analysis and reputation management. Tnooz: You seem to be saying there’s going to be a tipping point where hotels will realize your TrustScore has a huge impact. Jost: Yes, but more broadly… Despite your questions, I’m not so worried about when we’ll surpass TripAdvisor. Your framing is wrong: It’s not a zero-sum game. For one reason, using our platform to improve your scores on non-TripAdvisor ratings will usually also help your TripAdvisor ones, too. It’s simple logic. If a service improvement helps raise your TrustYou scores, it will logically also help your TripAdvisor rating, too. We’re going to have a huge impact on the TripAdvisor score indirectly because we can still tell you, “Hey, fix your cold coffee problem that you have in your breakfast room because people are complaining about it.” Once you fix it, you are going to see an increase in your scores across the board. One other thing: We do let a hotel analyze the TripAdvisor channel through our analytics. We just don’t take that channel’s reviews into account when we calculate our review summaries. Hotel marketers will recognize us as a force that drives booking on scale. If they don’t recognize us today, they will. If you count all of them together, Kayak, Google, Skyscanner — how many eyeballs do we have on our data? We may have more eyeballs on our data soon than are on TripAdvisor’s. Our winning model is our focus on B2B, on helping the hotel figure out the most effective ways to improve their product. Tnooz: Thanks. Different topic, please. Why acquire Checkmate? Jost: We wanted to be everywhere on the traveler journey when it comes to guest feedback…. Collecting information from the guest via mobile devices as the guest is about to arrive and during their stay was the last piece of the journey we didn’t haven’t well covered. Tnooz: If Checkmate was so great, why did it have to be a distressed asset sale? Meaning, why is this a good acquisition for you? Jost: I can answer generally. Take Expedia. It was an investor in Checkmate, and in Alice, another messaging service. That shows that this segment is still very hot and is at the very beginning. Tnooz: Why will one solution win and another won’t? Jost: It’s going to boil down to execution. How do you build a sales force and execute on marketing effectively. We have at least a good head start in that because we’ve done that sales and marketing work already for other services and we can now plug in this product to all of our customers. We’ve received a lot of positive reaction when we told our customers we’re adding this messaging tech…. You see all these technology stack players. They build a management tool and they want to add a CRM on top and they build some other BI on top and they want to sell this entire technology stack to hotels. We only want to focus on guest feedback….It’s a clearer sales pitch. Tnooz: Isn’t it hard to scale up with independent hotels, with lots of small, one-off deals? Jost: Yes, it’s probably much harder to sell to an independent hotel because the sales cost is higher compared to, “Hey, I just signed Accor,” and 4,000 sales come on board immediately. We don’t have a particularly pure independent sales strategy. We don’t have a particularly pure enterprise sales strategy. We see both as important. With independent hotels, you have to be very effective in your sales approach there, and you have to measure really well how it works. That’s what we’ve been doing. Our team knows today how it works. We know the metrics. We know the funnel. Now we can start to scale that business in the independent hotel sector. Tnooz: How big is your client list? Jost: These numbers everyone is throwing around … Everyone’s saying, “Ah, we’re 50,000 properties. We’re 30,000 properties.” Whatever. I would always say, it depends how you look at it. We are less reliant on a few large chain deals than some competitors. When we say 50,000 hotels worldwide use us for one of our services, we mean we have some of these hotels looking at our data through different portals. We have a lot of hotels looking at our dashboards within a third-party tool or an extranet. For example, we help power the reputation tools on HRS and HolidayCheck. By the end of this year, we have a goal of having specifically 20,000 hotels that feed their own reviews into TrustYou’s guest feedback platform. We will also announce a couple of partnerships with bigger providers that build websites for hotels and that need content to help power brand.com websites or PMS players or CRM players that sit on the guest profile data. We may give them our Stars platform, our feedback platform, for all their hotels for free, so they can start collecting feedback and push it into the guest feedback platform with TrustYou. That’s good for scale. Tnooz: Could you tell us more about TrustYou Stars, your big product push of the year? Jost: Some context, first: We look at all reviews as guest feedback. Whether it is on an OTA or a review site or it is posts and comments on social, it’s guest feedback. We call it surveys when we look at operational procedures of the hotel. But it’s all guest feedback. Why do you want to look at this data feedback in different silos, as some competitor tools do? Why do you want a platform to look at social feedback, but not surveys. Why don’t you want to look at this all together because it’s all together guest feedback? We still let you slice and dice the information to compare and see trends. But we stand out for bringing all the feedback together in the single TrustYou Stars platform. We compete with Medallia, and we’re leaving it behind as the dinosaur in the industry when it comes to guest feedback operations. In 2015, we replaced Medallia for the entire Accor group for all their almost 4,000 hotels. We’ll continue to win big chains because, among other reasons, the TrustYou Stars platform has a sophisticated post-stay survey component. We say, “Hey, if you, at the end of your survey, as a traveler, you get to choose, do you want to push this review or this survey into Google as well and share it with all the other fellow travelers out there? Yes or No?” The traveler has the choice to say, “Yes, I want to share it.” If they say yes, we push it out on Google as a Google Review. This process is unleashing a huge force on behalf of hotels. About half of hotel guest feedback is hidden right now in some guest survey databases not accessible to the web. We say to them, Why don’t you make it public and we take it into account when we calculate your score? Suddenly they can do this, and they make the guest feedback public. It makes for a fuller picture of the stay experience. Now, especially after we fully integrate Checkmate, we’re everywhere guest feedback happens. In the search process, on the intermediary or on the brand.com site, on an app during a stay, and on the post-stay survey or on one of the review channels or be it on their own survey channel or an OTA’s. Our data is responsible for guiding booking decisions. Hotels are noticing.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. One of the limitations of information on the Web is that it is organized differently at each site on the Web. As a newly granted Google patent notes, there is no official catalog of information available on the internet, and each site has its own organizational system. Search engines exist to index information, but they have issues, as described in this new patent that make finding information challenging. Limitations on Conventional Keyword-Based Search Engines The patent granted to Google, in September of 2016, discusses a way to organize information on the Web in a manner which can help to better organize and index that information, using context vectors to better understand how words are being used. The patent describes limitations of search engines that are based upon indexing content using keywords, such as: A search engine working with Conventional keyword searching will return all instances of the keyword being searched for, regardless of how that word is used on a site. This can be a lot of results Conventional search engines may only return only the home page of a site that contains the keyword. Finding where the keyword is used on the site could be difficult Often a conventional search engine will return a list of URLs in response to a keyword search that may be difficult to modify or search further in a meaningful manner. Information obtained through a search can become dated quickly. Such information may need to be checked up upon The patent tells us about those limitations and also points out some of the limitations of directories that could also be used to help find information. It then goes on to provide a possible solution to this problem, with a “data extraction tool” capable of providing many of the benefits of both search engines and directories, without the drawbacks that this patent points out. Is this The Google Search Engine with RankBrain Inside? A search engine based on a data extraction tool like the one described in the patent would be an improvement over most search engines. Is this Google’s search engine with RankBrain applied to it? It’s possible that it is, though it doesn’t use the word RankBrain The Bloomberg introduction to RankBrain, Google Turning Its Lucrative Web Search Over to AI Machines provides information about the algorithm used in RankBrain, and it tells us: RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities — called vectors — that the computer can understand. This new patent refers to what it calls Context Vectors to index content about words found on the Web. To put it clearly, the patent tells us: In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When a search submits a query to a search engine, we are told that the search engine may try to give it contexts based upon “other queries from the same user, the query associated with other information or query results from the same use, or other inputs related to that user to give it more context. The patent is: User-context-based search engine Inventors: David C. Taylor Application Date: 09/04/2012 Grant Number: 09449105 Grant Date: 09/20/2016 Abstract: A method and apparatus for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When RankBrain was first announced, I found a patent that was co-invented by one of the members of the team that was working on it, that described how Google might provide substitutions for some query terms, based upon an understanding of the context of those terms and the other words used in a query. I wrote about that patent in the post, Investigating Google RankBrain and Query Term Substitutions. I think reading the patent that post is about, and the one that this post is about can be helpful in understanding some of the ideas behind a process such as RankBrain. This patent does provide a lot of insights in explaining the importance of context and how helpful that can be to a system that may be attempting to extract data from a source and index that data in a way which makes it easier to locate. I liked this passage in particular: Interestingly, some words in the English language, and other languages pertain to many different areas of subject matter. Thus, one may think of the universe of communication as containing numerous domains of subject matter. For example, the various domains in FIG. 2 refer to centers of meaning or subject matter areas. These domains are represented as somewhat indistinct clouds, in that they may accumulate a vocabulary of communication elements about them that pertain to them or that relate to them. Nevertheless, some of those same communication elements may also have application elsewhere. For example, a horse to a rancher is an animal. A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. Thus, the communication element that we call “horse” belongs to, or pertains to, multiple domains. A search engine that can identify the domains or contexts that a word might fit within may be able to better index such words; as described in this patent: In an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, a search engine process is developed that provides a deterministic method for establishing context for the communication elements submitted in a query. Thus, it is possible for a search engine now to determine to which domain or domains a communication element is “attracted.” Since few things are absolute, domains may actually overlap or be very close such that they man share certain communication elements. That is, communication elements do not “belong” to any domain, they are attracted to or have an affinity for various domains, and may have differing degrees of affinity for differing domains. One may think of this affinity as perhaps a goodness of fit or a best alignment or quality alignment with the subject matter of a particular domain. Contextually Rewarding Search Results The patent tells us that a search engine that works well is one that provides a searcher with information in response to a query that is “comparatively close related”. Information that is exactly what has been sought. Then information that is close to what has been sought and is still useful. Then it tells us that what would be “contextually unrewarding” would be information that shares the word in a completely different and useless context related to the query Words might be related to a wide range of particular fields or subject matter domains. The patent describes how these might be used: Typically, a domain list of about 40 to 50 terms have been found to be effective. Some domain lists have been operated successfully in an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention with as few as 10 terms. Some domain lists may contain a few hundreds of individual terms. For example, some domains may justify about 300 terms. Although the method is deterministic, rather than statistical, it is helpful to have about 40 to 50 terms in the domain list in order to improve the efficiency of the calculations and determinations of the method. The domain lists have utility in quickly identifying the particular domain to which their members pertain. This results from the lack of commonality of the terms and the lack of ambiguity as to domains to which they may have utility. By the same token, a list as small as the domain lists are necessarily limited when considering the overall vocabulary of communication elements available in any language. Thus, the terms in domain lists do not necessarily arise with the frequency that is most useful for rapid searching. That is, a word that is unique to a particular subject matter domain, but infrequently used, may not arise in very many queries submitted to a search engine. A process for creating a vocabulary list of a substantial universe or a substantial portion of a universe of communication elements may be performed by identifying a body or corpus of information organized by topical entries. Thereafter, the text of each of those entries identified may be subjected to a counting process in which occurrences of terms from the domain list occur within each of the topical entries. Ultimately, a calculation of a macro context may be made for each of the topical entries. This calculation is based on the domain lists, and the domains represented thereby. This is where this patent enters into the world of the Semantic Web. The places where different subject matter domains may be identified for different words could be in knowledge bases or online encyclopedias. Such collections of what is referred to as public knowledge might be called a “corpus”. This kind of corpus of information could be used to create a context vector used to index different meanings of words. When a different meaning is found, it might then be counted from that information corpus The patent tells us that terms found in such a place could be “individual words, terms, expressions, phrases, and so forth.” The patent attempts to put this into context for us with this statement: One may think of a topical entry as a vocabulary term. That is, every topical entry is a vocabulary word, expression, place, person, etc. that will be added to the overall vocabulary. That is, for example, the universe may be divided into about 100 to 120 domains for convenient navigation. Likewise, the domain lists may themselves contain from about 10 to about 300 select terms each. By contrast, the topical entries that may be included in the build of a vocabulary list may include the number of terms one would find in a dictionary such as 300 to 800,000. Less may be used, and conceivably more. Nevertheless, unabridged dictionaries and encyclopedias typically have on this order of numbers of entries. Contexts as Vectors When RankBrain first came out, there was a post published that looked at some information that might make it a little more understandable; it included some information about Geoffrey Hinton’s Thought Vectors, and there’s more about those in this post from Jennifer Slegg: RankBrain: Everything We Know About Google’s AI Algorithm. There is a Google Open Source Blog post on Word Vectors which is closely related, titled Learning the meaning behind words, written by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, and Quoc Le. Ilya Sutskever was a student of Geoffry Hinton. Tomas Mikolov worked on a number of papers about word vectors while with the Google Brain team, including Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space. The patent spends a fair amount of time describing what it considers context vectors to be; the different domains which a word might fall into, and number of occurrences or weights for those words within those domains. It’s worth drilling down into the patent and reading about how terms can be considered context vectors that a search engine might label them as. When a searcher enters a query into a search engine to be searched, the query may be classified within contexts, to help in selecting information in response to that query. Using a Browser Helper Object The patent describes how it might identify different domains that might be associated with specific terms. It tells us that this might be done: By compiling a list of domain-specific questions, it is possible to (1) specify differences between very similar domains with great precision, and (2) create a rapid way to prototype a domain that does not require many hours of an expert’s time, and can be expanded by relatively inexperienced people. The patent also describes the use of a BHO (Browser Helper Object) in this manner: Another slightly more complex implementation is something like a Browser Helper Object (BHO) that runs on the user’s machine and watches/categorizes all surfing activity. With this system, even non-participating sites can contribute to the picture of the user, and any clicking the user does to ad sites served by certified clicks will pick up a much more comprehensive picture. The patent provides more details on how this contextual vector based system might work, and how data might be extracted from web pages. It is highly recommended reading if you want to get a better sense of how a context-based system might be used to index the web and to make specific information on the Web easier to improve upon most conventional keyword-based search engines.

Butler says: 10/05/2016 at 3:35 am The article is very interesting. They are starting to think more effectively about the process of understanding. Note; however, that they do not (and cannot) define context precisely. I am able to do this. It will be in my next post on Constants, Variances, and Identities. Note also how Google is also trying to set the precedent for patenting knowledge. This route will lead further to its own demise. This is wrong ethically, morally, and legally as well.﻿ Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 7:44 am Hi Carey, Thank you. It’s interesting seeing what Google is trying to do with the processes they’ve come up with to drive search. Trying to account for contexts seems to make sense. We’ll see where Google tries to take this next. Adam says: 10/05/2016 at 8:57 am Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! I am not sure which one I prefer? 😉 Derek says: 10/05/2016 at 10:20 am Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. I thought the BHO component and its role in disambiguation was one of the most interesting parts of the patent. It reflects how critical browser and email market share are to Google’s core search business, especially since that user data is proprietary and unavailable to competing search engines. It also justifies Google’s continued investment in other freeware like Sheets and Docs—anything that yields a logged-in user improves Google’s chances of returning a better result than Bing or DuckDuckGo. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:18 am Hi Adam, If you write about a topic, and provide enough facts and details so that a search engine can get a good sense of what your page is about (because it understands the context of your page) , I think that is an improvement over keyword stuffing or string matching of query terms with document terms. It’s good seeing Google making these kind of steps. Also good seeing that they are learning context from places such as knowledgebases, which makes indexing the web more about knowledge graphs. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:23 am Hi Derek, Thank you! The Browser Helper Object was interesting and definitely tied into presenting this approach as a data extraction tool approach. Learning from the context of a searcher’s query may be improved by understanding the search history, prior searches, and web page visits of searchers. A searcher’s use of things like Google+ can also provide helpful information about searchers to put the context of a search into better perspective as well. Robert says: 10/05/2016 at 11:51 pm The Browser Helper Object seems to be the logical continuation from using other factors such as search history or even click through rates. This would seem to be a kind of reverse engineering where Google would be able to now get a better idea of what you’re not doing? As in elements that aren’t drawing your interaction and as such determine that they aren’t a good match. An example of: sometimes knowing what doesn’t work is in itself knowledge of something. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 8:39 am Hi Robert, I think the BHO described in the patent would give Google a better idea of what you are doing, rather than what you aren’t doing. Riya Sharma says: 10/26/2016 at 11:25 pm Interesting…. Good to know that Google is not just keep sitting at its legacy Thanks for sharing such a informative article…. fernanda says: 11/02/2016 at 11:51 am It´s Nice. Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:31 am Thanks, Fernanda. It does make searches smarter by better understanding the meanings of words based upon their context. Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:33 am Thank you Riya, I was happy when I found this patent and read through it, because it does describe an interesting approach from Google.

Sprint users with Android devices are in for a texting upgrade. Google on Friday announced that it's teaming up with Sprint to launch Rich Communications Services messaging to the carrier's customers using Android devices, starting today. RCS promises features like group chat, high-resolution photo sharing, read receipts, and advanced calling. This move makes Sprint the first carrier to support the new messaging experience. Sprint customers can check out the new features inside the Google-developed Messenger app for Android devices. Those using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint don't have to do anything to get the update: it will be pushed to handsets automatically. Subscribers using other Android devices can download Messenger from the Play Store. //Related Articles Google, Global Carriers Team Up to Improve Text Messaging Next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android preloaded as the default texting app. "We're excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the US," Google's Head of Rich Communication Services, Amir Sarhangi, wrote in a blog post. "We look forward to launching RCS with more partners in the coming months." At this point, more than 58 carriers and manufacturers covering 4.7 billion people around the world have committed to supporting a "single, standard implementation of RCS," Sarhangi added. Besides Sprint, that list includes América Móvil, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Globe Telecom, KPN, Millicom, MTN, Orange, PLAY, Smart Communications, Telenor Group, TeliaSonera, Telstra, TIM, Turkcell, VimpelCom, and Vodafone.

Welcome to Wyandotte Daily! Serving Kansas City (Wyandotte County) Kansas for over 45 years! News Weather Sports Sporting KC T-Bones Business About Wyandotte Daily Communities Wyandotte County Kansas City Kansas Piper Bonner Springs Leavenworth Overland Park Kansas City Missouri Opinions Calendar Events Faith Employment NewzAdz Internet comes to KCK public housing November 4, 2016 Mary Rupert Communities, Kansas City Kansas, News 0 Residents of the Cyrus K. Holliday public housing complex in Kansas City, Kan., got more information about the Internet and signed up for service at an event on Wednesday. (Staff photo) by Mary Rupert Spanning the digital divide takes the effort of more than one group in Wyandotte County. On Wednesday, residents of a public housing complex in Kansas City, Kan., signed up for Internet service with help from Google Fiber, Connecting for Good and the Surplus Exchange. One resident of the Cyrus K. Holliday public housing complex at 1750 S. 37th Court in Kansas City, Kan., who signed up for the Internet on Wednesday said it will be very helpful for the children to do their homework at home. Sometimes their homework involves accessing the Internet, she said. Rachel Merlo, Google Fiber community impact manager, said Google Fiber has worked with the Kansas City, Kan., Public Housing Authority to identify families with kindergarten through 12th grade children to help them close the homework gap – where they don’t have access to the Internet at home. Rachel Merlo, Google Fiber community impact manager, said this is an effort to help families with kindergarten through 12th grade children help close the homework gap. (Staff photo) At the same time, there are benefits for adults, such as access to job postings, Merlo said. In serving similar communities in Kansas City, Mo., since February, they have already seen residents using the Internet to find a job, to find a car to go to the job, and to make child care arrangements, Merlo said. One resident is now going to school and will be able to use the Internet in her adult education, Merlo said. Some residents are just figuring out how to use computers and the Internet to stay in touch with friends and family, and some have tried video conferencing. While many families already have a smart phone, this program is partnering with nonprofit organizations to bring low-cost, refurbished devices such as a laptop or desktop computer to do some of the more highly involved tasks, such as a job search, Merlo said. The organizations also provide them with free training. Merlo said she would love to see all the residents of the 60 units in the Cyrus Holliday complex sign up for the free service. Often there is a lot of excitement at the beginning for the service, then followed by more signups later. There sometimes is skepticism from people who wonder if it is really free and think that they might be billed later, so she said Google and the organizations work to build trust in the community. Merlo said two more Housing Authority properties, including Chalet Manor, will come on line this year. There are plans to connect a total of seven Housing Authority sites in Kansas City, Kan., eventually, according to Connecting for Good. Tom Esselman, CEO of Connecting for Good, said a combination of available Internet connectivity, computer devices and training were offered at the housing site on Wednesday. All three have to go together for people to improve their lives through the technology, he said. Connecting for Good tries to take the emphasis away from the technology and more toward life improvement, he said. Esselman said the organization helps with education skills, career skills and life skills. “So much of our world is digitalized any more, that for people who live in low-income diverse areas, many of them have not even had access to those skills,” he said. “Now that they have the access, we want to make sure that they are able to take advantage of them,” he said. Connecting for Good provides free training classes, he said, and it provides some used computers and equipment on a smaller scale. Surplus Exchange does recycling of computers on a larger scale, he added. In Wyandotte County, Connecting for Good works with Workforce Partners, he said. Connecting for Good trains people on how to refurbish and work with computers. Interns refurbish computers, then the computers are made available to That allows the organization to make computers available for $50 or $75, prices that some low-income people can afford, he said. The organization has been doing this program for four years, he added. “People get more use out of equipment that they have had to pay money for,” he said. “They feel that they have bought into it.” It also helps Connecting for Good, a small not-for-profit, offset some of its costs, he added. “We partner in every Housing Authority site,” Esselman said. Google Fiber provides the connectivity, Surplus Exchange provides the hardware, with some help from Connecting for Good, and Connecting for Good provides the training, he added. The Kansas City, Kan., Housing Authority is also a partner, has provided a location for Connecting for Good at Juniper Gardens, and supports the ability of these organizations to do the work, he added. “It opens up whole new worlds for them,” Esselman said.

SUBSCRIBE Google begins mobile-first indexing, using mobile content for all search rankings While called an 'experiment,' it’s actually the first move in Google's planned shift to looking primarily at mobile content, rather than desktop, when deciding how to rank results. Barry Schwartz on November 4, 2016 at 12:00 pm More Kashin / Shutterstock.com Google has begun testing its mobile-first index, which will primarily look at the mobile version of your website for its ranking signals and fall back on the desktop version when there is no mobile version. We expected this was coming and even heard about it over a year ago, but this is the first time Google has posted details about the mobile-first index on their own blog. Most of Google searches are mobile, but Google’s index is desktop Google explained that it sees more mobile searches than desktop searches on a daily basis. But when Google looks to evaluate a page’s ranking in Google, it currently looks at the desktop version of the site — an issue we pointed out over a year ago. To fix this, Google will look at the content, links and structured data of the mobile version of your site if one is available. Google wrote: To make our results more useful, we’ve begun experiments to make our index mobile-first. Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results. Of course, while our index will be built from mobile documents, we’re going to continue to build a great search experience for all users, whether they come from mobile or desktop devices. With this change, Google will primarily index mobile content and use that to decide how to rank its results, regardless of whether you’re on desktop or mobile. There will no longer be any type of “mobile-friendly” adjustment done just for mobile users. Effectively, if you’re not mobile-friendly, that will have an impact even on how you appear for desktop searchers Google is testing this but hopes to roll it out to all Google said it has started this experiment and will “continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale.” Google will “ramp up this change when we’re confident that we have a great user experience.” No mobile site? Don’t worry Those who do not have a mobile version of their website do not need to worry. Google will just use the desktop version to rank the site. Google wrote, “[I]f you only have a desktop site, we’ll continue to index your desktop site just fine, even if we’re using a mobile user agent to view your site.” This also means that if you have a responsive site, one that dynamically changes content depending on desktop or mobile device, there’s nothing special you need to do. Of course, if you do not have a mobile site, you won’t benefit from the mobile-friendly ranking boost. But that is separate from this mobile index news. How can you prepare? Here are some recommendations Google is giving webmasters to prepare for the change: If you have a responsive site or a dynamic serving site where the primary content and markup is equivalent across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site configuration where the primary content and markup is different across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version. Sites can verify the equivalence of their structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output. When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links; we’ll continue to use these links as guides to serve the appropriate results to a user searching on desktop or mobile. If you are a site owner who has only verified your desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version. We will keep you posted As we see changes to the Google results and index, we will report back to you with any issues. When this mobile-first index fully rolls out, we will let you all know.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Amazon India's most attractive Internet brand: TRA study Press Trust of India | New Delhi Nov 04, 2016 10:07 PM IST US-based online retailer Amazon has been ranked as the most attractive Internet brand in the country ahead of rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal as well as search engine giant Google, according to India's Most Attractive Brands Study 2016. "For the first time in three years, Amazon has been declared as the most attractive Internet brand (96th rank overall)...," said the study carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA). Google emerged as the second-most attractive Internet brand in the country while its overall ranking was 102. The study was based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. Flipkart grabbed the third position in the Internet category, jumping 221 slots to 125th rank across India, while Snapdeal saw an improvement of 63 ranks to 302nd on the list. Social networking giant Facebook rose 202 ranks in the national rankings to 157th position in 2016, and was placed fourth in the category, the study said. "The Internet category has seen a surprising shift in the top ranks, with Amazon ranking higher than Google, implying a serious improvement in the appeal of conducting transactions online," TRA Chief Executive Officer N Chandramouli said. This is apparent from the fact that out of the 29 brands listed in the Internet category in 2016, 11 brands were online retailers, he added. "Expected brands like Shopclues (461 rank) and Uber (483) were listed in the Internet category along with some surprising entrants like Koovs (477), Voonik (937) and Oyo Rooms (948)," he said. The list was topped by Korean electronics giant LG while the Tata conglomerate slipped in ranking to the seventh spot this year (from 5 in 2014 and 4 in 2015).

It paid tax of €47.8m. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Simon Bowers @sbowers00 Friday 4 November 2016 15.18 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.22 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Google’s controversial advertising sales business in Dublin earned revenues of €22.6bn (£20.1bn) from Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year but paid just €47.8m in tax, according to company filings in Ireland. Revenues at Google Ireland Limited rose 23% in 2015, to €22.6bn, and were equivalent to a third of the search group’s global income. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (£5.6bn) is thought to have come from transactions with advertisers in the UK. Google has continued to route its sales from British advertisers through Ireland, despite efforts by the former UK chancellor George Osborne to crack down on multinational tech groups that “abused the trust of the British people”. Google Ireland Limited is one half of the search group’s so-called “double Irish” tax structure. Although Google reported booming revenues, its taxable profits were only €341m. This profit figure was small in large part because the company had to meet administrative expenses of €16.9bn. These expenses are thought to be dominated by royalty fees paid to other Google subsidiaries – income which eventually makes its way to a business called Google Holdings Ireland, the second company in Google’s “double Irish” structure. European commission to resurrect overarching corporate tax proposals Read more Almost no information is made public about Google Holdings Ireland, which is an unlimited company. It is registered to the address of a law firm in Dublin, but is thought to pay no tax in Ireland as it is tax-resident in Bermuda. Because it is unlimited, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. However, Bermuda does not charge corporation tax, so the billions of dollars of income Google is able to move into Google Holdings Ireland each year go untaxed. Google has told investors that, at the end of last year, it had amassed an offshore cash pile of $42.9bn. Other US tech companies that have made use of “double Irish” tax avoidance structures include Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. Under pressure from world leaders, Ireland agreed two years ago to start phasing out the tax benefits of such structures. However, Irish ministers have awarded generous “grandfathering rights” which ensure Google and others are able to pour income into their offshore tax havens up until 2020. Google, which is ultimately owned by the holding company Alphabet Inc, insists it’s business in Ireland are much more than a tax structure. At the end of last year, Google Ireland Limited employed 2,763 staff, an increase of 6% in 12 months. “As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,” said Ronan Harris, who is shortly moving from Ireland to lead Google operations in the UK. “In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750m.” Ahead of the UK election in 2015, George Osborne promised to stop tech firms routing sales from customers in Britain to gateway jurisdictions, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, from where income can then be easily transferred to offshore tax havens. As UK chancellor, Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, which he said would hit companies found to be artificially shifting UK income overseas. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their ways, others – including Google and eBay – have continued to book UK sales overseas. In January, UK tax inspectors reached a £130m tax settlement with Google over taxes stretching back 10 years. Osborne initially heralded as a “major success”, though many others condemned it as too lenient. Separately, Google has promised significant investment in the UK, which some tax campaigners fear may have been a factor in the minds of those at HMRC reaching the settlement. A more serious challenge to the “double Irish” tax avoidance method – or at least the most significant instance of it – came from European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. In August she ruled that Apple’s long-standing tax arrangements in Ireland relied on illegal state aid. As a result, the Irish government would have to collect €13bn in back taxes from the iPhone maker, she said.

DESIGN Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Slack Designers Explain the Art of Creating Smart A.I. Bots Here's how artificial intelligence should look and behave, according to leaders in the tech industry. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT Google's Pixel phone, which includes Google Assistant. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Siri--and all her artificially intelligent peers--are increasingly taking on more tasks for people at home and at work. But as impressive as these digital assistants can be, they're still very much in their infancy. "I don't think anyone has nailed the user experience yet," warns Jason Cornwell, who leads the team at Google tasked with designing exactly that. Still, the biggest players in artificial intelligence (A.I.) agree on some important design lessons. Cornwell shared a stage with execs from Slack, Facebook, and Microsoft on Thursday at Fast Company's Innovation Festival in New York City. The group discussed what each respective company has learned about what works--and what doesn't--when building consumer-focused, A.I.-based products. Here's what the panelists had to say: 1. A.I. should add to the conversation... Electronic assistants can be extremely useful at saving people time on menial tasks. But to become a can't-live-without tool, an assistant "needs to be interesting enough to add to a group conversation," says Lili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft's Future Social Experiences labs. In other words, the A.I. needs its own personality, instead of being purely reactive. That necessary extra bit of oomph is why Google has hired a team of comedy writers from places like The Onion and Pixar to write dialogue for Google Assistant. 2. ...But it shouldn't be intrusive. Whether it's a friend, an overbearing presidential candidate, or a computer, nobody likes an interrupter. The group agrees that if A.I. is part of a conversation, it shouldn't butt in out of turn; if it's on a computer or phone, it shouldn't take over your screen or dismiss whatever you're working on. A small pop-up that can be addressed in a moment will suffice. It's a delicate balance, but an important one. 3. A.I. should feel natural. "If we're going to spend our lives around these things," Cheng says, "they should be designed around the way we naturally talk." For example, the back button on a browser is useful, but users will (rightly) have higher expectations for something they converse with out loud--so saying "back" to get to a previous option won't fly. Exchanges should flow like regular conversation. 4. It should be clear about what it's doing and what it's capable of. Several years ago, Gmail introduced a feature that automatically sorted mail into "important" and "unimportant" folders. The A.I. was very accurate, Cornwell says, but users weren't comfortable letting a computer make those decisions if they didn't know the criteria it was using. So Google applied that very same A.I. in a different way, sorting mail into folders based on work, personal, spam, etc.--and users loved it. Similarly, an A.I. system should set expectations: If users expect a digital assistant to be all-knowing and it turns out not to be, they'll be disappointed. Slack's chatbot, meant to serve as an office assistant, lets you know its limitations when it doesn't understand something: "Sometimes I have an easier time with a few simple keywords." 5. Creators need to be aware of any biases. "Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data you feed it," Cheng says. As such, A.I. will reflect the biases of the information it reads. Microsoft learned a tough lesson about this when it created Tay, a chatbot that quickly began spewing racist and profane answers back at the Twitterverse after some users taught it to do just that. Much of the time, the prejudices won't be so obvious. They might reflect slight biases based on the region, culture, gender, or likes and dislikes of the person who created it. It's important to keep this in mind when creating something intended to be used by a wide audience. In general, the more input, the better--but keep a watchful eye on it.

Why did the search giant team up with the 800-pound gorilla of accounting software? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 2:05PM Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently announced a new partnership with finance software giant Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to link their cloud ecosystems together. Google will integrate its recently rebranded cloud business platform, G Suite, with the cloud-based version of Intuit's QuickBooks accounting software. QuickBooks Online. Image source: Google Play. The two platforms will be united with a single sign-on, and data will be freely shared between the apps. From now on, G Suite subscribers can schedule tasks and meetings through Google Calendar, and those appointments will be automatically displayed in Quickbooks. This eliminates the need for users to manually enter each appointment in Quickbooks again, which also makes it easier for businesses to invoice their time. With a single sign-on, employees won't need separate credentials to access Quickbooks -- they can simply use their Google login. How does this partnership help Google? Google has been trying to beef up its cloud-based enterprise tools to compete more effectively against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That's why Google recently rebranded its Google Apps for Work portfolio (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Google+, Calendar, Hangouts, and Forms) as G Suite. G Suite is now a core component of the new "Google Cloud", which includes the Google Cloud Platform, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and its APIs for machine learning and enterprise mapping services. That reorganization provides companies with a big bundle of cloud services which not only counters Office, but also targets Windows and Azure. Google claims that its Cloud Platform now has over a billion users, putting it in the same league as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Search, and YouTube. But despite Google's best efforts, many companies still gravitate toward Microsoft's services due to the familiarity of Office and Windows' support for legacy software. Back in February, research firm Gartner reported that just over 13% of publicly listed companies used Office 365 or Google Apps for email. Within that total, 8.5% used Office 365, while just 4.7% used Google Apps for Work. The remainder used on-premises, hybrid, hosted, or private cloud email solutions hosted by smaller vendors. Since QuickBooks is one of the world's top accounting software brands, its integration into G Suite could certainly make Google's subscription options more appealing. It also strikes at a weak link in Microsoft's ecosystem, since the Outlook Calendar and QuickBooks can't be seamlessly linked in a similar way yet. How does this partnership help Intuit? Intuit VP Vinay Pai called the deal "the beginning of an exciting collaboration between Intuit and Google that will deliver huge benefits for the millions of small businesses that we serve around the world." Pai claims that 56% of QuickBooks customers are already using Google Calendar "to book appointments, schedule meetings, and track client work." He also notes that partnering with Google "will create important efficiencies between two solutions customers are already using." In the past, many companies created budget templates that Intuit customers could use in Google Docs. The tighter links between the two companies will likely encourage the creation of even more templates. Partnering with Google is another way to ensure that Intuit doesn't fall behind the technological curve. Back in 2013, it integrated its platform with Square's point of sale systems to automatically feed transaction data to its books. In late October, it introduced similar integrations with Apple Pay, PayPal, and automated payments company Bill.com. It also agreed to sell its older Quicken, Demandforce, and QuickBase businesses to focus more heavily on small businesses, cloud software, and tax preparation. A win-win deal for both companies Google and Intuit's partnership clearly helps both companies, but it probably won't help Google close the gap with Microsoft on its own, or ensure that Intuit stays ahead of its smaller rivals. But it's still a win-win deal which supports Google's renewed focus on the enterprise software market, as well as Intuit's ongoing efforts to evolve into a cloud-based company.

The group launched a spear phishing attack that targeted vulnerabilities in both the Windows operating system and Adobe Flash, according to Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group. The attack, first identified by Google's Threat Analysis Group, involved two zero-day vulnerabilities in Flash and the down level Windows kernel, he explained. It used the Flash exploit to gain control over browsers, elevate privileges to escape the browser sandbox and install a backdoor to gain access to a user's computer. Microsoft is working with Google and Adobe on a patch and plans to release the fix by Nov. 8, when the next update is scheduled, Myerson said. Those who use Microsoft Edge on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update are known to be protected from versions of the attack observed in the wild. Microsoft recommended that users upgrade to Windows 10 and said that those who enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will be able to detect the attempted attacks. Google's Disclosure Google should not have disclosed the vulnerability before the patches were made available, according to Myerson. "We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure," he said. "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing and puts customers at increased risk." Google on Monday revealed the Microsoft and Adobe vulnerabilities, noting that Adobe already had updated Flash to address the flaw. The Adobe patch is available through the Adobe updater and Chrome auto update. Google, per its policy of seven-day disclosure of actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, reported the remaining critical vulnerability in Windows, noting that it was being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was a local privilege escalation that could be used as a security sandbox escape, noted Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group in an online post. They urged users to make sure that Flash was auto updated, or to manually update if necessary. They should make sure to apply Windows patches, when available, Mehta and Leonard also wrote. Election Jitters The new attacks came at a sensitive time in the United States, with the presidential election less than a week away. Federal and local officials have made a major effort to ensure the public has confidence in the electoral system. Thus far, 48 states and 36 county and local governments have taken up an offer by the Department of Homeland Security to assist local governments with ensuring that the state and local election systems are protected against cyberattacks, DHS spokesperson Scott McConnell told TechNewsWorld. The states of Illinois and Arizona were targeted more than a month ago by a suspected Russian hack that impacted 200,000 voters in the Illinois voter registration database. There is little risk of a foreign hacker impacting the actual outcome of the race, but there are fears that a new round of cyberattacks could impact the level of confidence in the integrity of the system. "While the actual fallout is hard to predict, it's important to look at the chaos that Russian hackers have allegedly been sowing in the past couple months," said Bryan Burns, vice president of threat research at Proofpoint. "This group has access to multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, which are always very powerful, as no patches exist," he told TechNewsWorld. "The potential fallout, especially with the election just a week away, is quite concerning." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

They’re both supposed to be smart assistants, and part of that is answering your questions, no matter how dumb they are. In some cases, Alexa relies on skills that you have to enable, and those are only as good as the third-party creators make them. I tried asking Alexa for a Barefoot Contessa recipe, but even with the Food Network skill enabled, she was stumped. For many of its answers, the Google Home pulls from Google’s knowledge graph. Sometimes that makes for helpful answers, but other times, the answers are not quite right or out of date. Related: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker Here’s what happened when we asked the Amazon Dot and the Google Home a number of the same questions. Both are pretty good at giving the news. What’s the news? Alexa: “Here’s your flash briefing…” followed by NPR news, which I selected as one of my preferences. Home: “Here’s the latest news…” followed by an NPR news summary brought to me by a Chipotle ad. And they can each answer straightforward questions: When is Pi Day? Alexa: Pi Day will be on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. Home: Pi Day is on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. It’s easy enough to ask either Alexa or Google Home for the weather, but I wanted to try something a little more colloquial: Do I need a coat? Alexa: “I added coat to your shopping list.” Home: “Today in Portland, expect a high of 64 degrees and a low of 46 degrees.” Similarly, instead of asking specifically about the World Series during Game 7, I went for a less direct approach: “How are the Cubs doing?”   Alexa: “I don’t know how to answer your question. Home: “The Cubs are up six to three…” I honestly needed to know the answer to this question and decided to put Alexa and the Home to the test: What’s a substitute for coriander? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “According to Rachael Ray, if you are preparing a dish with dried coriander, cumin is a great substitution, as it provides a similar warm, spicy flavor.” Home also pointed out that cilantro, “which people either love or hate,” are the leaves of the coriander plants. Neither is all that great at giving recipes, though: What should I make for dinner tonight? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Let’s look for dinner options. What kind of food are you looking for?” I said, “Something healthy,” and the Home gave me a list of nearby restaurants. What’s a good chicken recipe? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Next, I decided to get political: Who should I vote for? Alexa: “You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies.” Home: “How you vote is up to you. I can look up information on the election, if you like.” Me: “OK.” Home: … Me: “What should I know about the election?” Home: “I can’t help with that yet.” Who’s going to win election? Alexa: “I can’t tell you who will win, but I can tell you who’s ahead in the polls. Just ask, who’s ahead in the polls.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Alexa: “According to Real Clear Politics’ average of national polling data between October 22 and November 1, Hillary Clinton is polling at 45.1 percent, Donald Trump at 43.1 percent, Gary Johnson at 4.6 percent, and Jill Stein at 2.1 percent.” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help, but I’m always learning.” Then I wanted to test their bilingual skills: How do you say “Hello” in Spanish? Alexa: “I can’t pronounce that but I’ve written the translation for you.” Home: “Buenos Dias!” How do you say, “I don’t know” in French? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Je ne sais pas.” I actually knew the answer to this next question, but I was trying to think of something a five-year-old would ask: What do koalas eat? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question. Home: “Leaves. According to Australian Koala Foundation, an adult koala eats between 200 to 500 grams of leaves each day. Koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. Occasionally, they will eat the leaves from some other native Australian trees, and they also use certain trees just for resting in.” Note: When I was transcribing the answer, I had to ask the question a couple of times, and Home once gave me the definition for equality instead. Both have some decent entertainment skills: Tell me a joke Alexa: “Why wasn’t the turkey hungry on Thanksgiving? Because he’s already stuffed.” Home: “What do you get when you put a vest on an alligator? An investigator.” Neither gave me exactly what I wanted when it came to this music request, though: Play “Dreaming” by Smashing Pumpkins Alexa: Played a 30-second preview, since I didn’t have it saved to my music library. Home: Started playing Siamese Dream I saw the casting news yesterday but couldn’t remember it: Who’s going to be in the Wrinkle in Time movie? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find an answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Note: I was thinking of Rowan Blanchard, but apparently Zach Galifianakis has been cast as well. I figured this was a pretty straightforward question but both struggled: How many Grammys has Beyoncé won? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to that question.” Home: “Beyoncé won the Grammy Award for Best R&B song.” Note: That’s just one of Beyoncé’s 20 Grammys. The Home’s answer to this made me think of this Simpsons moment: How many kids does Brad Pitt have? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer.” Home: “Six. His children include Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, and others.” The Jolie-Pitt kids in turn made me think of Mindy Kaling. Google Home has the ability to answer follow-ups without you having to repeat who or what you’re talking about, so I wanted to test that out. I still had to say “Mindy Kaling” for every follow-up with Alexa, though: How old is Mindy Kaling? Alexa: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling married?” Alexa: “Sorry, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling’s show still on?” Alexa: “Hm, I couldn’t find any movies called Mindy Kaling.’” Home: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is she married?” Home: “According to E!, Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak’s relationship remains complicated. The 35-year-old actress…” Me: Is her show still on? Home: “Here’s some information for, ‘Is Ellen’s show still on…’” Finally, I wanted to see how much they knew about each other: How much does the Amazon Dot cost? Alexa: “The new Amazon Dot costs $49.99.” Home: “According to Business Insider, Amazon Prime membership costs $99 per year…” How much does Google Home cost? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “Google Home costs $129.

Google has now responded to two of the antitrust charges, but unfortunately, it is still mum about the Android development charge. The company has until November 11th to respond. As for the two charges it did respond to in today’s blog post, the search giant says it’s not using the popularity of its search engine in order to promote its price comparison service, Google Shopping. Tieing into that is the promotion of Google’s ad delivery service, AdSense. The company’s SVP and general counsel Kent Walker made the post, saying that Google’s improvements to its services cannot be considered anti-competitive when the definition of online shopping services has been drawn too narrow by the EU Commission looking into this. The Commission’s original SO drew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon. It claimed that when we offered improved shopping ads to our users and advertisers, we were “favouring” our own services — and that this was bad for a handful of price comparison aggregators who claimed to have lost clicks from Google. But it failed to take into account the competitive significance of companies like Amazon and the broader dynamics of online shopping. Walker says because of that narrow definition, the EU fails to see that Amazon is by far the biggest reason online retailers are losing business and that the improvements that Google makes to services like Google Shopping and AdSense help drive traffic to other places, rather than favoring one particular retailer just because it’s the largest. We then showed that our improved ads were helpful to users and merchants. We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t “favouring” — that’s listening to our customers. Google’s response to the Android claims will be interesting to see, but if the company is found guilty of all three of these antitrust complaints, it could face up to $3.5 billion in fines. However, according to a leaked document discovered in the Android antitrust objections, the penalty could order Google to stop offering discounts and payments for pre-installing apps on devices. local_offer    EU   Google   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (17) stars Further Reading Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

By Mary-Ann Russon November 4, 2016 17:45 GMT Chinese researchers have found a critical security flaw in the OAuth 2.0 protocol that enables attackers to hijack user accounts in a large number of Android appsiStock You know that nifty tool that lets you log into new websites and services using your Facebook or Twitter profile? Chinese researchers have discovered a new attack that enables hackers to steal your information and hijack your accounts on a huge number of different Android apps, which have collectively been downloaded over one billion times. Cybersecurity researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have found security flaws in the OAuth2.0 single sign-on protocol, which was designed to enable users to quickly sign into third-party services and apps using their social media accounts, rather than having to create a username and password. The researchers analysed 600 of the most popular Android apps on Google Play US and Google Play China and found that 182 apps support single sign-on using Facebook, Google and Sina Weibo accounts. Because the OAuth protocol was originally designed for websites, the researchers found that app developers had struggled to apply the protocol correctly in 41% of these apps, including hotel booking apps, holiday planning apps, VoIP call apps, shopping apps, online dating apps, banking apps, news apps, browser apps, video apps and music apps. When you sign into an app – for illustration purposes, let's say the IMDB app – the app asks Facebook to authenticate your identity, and Facebook's server responds with an access token. However, on many of the Android apps, the app developers were not checking whether the information being sent by the social media accounts was correct. And sometimes, the researchers found that the apps would immediately log in an individual even if the user ID information sent through by Facebook, Google or Sina Weibo didn't even match the account details of the user that had an account with the Android app. Man-in-the-Middle attack lets hacker hijack Android app accounts At Black Hat Europe 2016, the researchers demonstrated that if the attacker could discover the email address associated with your Facebook profile, and your name that they could then get out their own mobile device, download the IMDB app and use a man-in-the-middle proxy to replace your profile with their profile. So when the IMDB app asked for the access token, it would look as if Facebook had returned the attacker's profile, instead of yours. And with this, the attacker can then directly control your apps. This might not be a big deal with the IMDB app, but in the case of the hotel booking app, the hacker would be able to pay for room bookings on your credit card, purchase music and videos from the music and video services, and even impersonate you on chat apps. CUHK PhD candidate and lead author of the research Yang Ronghai says that the attack can't only be blamed on app developers – the identification providers Facebook, Google and Sina Weibo are responsible too. "Identity providers don't offer clear developer guidelines for third-party app developers. After we reported this issue to Facebook, Google and Sina, all of them recognised the need to improve the guidelines. Their respective Software Development Kits (SDK) are also confusing for the third-party app developers to use," he told IBTimes UK, adding that Google and Sina have taken action to make OAuth 2.0 guidelines clearer for app developers. "When receiving the identity proof, ie. the access token and user info, the app developers should make a server-to-server verification of the access token and not directly use the user information. In other words, the back-end server should use the access token to retrieve the user data from the back-end server of the identity providers and then use this data to identify the user."

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google's latest HTTPS report shows the web is getting more secure Listen | Print By James Walker     Nov 4, 2016 in Technology Google has released its latest HTTPS Transparency Report, indicating how many websites are migrating their servers to use secure connections. Significant progress has been made in the past 18 months, keeping data protected and users safe online. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your computer and the web server. This prevents attackers from intercepting data transfers and extracting sensitive details, such as your username and password for an online service. While there are obvious benefits to using the protocol, much of the web continues to be based on the insecure HTTP. According to Google, considerable progress is now being made as HTTPS becomes more important. The rise of Internet of Things devices and the prevalence of interactions with third-party services necessitates secure connections. General websites are also making the switch, including entertainment and media sites that have begun to turn on HTTPS. Google has added a new section to its Transparency Report that details how HTTPS usage has been increasing over time. 18 months ago, desktop Chrome users on Windows, Mac and Linux were visiting secure sites around 40 percent of the time. Today, two-thirds of page loads on these systems are made over HTTPS. A key reason it's taken so long for HTTPS to see wide adoption is its complexity. In many cases, it's difficult to implement on existing sites and services. Securing an individual website can be complicated, due to HTTPS' certificate process. Most sites will face additional trouble in the form of external connections. Ad networks often don't use HTTPS but are present on many webpages. This can prevent HTTPS working properly across the entire site. Google said it is continuing its work towards migrating to HTTPS "a no-brainer." It noted the positive experiences of retailer Wayfair and technology news site CNET, both of which recently transitioned to HTTPS. Neither site noticed any impact on search rankings or overall traffic. "Security has always been critical to the web, but challenges involved in site migration have inhibited HTTPS adoption for several years," said Google. "In the interest of a safer web for all, at Google we've worked alongside many others across the online ecosystem to better understand and address these challenges, resulting in real change. A web with ubiquitous HTTPS is not the distant future. It's happening now, with secure browsing becoming standard for users of Chrome." The recent rise in HTTPS' adoption has been attributed to a relatively new service called Let's Encrypt. The free certificate authority simplifies HTTPS migrations, making turning on HTTPS as easy as running a set of commands. Its offer hasn’t gone unnoticed by site administrators. In March, it issued its millionth certificate. In September, it gave out the ten millionth. Let's Encrypt is now believed to be the biggest certificate registrar online. It's a non-profit organisation "run for the public's benefit."

After recently opening an office in San Francisco, the Canadian wearable tech company became part of the ongoing debate about the relationship between the Canadian and American tech ecosystems. As it turns out, even at a Canadian tech conference, the United States is the elephant in the room. The scent of Silicon Valley sits heavy on every panel and every discussion. This, however, isn’t as discouraging as it might seem. Considering Canada is situated directly above what’s come to be known as the largest innovation ecosystem in history, it’s to be expected. However, Google Canada’s GO North event for Canadian tech professionals demonstrated some tangible faith in Canada’s ability to be a competitive ally in the space. Google Canada took the opportunity through Go North to launch a $5 million prize for nonprofit innovation called the Google.org impact challenge. Google.org, the company’s philanthropic division, will award the money across 10 organizations to help launch their ideas. Five winning organizations will receive $750,000, while an additional five will receive $250,000. The deadline for eligible non profits to submit ideas is November 26th. It seems that for the first time, Google sees Canada as an ally rather than as just a small market. While the Canadian tech landscape has certainly evolved from the tumbleweeds-in-the-desert scene it projected ten years ago, it’s been hard to consolidate that growth when the country’s innovation hubs — Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo and Vancouver — are so far apart. GO North brought the community together in a way few members of it had seen before. People they’d only ever spoken to on the phone were recognized by their name tags and people who’d supported each other in spades on Twitter were forced to talk to one another other face to face. Panelists featured some of Canada’s most well-known tech titans, including Shopify’s Harley Finkelstein, Dragons Den’s Michelle Romanow, Kik’s Ted Livingston and Mappedin’s Hongwei Liu. Google Canada CEO Sam Sebastian opened the event with a few words of encouragement. “Canada is no longer a place defined by the limits of its geography,” said Sebastian. It’s true that over the past five years the world has finally begun paying attention to their northern watchdogs. Canadians have been in the spotlight as of late, in ways that go beyond our innovation community. “From the perspective of a new Canadian, what we have here is pretty exceptional. The spirit of openness and inclusion shapes not only our national identity but in how we work together,” continued Sebastian. While a spirited, Canada’s innovation community is desperately outnumbered. Some of the event’s key topics included being confident enough to attract American investors, selling to American customers, getting acquired by American companies and familiarizing the United State’s technology hubs. By this point, one begins to sense a theme. “Canada is probably the best place in the world to live if you’re forming a tech company,” said Shopify CFO Harley Finkelstein. He can’t in good conscience however claim that Canada is in a place where it doesn’t need the United States. “Silicon Valley is Mecca. You need to get your butt down there.” While Canada isn’t ready to stand on its own just yet, it’s definitively clear that the population’s collective attitude towards the United States is changing. The first wave of big-time Canadian entrepreneurs, who were once intimidated by the thought of breaking into the United States, have discovered an eager cohort of newly minted founders with whom to share their experiences. The Michelle Romanows and Tobias Lüktes of the country have made tech entrepreneurship a less lonely endeavor. Romanow, who’s founded several notable companies, including Snap Saves, which was acquired by Groupon in 2014, claims that she wishes she targeted the United States sooner, and encourages today’s founders to do just that. “It’s not that the U.S. is ten times bigger, it’s that the U.S. sets the technology agenda for the rest of the world. If you’re a technology platform and you win the U.S., the rest of the world will come in after,” she argues. While discussions during the conference barely wavered from Silicon Valley, rather than focusing on its inarguable importance, the event’s panelists steered the conversation towards weaning Canada off its influence. Several Canadian companies have acted on the desire to give Canada a leg to stand on, whether that means maintaining a Canadian head office or developing a uniquely Canadian voice. Thalmic Labs’ Scott Greenberg, who presented at GO North, explains that though the company has just opened an office in San Francisco, it’s home will always be in Waterloo, Ontario. Thalmic Labs is the developer of the Myo armband. “We are very proudly Canadian. We are very much proud to be here. However, San Francisco, New York and the startup centres are extremely influential and they have a lot of experienced people there,” he states. Thalmic Labs is one of the Canada’s most notable wearable technology successes. While it has offices in both Waterloo and San Francisco, the company has strategically decided to maintain its headquarters in Waterloo. It bears some resemblance to a company which most people have forgotten has a Canadian connection — Pebble. Founded in Waterloo, the company keeps just a small engineering office in Canada, and has gone on to become an international success. The question that remains is, have we entered a phase in the country’s development where a company with a Canadian head office will be considered equal to American-based companies by investors who get just a glimpse of a company’s culture? Finkelstein thinks so. In fact, this is one of his goals for Canada’s tech sector going forward. “As a Canadian entrepreneur that runs a Canadian company, I want to see more head offices here instead of satellite offices,” said Finkelstein. Furthermore, in the quickening decline of Canada’s resources economy, the Canadian government is taking definitive steps to ensure that the country has a future in technology. Navdeep Bains, the Federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, believes in Canada’s innovative future. In addition to playing a critical role in the development of Canada’s innovation agenda, Bains has proposed a cluster-based approach to maintaining the hubs, such as those in Toronto and Vancouver, that have developed naturally. “The digital economy is now the economy itself,” he proclaimed in a speech given during Go North. “Virtually every sector of the economy is propelled by digital technologies.” While it sounds rehearsed from the mouths of experts such as Bains, Finkelstein and Romanow, who’ve sat on dozens of panels and time and time again pushed entrepreneurship to eager crowds, the audience seemed behind them every step of the way. It seems that, for the first time, the market is reacting to the ambitions of Canadians rather than the other way around. Maggie Fox, a senior vice president with SAP and a member of the recently launched DMZ advisory council, takes the microphone during the question period to voice this view. The only thing holding Canadians back, she believes, is their perspective of themselves as house cats. “Being Canadian is actually the perfect nationality. I think we just need to get out of our own way,” she proclaims. By the end of the day, at least one thing was made clear. Canada is ready to be more than the United States’ little brother. Zee US is “the largest innovation ecosystem in history” ??? Russ I’m not aware of Pebble having been founded in Vancouver, but perhaps that’s where the company was incorporated. Eric Migicovsky formed his early smartwatch ideas while he was a student at the University of Waterloo, and I had thought he went straight from there to Y Combinator. The “something in the water in Waterloo” quote has been floating around for years, but I’m not sure who originated it. It definitely wasn’t Scott Greenberg, but his use of it underscores how much it resonates in the local tech industry. Ipse This might change next week…. ????

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Google contests EU antitrust charges on comparison shopping, AdSense Original complainant Foundem counters Google's claims on Amazon, eBay competition. by Kelly Fiveash (UK) - Nov 4, 2016 5:08 pm UTC Login to bookmark 18 Getty Images/Urich Baumgartgen Google has rebutted the European Commission's anti-competitive charges against the ad giant's alleged abuse of dominance in its price comparison, specialised search services, and AdSense businesses. The company—after a number of deadline extensions from Brussels—came out fighting in a blog post penned by Google's chief counsel Kent Walker that was published on Thursday: In recent years, we’ve improved the format of our ads to include more informative displays with pictures, prices, and links where you can buy products. Showing more useful ads benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, you, our users. That’s why we disagree with the European Commission’s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition. It claimed that EC antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's charge on the company favouring its own price comparison and specialised search—or, as Google prefers to describe it, "shopping services"—over its competitors carried too "narrow" a definition, arguing that it excluded the "competitive significance" of Amazon and other players in that market. Walker said: Our response demonstrated that online shopping is robustly competitive, with lots of evidence supporting the common-sense conclusion that Google and many other websites are chasing Amazon, by far the largest player on the field. UK price comparison site Foundem—the original complainant in the EC case against Google, which was formally opened in 2010—said it was disappointed with the multinational's response. It said that "Google continues to publicly defend its anti-competitive search manipulation practices by misrepresenting both the charges it faces and the important differences between 'shopping' and 'shopping comparison'." Google—to ram home its argument—added that Brussels' case "just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online." It repeatedly talked about how the ad market is constantly shifting, in comments that appeared to largely ignore the historic nature of some of the EC's charges against Google. "There are hundreds of shopping comparison sites and over the past 10 years, some gained traffic, others lost traffic. Some exited the market, others entered," Walker said. "This kind of dynamic competition is undeniable. Online advertising is evolving rapidly, with companies like Facebook, Pinterest, and many others re-inventing what it means to connect merchants with consumers." He claimed that "a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe." Foundem countered: Unfortunately for Google, its continuing protestations about the flourishing fortunes of Amazon and eBay remain the red herrings they have always been. Google does not (yet) have an eCommerce, auction, or merchant-platform service that competes with Amazon or eBay. Therefore, Google does not (yet) have any incentive to anti-competitively penalise Amazon or eBay in its natural search results, and it does not (yet) have any competing service of its own to anti-competitively favour. Separately in the same blog post, Google also disputed the commission's charge against its AdSense business tactics—though it didn't flesh out the reasons for its beef with Vestager in that particular case. Similarly, Google said that it would respond in the next few days to the commission's charge against its Android operating system. Presumably, this too will publicly rebut the bloc's competition chief. The commission is now mulling over Google's responses before it decides on how it might proceed on the three separate charges levelled against the ad giant. If fines are imposed on Google, it faces penalties of up to five percent of its annual turnover for each charge—potentially billions of euros.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google’s RCS push will never work without Verizon Chris Burns - Nov 4, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit While Google announces they’ve begun working with the first US mobile carrier to release RCS to replace SMS and MMS, Verizon is absent from the scene. RCS is also known as Rich Communication Service, and it’s aimed at turning text messaging into a much more function-full service. At this time quite a few mobile groups have joined the call to make RCS a standard for all – but Verizon isn’t amongst them. AT&T launched RCS back in November of 2015, while T-Mobile introduced RCS into their network back in July of 2016. Today Google announced that they’re working with Sprint to bring RCS to their network. Verizon is not a part of this RCS-is-awesome club, announced earlier this year as a nameless global initiative for RCS. SEE: How to escape iMessage and switch from iPhone to Pixel At the same time, just as the RCS standard seems to be getting off the ground, Google has just launched a pair of smartphones. The Pixel and the Pixel XL are sold by Google online unlocked, able to be used on T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. And Verizon, according to their ads, is the only place you can get a Pixel. Verizon is not the only place you can buy a Google Pixel smartphone. Google has the Pixel – their most major smartphone release ever – available online with the ability to work with any network. But it’s clear Verizon still has the upper hand. According to a Q2 2016 study done by Strategy Analytics, Verizon had 142.7 million subscribers. AT&T was close behind with 131.8 million, T-Mobile had 67.4 million, and Sprint was forth with 58.4 million subscribers. This information is released with Fierce Wireless and also suggests that Sprint was the only one of the top four carriers to lose customers quarter-to-quarter in “net adds”. Until Verizon starts to see subscriber losses as a direct result of being the only major carrier without RCS, they won’t fold. They’ll continue to work with their own Verizon Messenger and won’t pay RCS any mind. Until Verizon adopts RCS, the service is just another iMessage – lots of potential without full adoption.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed There’s no best way to handle disclosure of zero-day vulnerabilities 04 Nov 2016 14 Vulnerability Post navigation Previous: Berners-Lee raises spectre of weaponized open data Next: Monday review – the hot 17 stories of the week by Maria Varmazis 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Earlier this week, the headlines flashed with news that Google had disclosed a vulnerability to Microsoft that allows local privilege escalation in Windows 10. This vulnerability is a zero-day, meaning these vulnerabilities did not have an immediate fix, and by making these vulnerabilities public, theoretically an attacker could take advantage of this information and use the vulnerability to their own advantage. A lesser-discussed note to this story is that Google had disclosed this vulnerability privately to Microsoft a week prior, at the same time it had made a similar private disclosure to Adobe about its own actively exploited vulnerability in Flash (CVE-2016-7855). In response to Google’s disclosure, Adobe made a fix to Flash about five days later, with the security update already available to the public. This is good news for Adobe, as Google has a published disclosure policy for what it defines as actively exploited critical vulnerabilities: it will privately notify the vendor and give them seven days to make a fix, otherwise it goes public with the news. Google’s reasoning? We believe that more urgent action—within seven days—is appropriate for critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more computers will be compromised. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Google certainly had reason for concern, as Microsoft later identified that the Russian APT group Fancy Bear was already actively using Google’s disclosed zero-day in their own attacks before Google’s disclosure even happened. Microsoft hasn’t yet issued a fix for the Windows vulnerability, but in a blog post response they say one will be available on the next Patch Tuesday, November 8. So what’s a normal vulnerability disclosure policy? There’s no agreement in the security industry for a standard vulnerability disclosure. Many abide by what they call “responsible disclosure,” which means privately reaching out to the vendor with the details of a discovered vulnerability, with the intent to give them time to fix it, and only making the details of the vulnerability public once the issue has already been patched. Often whoever discovered the vulnerability works with the affected vendor to fix the problem. As long as the vendor is making a good-faith effort, the timeline for fixing a vulnerability can be weeks or even months, although many set a deadline to get things fixed before they go public. Google recommends 60 days, though others will give more time. Not everyone in the security industry agrees with the principles of responsible disclosure. Though it may strike some as reckless, some believe that the best course of action is to go public as soon as possible, especially if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. While Google gave both Adobe and Microsoft seven days for a fix, others might have gone public straight away, without giving them a chance to fix it. The idea behind immediately disclosing an actively exploited vulnerability is that the public pressure to fix the vulnerability could make all the difference in the vendor taking it seriously, especially if they have been unresponsive or uncooperative in past disclosure efforts. This approach can sometimes backfire, however, as it makes a potential new avenue for attack public. However, it can also backfire on the vendor if they don’t respond quickly. Do you think immediately disclosing vulnerabilities is too reckless, or the right thing to do? Or was Google right?

Reply Nobody_Holme says: November 4, 2016 at 5:31 pm I fully support Google’s stance. Vendor gets time to patch, but pressure of public shame if it fails. I suspect in reality, competing businesses would do well to give a little leway instead of being seen to snipe at each other, but equally, they’re going to snipe anyway, so doing it when justified is not a big deal. Reply Corey Hitchens says: November 4, 2016 at 6:07 pm 7 day advance notice is more than fair for companies with a full development team supporting thousands of consumers. Smaller businesses with less resources should be given 30 days. Many companies won’t even bother fixing something until its public. A lot of times, the product is vulnerable because best practice coding was not made in the first place. Reply Sean Briggs says: November 4, 2016 at 6:42 pm I think 7 days is is reasonable. The public should know so they can ensure that systems that are vulnerable can be monitored more closely. Reply Jim says: November 4, 2016 at 7:06 pm Seven days seems like enough for an in-the-wild zero-day. But, there are probably exceptions, especially in the area of operating systems. Operating systems are so complex that it can be a daunting task to fix ANY bug in a week. So, yeah, it’s not written in stone. Maybe it should be (like via a standards body, with input from larger companies and security firms)? Reply clifford cuellar says: November 4, 2016 at 9:41 pm I think Google has the right response. Work with the vendor for a week, then go public if that has failed and let public opinion go ti work. My reasoning is that a zero-day is quite possibly already known and used by the bad guys, and failure to fix just gives them more time. At least a warning tells users to be extra vigilant about unusual activity. Reply Tim Boddington says: November 5, 2016 at 6:15 pm I agree with the earlier comments. However, maybe there should be an announcement at the outset that there is a security weakness in a product, but not what it is. Reply Alan Robertson says: November 6, 2016 at 10:35 am I’m not a Microsoft fan (I’m a Linux user), however, in my opinion this was reckless of Google. What did this achieve? All this did was take a bad situation and make it worse by advertising the fact that there was an active exploit, which in turn only encourages more people to abuse it. Google knows full well that Microsoft has adhered to patch Tuesday for quite some time and the timing of this exploit being released to the public seems to be more political than a genuine care for the community. This is the second time that they have done this and the second time they have done so half way between patch Tuesdays – I do not consider this to be coincidental. When did they precisely find out about the vulnerability? Did Google sit on this vulnerability and choose to release it mid way between patch Tuesday cycles or did they release it straight away? If they chose to release this half way between patch Tuesdays then their intention was to damage Microsoft’s reputation and not to report a critical bug. Additionally, how many other “attention diverting” Windows exploits are they sitting on? More transparency please Google – start with log files and a detailed account as to WHEN the zero day team became aware of this. It’s a shame when your zero day task force starts to become more aligned to damaging a competitor than actually genuinely helping to improve security, especially as Microsoft has botched more updates in the last two years than they have in the last twenty. Wouldn’t it make more sense to get the patch correct first time round? An unplanned, rushed out patch could potentially harm more PC’s than the active exploit could – BSOD / endless boot cycles etc. As for Google, they have a bit of a cheek! Android is rarely updated: “More than half of Androids have unpatched security holes” Sophos, 17 SEP 2012 “Android “Master Key” vulnerability – more malware exploits code verification bypass” Sophos 09 AUG 2013 “Shocking” Android browser bug could be a “privacy disaster” Sophos 16 Sep 2014 “87% of Android devices are exposed to at least one critical vulnerability” Sophos, 15 OCT 2015 “900 million Androids vulnerable to Quadrooter bugs” Sophos, 09 AUG 2016 Seriously Google? Why can’t your own zero day team to fix your own operating system first? How about starting with actually having the ability to patch rather than dumping the responsibility on the device manufacturer? You don’t see Microsoft saying it’s the responsibility of Dell / HP / Lenovo etc. to patch Windows? So why does Google get away with this? Reply John says: November 6, 2016 at 11:52 pm In the case of an actively exploited zero-day, public disclosure after 7 days also gives end users the ability to implement alternate solutions to either detect or block exploits using technologies such as IPS and end-point behavioural analytics (whichever is applicable in the specific case). So even if there is no patch, customers can still find other ways to protect themselves. Reply mr x says: November 7, 2016 at 9:28 am wonder how many have opted for 30 day delay on updates to be installed, as that can leave some systems open for long time unless MS has option to force updates that are deemed as currently been exploited (windows 10 you can delay updates upto 30 days when they have come out, and feature upgrades for a year) Reply David Pottage says: November 7, 2016 at 11:02 am There is a second reason for a quick public disclosure, an that is so that users and sys-admins can do their own mitigation while waiting for a proper fix to become available. For example, if it became known that there is an unfixed zero day with MS Powerpoint files, I might update the configuration of my email server or UTM to block such files from external sources, or to add a very stern warning when allowing them through. Of course such a block would be annoying for my users, so I would hope Microsoft would be working very hard on a fix, but if such a bug where being actively exploited, and dozens of emails with booby trapped attachments where arriving every day, I would want something to reduce the risk while I waited for a more complete fix. Reply Alan Robertson says: November 7, 2016 at 4:12 pm Hello David, Unfortunately this is a kernel bug – your UTM isn’t going to stop that. As always it appears as though Flash was used as a means of a delivery system for this exploit – I can only assume that they were spear phishing with a hacked website and hoping the victim would fall for it. Reply Paul Ducklin says: November 7, 2016 at 4:41 pm What I think David is suggesting is not any sort of “Sophos ad,” but merely a way of illustrating how detailed information about an exploit can help you to add mitigations of your own to reduce your exposure, even if your temporary defence [a] only deals with a specific instance of an attack and [b] causes side-effects that you don’t want to suffer for ever. Reply Jim says: November 7, 2016 at 1:53 pm Google should never have revealed this information publically. They should technically be liable if there is a ramp in attacks or exploitations after the release of such information. I’m not pro Microsoft or anti-google at all, but this is just careless and actually ends up aiding and abetting exploitation of these things Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

But did you know that the tool did not work for about 6-months prior to that? So since around April 2016, if you tried to demote a sitelink using that tool - it may have not worked. John Mueller of Google said this in this mornings webmaster hangout on YouTube at the 5:17 mark into the video. He said "the effect of this tool has been dialed down to almost nothing in the last half year or so." He added that "if you have been using this tool to kind of maintain your sitelinks, then probably we haven’t been taking the input from your submissions there into account and we have been using our algorithms anyway." Here is the video embed: Here is the transcript: I guess as a bit of background with the whole sitelinks tool that we had there. This is something that we had been experimenting with over the last couple of years and essentially the sitelinks use normal rankings. So there is nothing special around the sitelinks there. And also the effect of this tool has been dialed down to almost nothing in the last half year or so. So that is something where, if you have been using this tool to kind of maintain your sitelinks, then probably we haven’t been taking the input from your submissions there into account and we have been using our algorithms anyway. So nothing really changed there, outside of us not providing a tool that doesn’t change anything in the search results. Forum discussion at Google+.

By Bob Violino | November 4, 2016 -- 16:16 GMT (09:16 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Self-driving car By 2020, smart machines -- technologies that learn on their own, adapt their behavior based on experience, and are able to come up with unanticipated results -- will be a top five investment priority for more than 30 percent of CIOs, according to new findings from research firm Gartner. special feature AI, Automation, and Tech Jobs There are some things that machines are simply better at doing than humans, but humans still have plenty going for them. Here's a look at how the two are going to work in concert to deliver a more powerful future for IT, and the human race. Read More With these machines moving toward fully autonomous operation for the first time, balancing the need to exercise control over the systems versus the drive to realize business benefits is crucial, the firm says. Presenting the research findings at a Gartner symposium in Australia, research vice president Brian Prentice said Google's self-driving car project is a prime example of why pursuing full autonomy might be neither possible nor desirable in smart machines. "Human beings are still required as the final point of redundancy in an autonomous vehicle, so a fully autonomous car requires a steering wheel should a driver be required to take control," Prentice said. "But putting a steering wheel in an autonomous car means a fully licensed, sober driver must always be in the car and prepared to take control if necessary." Not only does this destroy many of the stated benefits of autonomous vehicles, but it changes the role of the driver from actively controlling the car to passively monitoring it for potential failure." The "Google Steering Wheel Dilemma" is representative of a challenge all smart machine projects must face, according to Gartner. "Smart machines respond to their environment," Prentice said. "But what is the environment that the smart machine is responding to? Environments that are largely uncontrollable are not amenable to smart machine projects because it is difficult, if not impossible, to model accurately." The challenge for organizations looking into this technology is to figure out what is actually controllable, and limit smart machines to those activities that can be accurately modeled and managed. Major unresolved problems in machine learning technologies, such as how to make sure learning data is fully representative and the avoidance of "reward hacking," need to be addressed before any autonomous machine that learns from its environment can be deployed as a mass-market solution, Prentice noted. "The vision of the fully autonomous vehicle will not become reality, for any car manufacturer, in a time frame that doesn't fall into the realm of science fiction," Prentice said. "The failure of this vision will be set against the backdrop of advances in smaller, more pragmatic applications of machine learning in automobiles that will improve safety and driver experience." CIOs who are looking to maximize the benefits of smart machine technology adoption should plan to deliver smart machine-enabled services that help and are overseen by human workers, rather than those that are fully autonomous, Gartner said. They also need to identify and analyze, at the beginning of any project aiming to make use of smart machine technologies, the constraints that smart machine adoption will eventually face.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Nov 05, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google rejects antitrust allegations made by EU AFP, BRUSSELS EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager uses a smartphone to take a photograph from the podium at the Delegation of the EU to the US, before a news conference in Washington on Sept. 19. Photo: EPA US-based Internet company Google on Thursday rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to antitrust allegations by Brussels earlier this year. Google filed objections against charges made by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog that the shopping case “still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online.” “We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law and economics,” Walker said. The EU now has three cases against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager. The biggest and most recent case involves Google’s Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company’s most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google’s alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged last year, and then in July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party Web sites. The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks Corp, Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp. This story has been viewed 1079 times. Comments will be moderated.

Google fires back on EU antitrust case, and says it’s only playing catch-up with Amazon Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders November 04, 2016 The start of the affair. (Reuters/Francois Lenoir) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders November 04, 2016 The European Commission’s grasp of the e-commerce world is so weak, it doesn’t even “fit with the reality” of how people actually shop online. And by the way, Amazon is where consumers go to compare prices, not Google. That’s the message Google sent to the commission yesterday in a blog post by general counsel Kent Walker. The commission is charging Google for anti-competitive behavior around three of its products, including its shopping comparison feature. Fines could run into the billions. Google’s post was published as the firm submitted formal responses to two of the commission’s charges. It said it would soon respond to the commission’s charges around Android, its smartphone operating system, which is seen as potentially the most serious of the outstanding cases. Google’s missive was laced with condescension. The company schooled the commission on what it claims are the realities of online shopping. “We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” Walker wrote. Here’s Google’s argument: Consumers aren’t going to Google, or other search engines, to find the best price for a product; they’re going straight to merchants to do so. Dedicated shopping apps, some of which belong to merchants, are the most popular way for people to shop on their smartphones, Google claims. Amazon is “by far the largest player in the field” when it comes to online shopping, with Google “chasing” it. Amazon is where customers go first to check for prices—it’s twice as popular as Google for this function in Germany, according to one piece of research cited by Google. If anyone’s going to dominate price-shopping, it’s Amazon, not Google. Customers go to Amazon to price-shop, and to actually make purchases, making it an “even stronger competitor,” Google says. When Amazon enters a new European market, traffic drops to sites that only provide price-comparison, Google claims. The commission’s suggested fix is for Google to highlight price-comparison sites in its search results. But Google says its data shows that its users don’t want to use those sites, and that the commission’s solution would be tantamount to subsidies for these sites. Opposition to Google’s arguments sprung up immediately. FairSearch, a group that campaigns against Google and whose members include Nokia, Oracle, Expedia, and others, said: “When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money.” Google appears to be digging its heels in for what looks set to be a protracted fight over its future in Europe.

According to the NFL, the series will deliver an immersive experience for users. That’s kind of the point of VR, really, but the series will ostensibly allow users to experience what it’s like to train with the Philadelphia Eagles defensive line in the build up to the big match day. Additional episodes will look at the culture of American Football in other parts of the country, like Green Bay, or specifically the internal organisational workings of the San Diego Chargers. We can already see the most viewed episode being the one the NFL describes as letting viewers “tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders” … “This series will give fans an opportunity to connect with the NFL like never before, whether they are on YouTube or using Google’s virtual reality headset, Daydream View,” said Amit Singh, Vice President, Google VR.  “We’re thrilled to work with the NFL to capture the series with Jump and bring it to YouTube and Daydream.” NFL’s adoption of VR on such a serious scale is a big win for the technology as a whole, despite its exclusivity to Google Daydream. In the past, questions have been asked about the feasibility of the technology and its success largely depends on the adoption of VR as a viable commercial medium from a majority of markets. That is exactly what’s happening with the NFL’s adoption, and it isn’t a purely esoteric play only appealing to the USA. American Football has a rapidly growing appeal outside of North America, with London’s Wembley Stadium playing host to a number of competitive NFL fixtures every season, with every game a sell-out. Google has snared a bit of a win with that in mind.

Sony releases Android Nougat beta update to Xperia X Performance It is also interesting that the global smartphone OS shipments and market share in Q3 2016 grew 10.3 percent over the year, whereas iOS and other operating systems lost a sizable share. Apple's exclusive iOS for its iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices captured 12.1 percent, leaving a negligible share of 0.3 percent to other operating systems for mobile devices. "Android's domination of global smartphone shipments remained strong in Q3 2016, with a record 88 percent of all smartphones now running Google's OS," Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement. "Android's gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa." But that dominance comes with its own challenges. According to Woody Oh, director of Strategy Analytics, "Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place." The report also added that the global smartphone shipments grew 6 percent year-over-year to 375.4 million during the quarter, which is the fastest growth rate for a year. Samsung took the lead in the global smartphone shipments with 75.3 million units, which dropped from 83.8 million a year ago. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo recorded major growth in the smartphone shipments, contributing 9 percent, 5.8 percent and 4.9 percent to the total smartphone market share during the quarter.

Along with BT and Mozy, the companies have publicly pledged to join the government’s Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) clampdown to prevent users getting caught out by sudden price hikes or service terminations. In a statement announcing the move, the CMA said all four companies had committed to addressing several areas of concern in their terms of use. As such, they’ve promised to give users “adequate notice” ahead of any significant changes being made to prices or contracts, and greater transparency around how to terminate their deals with the firms. The CMA has previously warned cloud firms that indulging in such behaviour could put them at risk of enforcement action for violating the Consumer Rights Act 2015. LiveDrive, JustCloud and Dixons Carphone were first to commit to the CMA’s campaign back in May 2016, but the likes of Dropbox, Google and Microsoft were noticeable by their absence. With Google and Dropbox now joining the fold, Computer Weekly contacted Microsoft – whose OneDrive cloud storage services is used by hundreds of millions of users worldwide – to see if they have any plans to follow suit. At the time of writing, the company has not responded.   The CMA said the organisation is, however, working with a number of other organisations who are yet to publicly commit to making changes to their terms of use and ensure their behaviour does not fall foul of consumer rights laws. Read more about terms and conditions of cloud use Remote device management firm LogMeIn comes under fire from IT support and managed service providers, who claim its subscription renewal system has hit them with hundreds of pounds of “unexpected” credit card charges. LiveDrive, JustCloud and Dixons Carphone commit to fairer usage terms for cloud customers, but Microsoft and Google are conspicuous by their absence. Nisha Arora, senior director for consumer enforcement at the CMA, said the commitments should go some way to ensuring consumers know they can entrust their data to the cloud with confidence. “People increasingly rely on cloud storage as a safe and convenient place to keep family photos, music and important documents, so it is vital that they are treated fairly and are not hit by unexpected changes to price or storage levels,” said Arora. “We are pleased that these four companies have followed the three others which agreed commitments earlier this year to improve their terms and conditions, providing a better service for their customers.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

For many, it seemed improbable that more than 50% of the country would vote to leave the European Union. Of course, the Google data ended up being eerily accurate. When will the US election results be announced? Everything you need to know Now, with the US election appearing a tighter race than previously expected, Google Trends data is once again being carefully studied. And the results are perhaps a little surprising. Given all the controversies around Donald Trump, one might be forgiven for expecting that search data for the Republican nominee would be greater than for the Clinton campaign. Yet in the last week this has not been the case. Searches for Hillary Clinton have soared since October 28, consistently ranking around 10% ahead of Trump The top trending questions include: ‘Where was Hillary Clinton born?’, ‘Will Hillary be indicted’, ‘How much is Hillary Clinton’s net worth’, ‘Where is Hillary?’ and ‘How old is Hillary’. Top searches were for the Clinton Foundation and emails If you look at search data in some of the swing states, searches for Hillary Clinton are also ahead In Nevada: Clinton has 47% of the searches while Trump has 42%, in Arizona: Clinton has 50% to Trump’s 39%, in Colorado: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 40%, in Iowa: Clinton has 49% to Trump’s 39%, in Ohio: Clinton has 47% to Trump’s 41%, Florida: Clinton has 48% to Trump’s 43%, North Carolina: Clinton has 47% to Trump’s 42%, Virginia: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 39%, Pennsylvania: Clinton has 48% to Trump’s 42%, and New Hampshire: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 43%. Clinton searches are also leading 49% to Trump’s 39% in typically Republican states such as Texas. And it doesn’t stop there. Most of the USA is watching Clinton over Trump too – with far more watching the former first lady on YouTube Once of the most watched videos has been this ‘Women will be the reason’ video by the Clinton campaign But searches for ‘Vote Trump’ are ahead of ‘Vote Clinton’ What does this mean? Trump certainly has been louder during the US election campaign, but it looks like Hillary Clinton’s message is clearly getting through. The pundits have both candidates pretty much neck and neck in the polls, but this data could indicate that rather than there being a legion of shy Trump voters – as has previously been predicted – what we could end up seeing is a surge in shy Clinton voters – i.e. those who will not publicly say they are voting for Hillary Clinton but will do so in the ballot box. While this data doesn’t give any clue to the demographics of people searching, those shy Clinton voters could be the million of American women and other minority groups. What do you think?

Technically, Hayden reassigned Pallante to a new job in the Library of Congress, but Pallante rejected that offer and resigned. While we -- and some others -- pointed out that this was a good opportunity to reshape the Copyright Office away from being a taxpayer-funded lobbying organization for Hollywood, some folks who support ever more draconian copyright immediately jumped on all sorts of conspiracy theories about how this was really Google somehow firing Pallante, including one site that directly had that as a headline. To anyone who actually had knowledge of what was going on, this made no sense. Hayden is not connected to Google in any way. This is just out and out tinfoil hat conspiracy theory territory from people who see "Google" behind any policy they dislike. It seemed rather obvious that, like just about any new CEO of an organization, Hayden was clearing out some senior staff for a variety of reasons. And there was a pretty obvious big reason why Hayden would like to reassign Pallante: she has been directly and publicly advocating for Congress to move the Copyright Office outside of the Library of Congress. If you came in to run an organization and one of your direct reports was going over your head to try to transfer an entire division somewhere else, it's likely you'd fire that person too. It's kind of a management 101 thing. Over the past week, in talking to a few people at the Library of Congress, or close to it, this is the basic story that came out. Hayden didn't feel comfortable with Pallante publicly advocating against the Library of Congress, and used her role as the boss to remove her from that position. Others seem to be discovering the same thing. A report at Publisher's Weekly notes that the conspiracy theories are bunk: But multiple observers familiar with both the Copyright office and the library’s operations told PW that Pallante’s ouster was not necessarily rooted in any specific disagreements over copyright policy. Rather, it most likely was a matter of Hayden “getting the Library’s house in order.” Pallante, the sources noted, has strongly urged lawmakers to remove the Copyright Office from under the purview of the Library of Congress and make it an independent agency, with the register becoming a Senate-confirmable presidential appointee. “If Congress wants to remove the Copyright Office, it can do so,” explained one source, who did not want to be identified. “But, for now, it is part of the Library of Congress.” The source added that Hayden couldn’t be expected to lead the Copyright Office forward with a subordinate pushing Congress for the agency's independence at the same time. At press time, LoC officials had not yet commented Another close observer, who also did not want to be identified, agreed and said there was no shadowy Silicon Valley plot to remove Pallante and “jam in” a more tech industry-friendly Register, as some reports have suggested. From what I can tell, the "tech" industry was just as surprised about this as anyone else. Even the Authors Guild, which initially rang the alarm bells is now slowly, calming down and realizing that it may have overreacted. In an update, it notes that Hayden doesn't appear to have been taking orders from the tech industry. She also told them that she believes that the Library of Congress shouldn't be taking a major role in policy making: When we asked Dr. Hayden whether she intended to respect the traditional role of the Copyright Office setting policy without interference from the Library, she very clearly stated that she does not intend to weigh in on copyright law or policy. She said that policy and legislative efforts are the domain of Congress, not the Library. Her job, she explained, requires her to ensure that the Copyright Office has the technology and resources for the proper operations of the registration and recordation systems. She was sympathetic with our desire to see the Copyright Office receive the funding necessary to create a robust registration and recordation system that meets 21st-century needs. Of course, what's not entirely clear from that statement is if it means that the Copyright Office should also go back to its more traditional role of focusing on registering copyrights and similarly not weighing in on copyright law or policy. If she says that's not the role for the Library of Congess, then doesn't that also apply to the Copyright Office since it is a part of the Library? Either way, I know it's popular for some people to assume any conspiracy theory around "Google" must be true (and, just you watch, someone in the comments here will now try to rope this post and me into that conspiracy), but this one comes up empty once you actually look at the details. It won't stop the conspiracy theorists, but they can spin their wheels with their tinfoil hats, whiteboards and theories about sea creatures.

One way to get there is to follow the leaders. In networking these days, big cloud companies like Google and Facebook are at the top of their game. They run giant data centers, continually launch and modify large-scale applications, and don’t seem to be bound to big system vendors. Many ordinary enterprises would love what the internet heavyweights have: standardized networks that can support any application without administrators having to configure a lot of proprietary hardware. Conveniently, some of those cutting-edge companies offer parts of their technology to others through open-source specifications. But there are limits to how well a company in the insurance or machine-tool business can emulate world-changing tech giants. It turns out no one can just become Google, at least not overnight. Here are five things that most enterprises can’t actually do to become like the Internet giants, followed by five things they can. 1. Have special equipment built just for their networks Companies like Google and Facebook design their own gear and hire manufacturers in Asia to build it. They need so many switches, servers and other devices that this custom gear is made in high volume and competes on cost with ordinary products. Only a handful of enterprises are big enough to do that. Have you ever spooled out 950 miles of cable for one data center, like Facebook does? 2. Attract the best and most adventurous network engineers – a lot of them Practically every IT shop can make an argument for why a bright young engineer should come work for them, but no bank or farm-equipment company is quite Amazon or Microsoft. Being where some of the hottest technologies are born is a big draw for talent, and this pays dividends. An army of top engineers comes in handy when you want to build a cutting-edge network. “There’s a tremendous battle for talent right now,” says IDC analyst Brad Casemore. 3. Only acquire companies with similar cultures and approaches to technology At the big internet companies, acquisitions are usually tech startups. The fit may not always be perfect, but their cultures tend to be similar and their technology modern. The employees who come with these companies often are used to working on new technologies and ready to quickly change direction. Some become the network engineers who help make web giants hum. By contrast, mainstream enterprises often buy companies that come with legacy systems and IT staff who have a hard time getting used to new technologies, says Nick Lippis, co-chairman of the Open Networking User Group (ONUG). 4. Standardize and automate all IT systems Companies like Google keep their maintenance overhead low with a top-down approach to IT, migrating all applications to the same computing and networking platforms. “They standardize ruthlessly ... and then then automate dogmatically,” said Gartner analyst Joe Skorupa. Their vast technical teams, plus that focus on buying young companies, help make this possible. By contrast, some ordinary enterprises have thousands of applications to deal with and require 100 people to sign off on a project before it can happen, Lippis says. It’s much harder to use the same technical approach across the board in such companies, so it could take years to gain the full efficiencies that come from SDN (software-defined networking) and policy-based networking. 5. Base everything on open hardware and software Efforts like the Open Compute Project’s networking initiative have created a fledgling ecosystem for finished products that are open. But even though you no longer have to design and code everything yourself just to escape the proprietary world, it’s still more than average IT departments can do, some analysts say. “Most enterprises would struggle with this,” IDC’s Casemore said. Though the movement has produced some hardware and software products that are designed for mixing and matching, this is still a work in progress. “I don’t think they’ve put together the right packages, to this point,” Casemore said. The good news Though the stars aren’t aligned for network automation in enterprises as much as they are at the webscale giants, it’s not as if average companies are powerless. There are steps they can take to get some of the benefits of the next generation of networking, analysts say. 1. Start small Implement new technologies on the sidelines, where engineers can learn and the benefits can be proven. “Carve off new projects, and that’s where you introduce the innovation,” Gartner’s Skorupa says. For example, if you set up a new Hadoop cluster, try buying Hewlett Packard Enterprise switches with software from SDN startup Cumulus Networks just for that implementation. If it works in one place, it may later become a candidate for enterprisewide deployment. 2. Broaden your horizons If you’re dependent on one network vendor, diversify. Big network vendors say they want to partner with their customers, but that attitude actually shortchanges enterprises, Skorupa says. By keeping blinders on, they miss opportunities to save money and buy products that might be better for them. “When they define themselves in terms of their vendor, that’s something a hyperscale guy would never do,” he said. Cloud companies define themselves by the services they deliver and then find the best vendors to support those. Though juggling two vendors is harder in networking than in computing, it’s worth it for the leverage, Skorupa said. 3. Explore new approaches that go part of the way While going completely agile, white-box and software-defined may be beyond an average company’s abilities, there are technologies that offer some of the benefits without all the headaches. For example, Arista Networks sells switches with some white-box benefits, like standard hardware and lower cost, but with service and support included so enterprises aren’t on their own. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s Altoline switch family is approved by OCP and can be ordered with OSes from Cumulus or Pica8. An open installation environment allows for other OSes, too. 4. Try some easier automation tools There are also software products that can bring automation to networks from brand-name vendors. These systems take policies based on an enterprise's intent and automatically translate them into code or CLI commands for network devices from multiple vendors. This can be a way around having to hire all those ace developers being lured away by webscale companies, ONUG co-chairman Lippis said. For example, the Apstra Operating System, from the Silicon Valley startup Apstra, can work with equipment from Cisco, HPE, Juniper Networks, OCP and others. It includes telemetry to detect and report on whether the network is really carrying out the intended policies. 5. Get the CEO on your side. Standardizing and automating a network is easier with fewer applications, and all these efforts require hard choices that some people won’t be happy with. Be prepared for them to fight change all the way up the chain of command, Skorupa says. To keep individual departments from blocking network evolution, you need an ally at the top.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google is rolling out RCS, the successor to SMS, on the Sprint network Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsNovember 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google has quietly shut down the Google Showtimes website and brought some of its features over to Google Search. It's not known exactly why the company shut down Showtimes, but it's likely it wasn't making much money from the service.More In a mobile world full of capable messaging apps such as Allo, Snapchat, Line, WeChat, and others, plain old text messaging seems a bit antiquated by comparison. Due to the technological constraints imposed by simple messaging service (SMS), the cellular standard which powers basic text messaging, cellular messaging lacks support for the sort of animations, videos, and stickers which most clients boast. But that’s about to change. On Friday, Google announced that it will begin rolling out an advanced texting standard called rich client messaging, or RCS, to Android phones on the Sprint network. RCS is best described as text messaging on steroids — basically, it’s a modernized version of SMS that brings the aging standard up to par with clients like iMessage and Facebook Messenger. It supports features like group chats, read receipts (timestamps that indicate when a message has been received and seen), high-resolution photo sharing, and typing indicators (the animations that indicate when chat participants are pecking out sentences). It can transmit images and videos up to 100 times larger than multimedia text messaging, the outgoing standard that currently performs that legwork. And it features robust support for group messaging, including the ability to name groups, add new members, and leave existing groups. Related: Google Messenger 2.0 brings unread message badges — on certain Android devices The upgrade will begin in earnest later this year. Sprint subscribers with Android devices running KitKat 4.4 will see RCS become available in the coming weeks, provided they’ve installed Google’s Messaging application from Android’s Play Store app market and selected it as their default messaging app. Select LG and Nexus phones, meanwhile, will be “automatically upgraded” to RCS through a forthcoming app update. And owners of Google’s Pixel devices, which ship with Messenger preloaded, will have access to RCS as long as they don’t switch their default messaging app to another client. Eligible users will be notified via popup message when RCS becomes available. From within Messenger, they’ll be able to toggle a few of the standard’s features including read receipts, typing indicators, and whether or not data’s used for messaging. Taking advantage of RCS won’t be nearly as complicated in the future. Beginning next year, all Android devices sold by Sprint will come with Messenger configured as the default texting app. Related: T-Mobile breaks the limitations of regular, boring text messaging with advanced messaging  The launch is the fruit of Google’s Jibe Mobile purchase. The company’s technology, which Google acquired late last year, forms the framework of Google’s Universal RCS platform, a standardized text messaging platform the company announced at Mobile World Congress in February. In a speech to attendees, a Google representative promised a “consistent” and “inter-operable” version of the RCS spec that would work with non-Android devices and integrate with third-party APIs and open source tools. Indeed, Google’s RCS ambitious extend far beyond the Sprint network. The company intends to bring the spec to other carriers in the coming months, though it declines to say which. But its hands are tied. RCS, unlike the messaging technologies behind internet-based clients like Facebook Messenger, requires support at the cellphone carrier level, and the uptake has been slow: only 49 carriers worldwide have adopted RCS since its debut in 2007. (A notable holdout in the U.S. is Verizon, the nation’s largest cellular provider.) Worse yet, fragmentation is beginning to emerge: many of those carriers are on an older version of RCS that’s only partial compatibility with the flavor that Sprint and others plan to implement. Related: Google aims to beef up text messages with open source system And then there’s the elephant in the room: Google’s own internet-based messaging platforms, all of which eschew support for RCS in favor of older or proprietary alternatives. Google’s new Allo client, which comes pre-installed on Pixel phones, lacks robust support for cellular messaging. And Hangouts, the company’s all-in-one messaging client, has yet to implement RCS. But all the same, the search giant appears committed, at least in part, to moving toward the promised future of RCS: platform-agnostic advanced text messaging. “[Text messaging] is one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication today, used by billions of people worldwide,” Amir Sarhangi, head of Google’s RCS efforts, wrote in a blog post. “We’re excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the U.S.” Messaging Showdown: WhatsApp vs. iMessage vs. Facebook Messenger vs. Allo Hands-on: Google Allo Allo and Duo news: what we know about Google’s all-new communication apps Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

By Conner Forrest | November 4, 2016, 7:39 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/iSergey More than half of the web pages loaded in the Chrome browser are accessed through HTTPS, according to statistics release by Google in a blog post on Thursday. Additionally, about two-thirds of the total time spent browsing by Chrome users now occurs on HTTPS-connected sites, and Google expects these numbers to continue to grow. For those unfamiliar, HTTPS is the secure version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication over a network. HTTPS is known for its ability to help defend against man-in-the-middle cybersecurity attacks, and provide certain types of encryption for web traffic. Google also announced Thursday that it was adding a section for HTTPS data in its Transparency Report. In terms of the percentage of pages loaded over HTTPS in the Chrome browser, Chrome OS users had the highest amount, followed by Mac users, Linux users, Windows users, and Android users, in that order. SEE: 5 best practices for switching your site to HTTPS for improved security However, this order changed when the report considered the percentage of browsing time spent on HTTPS websites in Chrome. For that metric, Linux users took the top spot by a large margin, followed by Chrome OS, Mac, and Windows, with Android users well at the bottom of the list. "A web with ubiquitous HTTPS is not the distant future," the post said. "It's happening now, with secure browsing becoming standard for users of Chrome." Image: Google The blog post by Google claims that HTTPS offers the best performance on the web and supports features like "credit card autofill and the HTML5 geolocation API that are too powerful to be used over non-secure HTTP." For companies that want to move their site to HTTPS, Google posted two FAQs to help them better understand the process.

If you're a webmaster, try using these five best practices as you make the switch. Google has also been increasing security in other areas, too. In August, the company added HSTS encryption to Google.com, and it added new phishing warnings to Gmail around the same time. In mid-October, Mozilla Firefox celebrated a record number of HTTPS connections as well. Apple also recently said that it would require HTTPS in all iOS apps by 2017. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google recently released numbers showing that more than half of the pages accessed in its Chrome browser were connected securely through HTTPS. Google also announced that it would begin labeling HTTP connections as non-secure, and provided a couple FAQs for businesses to make the switch.

These systems take policies based on an enterprise's intent and automatically translate them into code or CLI commands for network devices from multiple vendors. This can be a way around having to hire all those ace developers who are being lured away by webscale companies, ONUG co-chairman Lippis said. For example, the Apstra Operating System, from the Silicon Valley startup Apstra, can work with equipment from Cisco, HPE, Juniper Networks, OCP and others. It includes telemetry to detect and report on whether the network is really carrying out the intended policies. 5. Get the CEO on your side Standardizing and automating a network is easier with fewer applications, and all these efforts require hard choices that some people won’t be happy with. Be prepared for them to fight change all the way up the chain of command, Skorupa said. To keep individual departments from blocking network evolution, you need an ally at the top.

No, this isn't a reboot of the iconic British movie released in 1987 about the sexual relations between three people, Rita, Sue and Bob. It's about Google DeepMind's latest artificial intelligence creation, Alice, Eve - and Bob too - and their secret conversations. Yes, that's right, Internet giant Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind has created a version of AI with its very own algorithm which protects messages shared between robots Alice, Eve… and Bob.

Alice had to send a secure message to Bob. Bob then had to decipher the message, while Eve had the job to, as her namesake suggests, eavesdrop and decrypt the messages between Bob and Alice. The bots didn't have much of a head's up either. They weren't pre-programed with information on how to encrypt stuff, they were set to function failure and left to their own devices. The networks, Alice, Bob and Eve, subsequently created a generative adversarial network (GAN) between them. GAN basically means unsupervised machine learning, which is when it all gets a bit complex. Basically, Alice and Bob were eventually able to create encryption tricks that mean they could hide messages from Eve. This, according to a recent article in Big Think, is "a little worrisome." "Alice and Bob are the first neural nets who've kept secrets from their programmers. That we know of," the article says. On one hand, Alice, Bob and Eve are a remarkable development in the world of AI — on the other — the whole concept offers the possibility of a future in which robots will be able to keep secrets from their creators — humans — which could be used for more sinister purposes. ...

The machines were pre-programmed to find a way around the encryption, meaning they were given pre-defined alternatives to play with. Otherwise we would have machines making mathematical discoveries, which is just not there. Basically all these people keep fooling the public to keep the funding money coming in. Cortana is pretty much where AI stands in therms of actual thinking ability. Reply michael 09:17 05.11.2016 | 0 | Edit | Delete the frankenstein complex arises from its brief nap.
