Outside of Search, Google's main successes have been Android, which is the number one operating system in the world in terms of absolute numbers, Gmail, the second most used email client and Chrome, which holds more than half of internet browser market share and Google Maps, the one map that we all depend on.

AAPL 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of AAPL Peter Lynch Chart of AAPL It's clear that even its successful products have one thing in common. Their purpose is to drive traffic to Google Search, from where Google can make its money. As a matter of fact, Google Fiber, a highly capital-intensive pet project, started with an aim to dramatically increase the speed of broadband connections and also to goad traditional carriers to increase their speeds. All of this will ultimately end up increasing our search engine usage, which is what Google wants. With Google being the number one search engine, it's understandable that the company is doing its best to keep the lead by building an ecosystem around it consisting of all the things I just described. But in the world of technology, disruption is the buzzword, and when you are company commanding a more than half-trillion dollar valuation, it's better to have multiple revenue streams flowing into the company. If you can have them coming from different segments, that's the biggest moat a business could have. Google Bets is where the company keeps trying for those moonshots, but until now nothing substantial has come out of it. The wildly hyped-up Google Glass, for example, was a spectacular failure; Google Plus didn't manage to excite the crowds; and now they also have the highly ambitious autonomous car project that have other heavyweights like Apple (AAPL) in the game. What does Google have that works? Google has two important businesses that are not designed to drive search traffic: YouTube and Google Cloud Platform. YouTube is a predictable breadwinner for Google, but the volume still isn't good enough to turn it into a standalone reporting segment. Moreover, with Facebook poised to take on video in a big way, the number one free video site has something to be worried about. From here on out Google will have to fight just to keep its YouTube ad revenues intact, let alone expect any kind of significant growth. Google Cloud, however, is a different ball game. Although the company has been sitting on cloud assets for nearly 10 years and most of it has been used up for its own needs, the company finally woke up to the reality that cloud can be a big revenue driver. Unfortunately, only late last year did it get serious about this business unit and get Diane Greene to move from the board to head up the cloud division. With her experience and connections, she's already brought in names like Home Depot (HD) to Google Cloud. But cloud is a tough nut to crack because three large entities sit at the top and are already racing towards the $10 billion annual sales mark - Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM). Their robust cloud capabilities have given them double-digit growth for the last eight quarters while Google is still at the $1 billion annual cloud revenue level. Do they still have a shot at a big cloud business? Google's only chance at being a significant cloud player is to quickly get above $10 billion in sales as soon as they possibly can. Not only will it be a significant portion of their $75 billion overall revenue, but it will bring them closer to the leaders of the pack. The problem is Google will need to be twice as aggressive as Amazon and twice as organized as Microsoft in order to make sure that its closing the revenue gap with these two cloud providers. It may never have the broad offering that IBM has or have an edge in enterprise the way IBM and Microsoft do, but it can certainly go for volume the way Amazon has done. The top three aren't going to let Google get an edge without a tough fight. The competition is so fierce now that Microsoft Chairman Don Thomson recently told Bloomberg that he wants Microsoft to grow its cloud unit much faster than the current rate. Microsoft Azure has been growing at three-digit rates for the last few quarters, and if their chairman is saying that's not enough, you can imagine how critical this is for them. Read More Google is caught between a rock and a hard place, figuratively speaking. So now the question is: Is there still a long enough growth runway for Google Cloud to catch up to the other three and start growing alongside them instead of way behind them? What's the potential for cloud infrastructure? IDC expects the cloud infrastructure industry to to grow at a CAGR of more than 41%. Considering the growth numbers that Amazon and Microsoft posted in the last eight quarters, the odds are extremely high that rapid growth will continue for the next several years. "Public cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings are rapidly gaining acceptance among enterprises as a viable alternative to on-premises hardware for IT infrastructure. A recent survey of over 6,000 IT organizations found that nearly two thirds of the respondents are either already using or planning to use public cloud IaaS by the end of 2016. International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts public cloud IaaS revenues to more than triple, from $12.6 billion in 2015 to $43.6 billion in 2020, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.2% over the five-year forecast period." - IDC Gartner, another respected source, predicts that the cloud industry including infrastructure and as-as-a-service products such as Office 365 to grow from $175 billion in 2015 to $204 billion in 2016. "The market for public cloud services is continuing to demonstrate high rates of growth across all markets and Gartner expects this to continue through 2017," said Sid Nag, research director at Gartner. "This strong growth continues reflect a shift away from legacy IT services to cloud-based services, due to increased trend of organizations pursuing a digital business strategy." - Gartner But even at $200 billion, we would only be dipping our toes into this futuristic technology. Cloud adoption has exponentially grown in the last five years, but it is a very real possibility that companies that are being formed now and in the future will never need to set up their own infrastructure because they will have four big companies to choose from. Enterprises will also slowly move into public cloud as IT costs skyrocket and investors clamor for cost-savings in mission-critical tech areas. Or they could start with a hybrid cloud where they still have their own IT infrastructure but plug that into a public cloud and exploit the cost and convenience benefits. In fact, the problem is so widespread that Oracle CEO Mark Hurd recently said this: "CEOs everywhere are under intense pressure to cut expenses, including IT expenses, to boost earnings--and save their jobs." Global IT spending runs into trillions of dollars. In 2015, overall IT spending was $3.41 trillion. Though not all of that money will flow into cloud, it's easy to see how the cloud industry can potentially walk away with a lion's share of spending on data center systems (servers), software (CRM, as-a-service products) and other services. iyvCEJLsKU6aGFTNkNwi4f9ixGTQp6TloAo8mVk5More This segment's growth is far from over, but I expect the three current leaders to stay there for some more time, at least until newcomer Google gives enterprise and middle market consumers enough reason to switch over from their existing providers. But there are several problems that the company needs to overcome before it is a competitive force in this industry. In the upcoming second article of this series, I'll cover Google's challenges, opportunities, threats and weaknesses in its fight to gain cloud market share.

Google may Have Some Weird Plans Up Its Sleeve: Is Android Going To Be Replaced With Fuchsia? Google may Have Some Weird Plans Up Its Sleeve: Aug 14, 2016 By Reem In a strange bit of information that has purchased over the past couple of days, Google seems to be working on a new operating systems that is termed as Fuchsia. Apparently this operating system will also be an open source one and Google may be trying to replace Android all together with  Fuchsia. The big question is why is Google trying to make this strange when Android is at its peak of development? The ideas e-mail intriguing to have a completely new operating system working on our phones but we are not sure if this really will replace the OS in our current Android devices as well. Another piece of information that we are expecting to come up is the replacement of Google Chrome OS as well. Right now it is not clear as to what will replace the Chrome OS but people are speculating that the future may replace the Chrome OS altogether. This would be a good move to make one common operating system for Android and Chrome OS devices but whether or not it would be reflecting on our devices or if it would reflect on a new generation of Google based devices it again not clear now. The sources that has given access information are quiet reliable and have been known to provide correct information on the Internet most of them. A good indication from the source stated that the operating system that Google is now working on will be quite a lightweight who appoint the comparison has been made with Google home and on hub router which should be quiet convenient for everyone to use. Not just Jazz, it has been mentioned that Fuchsia will have support for 32bit and 64bit a r m cpuz and also 64bit increase breast species. This is really good news and if the efficiency of Android can be experienced in anyway on Windows it will save as a lots ofhassle of connecting an Android device to a Windows platforms although it isn’t really difficult at the moment. Right now you sham may just be another experiment for Google with it may not be successful VIT. Let others who are stones levels of Android has claimed that future may just be a good name for Android 7 which is expected any time in the future. The operating system has been around long enough to enjoy yourself to its uses and has proven to be quiet efficient although it has its own share of ups and downs. It has worked as developers Paradise because of its open source features and if Google continues to develop the operating system as an open source platforms then we may be able to see technical development that we might have never imagined even a year back.

Share Tweet Share Tags : HTC-HTC+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ It may still be a month or two before Google officially announces this year's new Nexus smartphones, but the devices are not exactly mysteries to us. Codenamed Sailfish and Marlin, the two next-gen handsets are reportedly made by HTC, and should have many common features. Moreover, it's said that they also have one and the same design (though in different sizes). Android Police today revealed live photos of what seemingly is the Nexus Sailfish - the smaller of the two upcoming phones, which should sport a 5-inch 1080p screen. The photos - included below - show a device that certainly resembles the alleged Nexus Sailfish spotted in previously leaked renders. Admittedly, these are not the best leaked images we've seen, but they're enough to prove that the Sailfish doesn't really look like any of the older Nexus handsets (and neither should Marlin). This particular Sailfish model that we can see today has a two-tone, black and grey appearance, obviously featuring a fingerprint scanner on the back, below the rear camera. A recent rumor had it that the Nexus Sailfish would be a plastic-made device. However, Android Police notes that both Sailfish and Marlin should be made out of metal (with glass possibly covering the top half of the rear shell). The Google Nexus Sailfish and Marlin will run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, reportedly featuring Snapdragon 820 processors, 4 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of internal memory. Unlike the 5-inch, 1080p Sailfish, the Nexus Marlin will probably offer a 5.5-inch Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) screen, in addition to a larger battery. Besides the Nexus Sailfish live photos uncovered by Android Police, we also want to show you another image of the unannounced phone, one that appears to be snapped from a promo video.

QWIKSTRIKE (Posts: 1161; Member since: 09 Mar 2010) I have the Nexus 5, and Nexus 6 O.G. and I ordered the Note 7 because of the smaller screen. Some of us like a bigger screen. Having a smaller screen, and mediocre brightness is a nay no for me this time around....Too bad because I love the Nexus software. I have the new 7.0 and love the snappiness of this on my N6. The Nexus 6p was my limit for a smaller screen size then the O.G. Nexus 6. When playing with it in the store it feels so snappy and responsive. I may buy it when the price falls and use it on fi to see how that service is. posted on 14 Aug 2016, 18:41 8 Reply 3.

Babadook (Posts: 175; Member since: 24 May 2016) When using one hand I have to shift the phone to hit the top of the screen a lot of the time. It's a hassle because of the length. More importantly the phone becomes too large in my pockets (shorts and jeans). There is only a finite amount of space and I'd rather not have to lug around a brick in my pocket with unnecessary bezels. Every inch counts. If you have the choice of small vs large, who in their right mind would choose large bezels? Makes no sense! (Side note - PA ads are still out of control. I accidently click one and Google warns it's basically malware, etc. Ridiculous). posted on 15 Aug 2016, 09:10 0 in response to #20 in response to #20 Hide Reply 35. VZWuser76 (Posts: 4435; Member since: 04 Mar 2010) You would've hated the phone I started out with. It was the size of the 6p (height and width) but about a full inch thick.

He wanted to be added to that list. Three 100m old medals in three Olympics, a brilliant showman and that’s before we get to the 200m and relay medals. He deserves to be on that list now.

You may want to read this as he knows a bit about things such as being ridiculously brilliant: “That was a fantastic performance by Usain Bolt, he slowed down and said ‘I’ve got this’. It wasn’t about the time, it was just about winning the gold and going out on top. I didn’t expect the race to unfold the way it did. “Gatlin got a great start but it was always within Usain Bolt’s reach because he is healthy. He has been an amazing ambassador for this sport and in creating a brand for himself and the Jamaican athletes.” Usain Bolt shakes hands with 400m winner Wayde Van Niekerk.

Her jump of 15.17m was good enough, beating off Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela, who took silver, and Olga Rypakova of Kazakhstan, who won bronze. Keturah Orji of USA finished fourth.

People ask me all the time how long my record is going to last. You never know. It’s always a joy and a surprise to see a world record.

Plenty of Jamaican flags in evidence too. Still, it should be all but full. It is the blue riband night of what is still - despite all the lying, the cheating and the corruption - the number one sport in the Games. For just under 10 seconds at 10.25pm local time, it will be the centre of the world. In fact, it’s a bit disappointing to see any empty seats at all. Justin Gatlin was well received yesterday in his heat but quite loudly booed tonight ahead of the semi finals. As you would expect, it’s quite clear who the majority of the crowd want to win the 100m final - and it’s not the American. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.52pm EDT 20:52 Rypakova, the champion from 2012, is lying third in the triple jump final. She doesn’t look happy. Maybe she’s a triple jumping psychic because shortly afterwards Venezuela’s Rojas records a jump of 14.98m, way better than the champion. Next up the leader Caterine Ibarguen is good for 15.17m - that jump is very strong, further than the one that put her into first.

Hard to see her not winning this one, or at least coasting into the final and letting someone else have their moment in the sun. USA’s Jenny Simpson goes off quickly and has a very small gap going into the second lap. GB’s Laura Muir, the second fastest at this distance in the world in 2016, moves up as we go into lap three. Dibaba looks comfortable though we hear the bell for the final lap, and she takes off breaking the pack apart. Muir and Hassan of the Netherland follow her to finish second and third. Simpson gets fourth some way back, with Sweden’s Bahta fifth. That was a second quicker than the first semi. That’s what happens when you have the best runner in the world competing, I suppose.

Bolt starts SLOWLY - that doesn’t matter though, he wins in 9.86. De Grasse follows him and has enough time to look round not once but three time as he comes in second. Yep, Usain still has it.

The top two from the three semis go through, with the two fastest losers getting a chance to finish seventh in the final. A surprise winner here could be China’s Xie Zhenye, a 200m specialist who recorded a lightning time in the heats. Ben Youssef Meïté of Ivory Coast will also be a threat. It’s the weakest of the three semis anyway. Scratch my predictions they’re rubbish, Vicaut of France with 9.95, who struggled in the heats, wins ahead of Meïté.

The top in qualifiers was Caterine Ibarguen of Colombia, the silver medal winner in 2012. Third in the qualifying was Olga Rypakova of Kazakhstan, the 2012 champion. The men’s long jumpers got drummers when they were introduced last night, nothing for the triple jumpers though.

Felix wins ahead of Miller, the surprise is the Italian Grenot who coasts in third and will go through to the final as a fastest loser/least fast champion.

The US veteran Natasha Hastings - the fastest woman in the field - lines up alongside the talented Aussie Morgan Mitchell. Let’s see how they go. Hastings goes off hard, sprinting away from Mitchell. It’s Jackson and Hastings leading comfortably in the final 100. Jackson wins it but they’re so far ahead of the others, it’s kind of trivial. Both women finish a shade inside 50 seconds. Jackson looks amazed at her time, a personal best.

It will include the former Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu. There are three semi-finals with the top two from each race going through along with the two fastest losers. Or if you’re more positive - the two least fast champions. As usual the commentator describes the athletes, fully grown women, as “girls” but just as I’m about to cry sexism he describes their fellow runners as “boys”. Touché sir! McPherson of Jamaica and USA’s Francis start the race as favourites. Adekoya of Bahrain flashes out of the blocks, and then McPherson sweeps round the bend. Francis finished strongly to win with McPherson hanging on for second. Zemlyak nearly got second on the line. Ohuruogu finished down the field, her 400m is over.

I was pretty drowsy after doing a load of night shifts because of the time difference and being shocked into clarity by Bolt’s performance. It was one of those rare moments that leaps out of the TV and smacks you in the face. Like Brazil being trampled 7-1 in their own backyard at the 2014 World Cup, or the first episode of Joey.

After the rain-sodden minor chords of Friday’s opening day of the Rio 2016 athletics, the Olympic stadium was transformed on the second morning. With Usain Bolt, the world’s lone through-the-roof athletic superstar due in town, the swooping stands of this ramped-up old football ground were re-cast into a fun, fizzy sun-drenched place, three-quarters full by noon and with a crackle of something authentically Olympian in the air. As Bolt emerged at 12.37pm to take to the blocks for his opening heat of these games, a huge rolling cheer erupted around the stands, a sound unlike anything heard so far. This was wilder, shriller, more to do with presence and stature, the pure event-glamour only Bolt brings to proceedings. He worked the crowd, shooting off into a practice start, then turning to applaud magisterially the Bolt-mania from the people craning from the bleachers. Everyone loves a star, just as everybody loves a little glimpse of something ultimate, some pure human white heat. There were huge cheers again as the face of the quickest man in history appeared on the big screen, followed by profound, gulping silence in the crouch for the gun.

International Business Times 8/14/2016 Corazon Victorino © Provided by IBT US In a strange turn of events, reports about Google developing a new operating system surfaced this week. The OS that’s causing a huge noise in the online world is an open source, and it is dubbed as Fuchsia. With its existence coming into light, there is now one big question that needs to be answered: Is Google replacing its Chrome OS and Androi?  It may seem too early to tell at this point, but Android Police did not rule out this possibility when it stated that Google could be hoping to replace the Chrome OS and even the hugely popular Android OS with Fuchsia someday. The tech site also indicated that there is also the possibility of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for devices like Google Home and the OnHub router, just like what Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches.  Google’s Fuchsia OS is making headlines because it is not Linux kernel-based unlike the multinational company’s other operating systems, such as the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts, among others. Thus, this means the Fuchsia OS could run on almost anything — from PCs, Chromebooks, phones and Internet of Things devices.  Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.13 -8.86 -11.66% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.89 -0.92 -0.82% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 775.39 -9.94 -1.27% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.48 -3.54 -9.06% Fuchsia OS originally surfaced from the project’s GitHub page, where it is simply called “a new Operating System.” Part of the operating system’s documentation states that it has support for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. Also, it uses Google’s Dart programming language, according to Engadget.  For now, the Fuchsia OS is just seen as another experiment from Google, and it is far from being officially released anytime soon. Google could be planning on using it for something bigger than what it has now. Nothing’s really been confirmed about Google’s new operating system’s use as of late. The only thing known about what Google has in store for it in the near future is, it could be running the Raspberry Pi 3, Trusted Reviews has learned.  For interested techies, you can check out the project on its official site, but you must know that only limited information about the operating system is found there at present.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Aug 14, 2016 at 6:20PM HBO's Silicon Valley portrays many aspects of start-up culture accurately -- including the sometimes-tenuous balance between the creative or technical skills that give a company its content and the business know-how that lets the company thrive. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Dylan Lewis and Chris Hill talk about why the founder of a company is not always the best person to run its operations and illustrate the point with a few examples from notorious tech companies.  A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 5, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Chris, one of the other things we wanted to touch on with this show and how it plays out in reality is the idea of the founder, the person who came up with this brilliant tech idea, not always being the best suited to actually run the business. Chris Hill: Yeah. It's one of those things that seems obvious, but at the same time, is easy to miss -- the idea that you need balance at a business, you need more than one way of thinking. We've talked about Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) a little bit today because Google is the fictional huge company Hooli. By the way, that's one of my favorite things about this show -- the names they come up with for the fake companies. I read in an interview with Mike Judge that that was one of the more challenging things that they run up against, when they're jotting down some fake names, and then they go and do the research and realize, "Oh wait, some of these are actual companies." Lewis: Yeah, you don't want to get in trouble there. Hill: If you think about Google before it went public, you have Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who are the guys who come up with Google, they come up with the search algorithm. Along the way, it is clear that they need "adult supervision." That's where Eric Schmidt enters the picture in 2001. He's an experienced older business manager with a background in tech, but Schmidt is really the business manager of the three of them, and he's the one who shepherds them through the IPO process, and through, really, the first decade of Google being a public company. It's interesting, when he left in 2014, Larry Page takes over, there's all these stories about Eric Schmidt giving him lots of credit, and rightly so, and saying, "Well, Larry Page has grown up, and now he's going to take the reins of the company." But pretty early on in Larry Page's tenure as CEO, I would argue that he brings in another smart, experienced "adult" who has a skill set that is not really his forte, and that's Ruth Porat. Lewis: Yeah, CFO. Hill: Yeah. Bringing in Ruth Porat was a masterstroke. I remember when the story broke that Google's CFO, a guy who's name I don't even remember, previous CEO, left. I remember we talked about it on MarketFoolery, and I said, "I don't know who Google is going to hire, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be whoever the hell they want." You know? (laughs) They're just going to look out across the entire world and say, "Who's the single best CFO who can help us the most? Let's go make that person a Godfather offer," and they did that with Ruth Porat. Lewis: And you look at what the company has done since then... Ruth Porat has, I think, steered them in a more Wall Street-friendly direction. They've also announced plans for share buy backs, and they have an authorization there, so they can opportunistically buy back shares. That's something that old Google probably wouldn't have done. They didn't really care much for what Wall Street wanted to do, they were off doing their own thing and experimenting and changing the world, which is awesome. But, as an investor, it's always nice to see them making some of these more shareholder-friendly moves. In the show, venture capitalist Laurie Breen says to Richard, "You've created a company that is too valuable for you to run. You should be proud." Hill: (laughs) Lewis: Which is excellent, and it really embodies this idea of... Hill: It's such a backhanded compliment. Lewis: Yeah, "If you have the technical skills for this brilliant, brilliant algorithm, and you're going to change the world... we need someone else to handle it." Hill: Exactly. And part of the fun of the show is seeing a character like Erlich Bachman, who's played by T.J. Miller, who is very full of himself, a little bit of a buffoon, but he does have his moments throughout all three seasons of Silicon Valley where he demonstrates that he has a skill set that is valuable and helpful to Richard and Pied Piper. Lewis: Yeah, and in the show, they allude quite a bit to the Jobs and the Wozniak, needing both sides of the business brain, and not just relying heavily on the technical skill set. It is not very often that you get a founder and visionary like Mark Zuckerberg who also gets the business. And even with Zuckerberg, he brought in some great talent to facilitate them becoming this immensely successful company. Hill: He's a phenomenal CEO, but I think he would be the first to say that Sheryl Sandberg, bringing in Sheryl Sandberg as chief operating officer... if you look at what she did before Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), very much a traditional management background, and this steady hand. And, not the companies need to go out of their way to cater to Wall Street, because there have certainly been a lot of great businesses over time that have largely ignored Wall Street and the wishes of Wall Street analysts, but I think it does send a positive signal to analysts, to investment banks, etc., when they see that type of hire, when they see Ruth Porat, who was hired away from Wall Street, or Sheryl Sandberg, with her background, or an Eric Schmidt. Lewis: And, I'm going to play devil's advocate here -- it doesn't always work. Look at what happened with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Twitter plays out very similarly to what happens in the show with Pied Piper. You have Ev Williams running the show, he goes on paternity leave, they bring in COO Dick Costolo, who had been hired in, he was not part of the founding team there, and he runs the company for four or five years. He brings them public to debatable success. The vision hasn't been clear, the results have not been great, and now you have Jack Dorsey, a founder, back at the helm. That's not all that different from what plays out in the show, where you have Richard Hendricks get unseated because they want a CEO-for-hire type person, someone who went to business school, has written case studies all of this stuff. His name in the show is Action Jack Barker. Hill: Jack Barker! Lewis: Excellent character. And they disagree on pretty much everything. He's very growth-focused, very "what's going to improve the bottom line and raise the share price and valuation of the business," and Richard is obsessed with the product, and wants to make the best technical specs. And they fight and fight and fight, and eventually, it plays out well for Richard. He gets his way, and they wind up, maybe begrudgingly, giving him back his CEO seat.

"A G+ profile is no longer needed to post a review," the company said. It's worth mentioning that the change may not be available to everyone just yet as it's still rolling out. This comes over an year after Google disconnected Google+ from YouTube. "People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier," the company had said at that time. "But weve also heard that it doesnt make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use." In case you don't already know, Vic Gundotra, the father of Google+ left the project as well as the company back in April 2014. He worked for Google for close to eight years.

The new OS, currently dubbed Fuchsia, would add to Google’s current operating system offerings, namely Android and Chrome OS. This wouldn’t be an upgrade or replacement for either, but rather something completely standalone. Where it differs is in the fact that Fuchsia is not based on Linux — as both Android and Chrome OS are… Android Police was among the first to really dig in — and dig up — some of the details regarding Fuchsia. First of all, the new OS uses the new Magenta kernel. That kernel is designed to work with everything from a desktop computer all the way down to the most basic IoT devices. This means that we could theoretically one day see Fuchsia running on laptops, smartphones, wearables, and even smarthome devices. The primary language used in Fuchsia is Google’s own in-house Dart programming language and the OS also supports Flutter to create its UI. This indicates that Google is unsurprisingly hoping for a Material Design look for Fuchsia. Google has yet to officially announce this new OS, but two engineers at the company have confirmed a few details. One explained that Google had decided to build Fuchsia open source from the beginning, which is why we can see it publicly. The other engineer said that things will eventually be officially announced and documented, but no time frame was given. For the time being, we can only guess what Google has in store, but it sure is exciting.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google pleads for YouTube real-name use 26 Jul 2012 68 Google, Privacy, Social networks Post navigation Previous: Black Hat – Smashing the future for fun and profit Next: Carly Rae Jepsen nude photos stolen by hackers by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Google has been trying, sweetly, a little pathetically, and ultimately futilely, to clean up the inflamed boil that is YouTube commentary, by pleading with commenters to use real names when posting. In late June Google introduced the first pleading nudge toward real name usage on YouTube, giving – not requiring, mind you – users the ability to use their Google+ profiles on their YouTube channels. Here’s a blueprint of the begging sequence, adapted from PCWorld’s rendition. (For some reason, Google didn’t ask me to use my real name when I commented on an Eddie Izzard clip to test it all out): A YouTube user attempts to comment on a video. A box pops up asking that person to start using their full name. The person’s name is taken from his/her Google+ account, since Google requires the real name of someone signing up for a Google+ account (unless you’re a celebrity, that is). After the “start using your full name” box appears, users can refuse to start using their real names. If users refrain from using their full names, another pop-up asks them to justify the decision by selecting from choices that include: My channel is for show or character. My channel is for a music artist of group. My channel is for a product, business or organization. My channel is well-known for other reasons. My channel is for personal use, but I cannot use my real name. I’m not sure, I’ll decide later. According to people who find themselves on the receiving end of such a request, Google next offers to help users review their YouTube content before their full names are displayed and makes clear that they can switch back to usernames at any time. After three weeks of this prodding, the verdict is in: YouTube comments are still a vile swamp. Rather than replicate a string of comments that would demonstrate the persistently speaking-from-the-sphincter nature of a lot of YouTube commentary but which would also necessitate the overuse of asterisks to avoid profanity, I’ll point you to a representative list compiled by Gizmodo’s Leslie Horn. The list shows that much of YouTube’s commentary content, regardless of whether it’s posted by people with real names or pseudonyms, remains, as Horn notes, racist, ignorant, creepy, underage, psychotic, incoherent, homophobic, and/or, to be euphemistic, sphincter-ish. If there is one argument against real names requirements, it’s that YouTube users such as the0nlyM3xicantSAG might not post entertaining commentary such as: You﻿ seem like you have 3 brain cells; 2 of them are wrestling, and the other one's eating glue. Of course, there’s been ongoing debate about online anonymity ever since Google+ banned pseudonyms for everybody except Lady Gaga and 50 Cent. Are real names really about promoting online civility and accountability, or is it more likely, as suggested by Next Media Animation in its YouTube clip about the Google+ nym wars, that real names are just a lot easier to sell to advertisers? I sympathize with anybody who wants to elevate discourse above the Greater Internet F**kwad Theory, an equation that goes like this: Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total F**wad. But realistically, for many people, there are valid security reasons for not using real names. A year ago, when Google first instituted its real-names policy for Google+, Kirrily “Skud” Robert collated a list of reasons why people prefer to use pseudonyms. As of July 25, 2011, he had received over 100 reasons from people who had had their accounts suspended by Google for name-related reasons. Here are some: “I do not feel safe using my real name online as I have had people track me down from my online presence and had coworkers invade my private life.” “I’ve been stalked. I’m a rape survivor. I am a government employee that is prohibited from using my IRL.” “I’ve been using this name for over 10 years in the ‘hacking’ community. There are a nontrivial amount of people who know me *only* by that name.” “We get death threats at the blog, so while I’m not all that concerned with, you know, sane people finding me. I just don’t overly share information and use a pen name.” “This identity was used to protect my real identity as I am gay and my family live in a small village where if it were openly known that their son was gay they would have problems.” “I have privacy concerns for being stalked in the past. I’m not going to change my name for a Google+ page. The price I might pay isn’t worth it.” The profitability of selling real names to marketers doesn’t even come close to outweighing the importance of anonymity to people like those in Skud’s list. Let’s hope that Google learned a valuable lesson from the pushback it got over its real-name policy. Let’s hope it doesn’t push past this current polite pleading with YouTube users. Let’s hope it never makes real names mandatory. Let us know in the comments below whether Google’s real-name plea has any sway on how you post online comments.

You have their name; ok, then what? Are you going to send out the YouTube police to do what? There are thousands of websites that successfully control their user comments. Many of them physically monitor their sites, or ask other users to be moderators, to which they get some kind of reward for their time and effort. What it boils down to is this, if YouTube is willing to put out the $$$$ to stop the horrid language, they could do it. Will they? I wouldnt hold my breath, until and unless a real competitor comes down the pike. Reply No Way says: December 25, 2012 at 7:29 pm With a name and a picture, you can figure out someone's school, address, work place, contact information… thanks to Google Maps you can figure out where their house is and have a nice picture of it to boot. And it's EVERYONE. Everyone has access to that kind of information including a lot of really bad people on the internet. If someone hated you and wanted to go to your house and rob everything you have or shoot you with a gun, the internet has all the information they need on a golden platter. If someone wants to harass you at work or at school, that's also available. If you're a minor attending school, some strange guy might show up one day to pick you up and say he's a friend of your parents. If Youtube really wanted to curb bad language, they'd just make a filter. It wouldn't cost a lot of money and filters are very basic to make. It's like everyone got a brain tumor all at once and forgot that there's plenty of reasons to not reveal all of your personal information on the internet. Reply aotearoha says: January 28, 2013 at 11:28 pm Our real names are not necessary over the internet. The world isn't filled with good people, a hundred percent of the time. There have been people who have hunted down people over the internet, through even just a photo. Killed, assaulted, financially ruined, harassment. Reply YouTube TRUTH says: August 11, 2013 at 2:37 am It's just making it not as anonymous anymore – if you're about to post a hateful comment and your full name is also viewable (and searchable) by the whole world, then there's less likely a chance that you'll do it. People don't want their identity associated with something that could make them look bad. That's why the internet's anonymous feature creates such flare and trolls among comment sections, forums, discussion boards, etc. So by removing this anonymity, they're hoping people will remove – or not post – their unnecessary negativity. Although I have to say, a lot of the youtube comments are really hilarious and sometimes necessary for the idiots who upload these videos Reply Charli says: January 12, 2014 at 10:07 pm There are very good reason for NOT wanting your first and last name posted all over the place. The main one is identity theft. A very real problem. 2nd privacy issues. 3rd safety issues There are nuts out there that would love to hurt/kill/maim someone they disagree with. Why should I have to give anyone my real name? It’s a stupid policy that may bite then in the butt when someone shows up dead because of this policy. Any there reasons for wanting it are bogus. One of the reasons I served was to protect our rights and one right should be to use our names where and when we want to. NO company should force anyone to display their real name online. For those not wanting to display their names on Google and other sites…look for mailboxes that give you the privacy you want. one is hushmail.com If we don’t fight back we’ll lose our rights. Reply bob says: August 27, 2014 at 6:11 am I can understand Google’s reasoning somewhat, since forcing users to use real names somewhat encourages them to be more civil. However, those who are intent on being douchebags in the YT comment section wont be dissuaded from doing so, and all it achieve is making politically correct posters even more insufferably politically correct. Having anonymity stripped does promote self censorship. This is something I’ve noticed anecdotally, and also recent studies show this also. Take 4 chan and it’s anonymous system, and compare it to reddits moderated system and politically correct slant and you have an immediate couple examples for comparison. As for Youtube, users reacted by calling themselves stuff like Iron man, Bruce Wayne, Gandalf The Grey and Peter Griffon, and continued being dicks. As much as I dislike people being dicks, I support their right to do so more than I support the right of google to get people’s personal information. Freedom of speech (as long as it’s not hate speech) is a human right, personal information is not a corporate right, only a concession granted by consumers. Reply mittfh says: July 26, 2012 at 1:15 pm There's another reason for pseudonyms (even if linked to real names): say your real name is John Smith. There are probably hundreds (if not thousands) of John Smiths on the 'net, but as pseudonyms generally have to be unique, you're more likely to find the John Smith you're looking for if you know he prefers to be called DragonsBreath online. Added onto which, many people have online personas that are different from their real life selves, and may have different personas for different services, based on the profile of those they tend to interact with on the site. Just as Google+ recognises that people belong to multiple different social circles, and content that would be appropriate for one group to know may not be approrpiate for another; the concept also exists across the wider 'net: you may not necessarily want your colleagues to know where you've been on the 'net during your spare time; likewise, you may not want your social circles to what you do at work. Reply HugeDick says: July 26, 2012 at 1:18 pm Pseudonyms are linked to real names. Where is the problem? You don't like it? Don't read it. Freedom of speech is good, and pseudonyms encourage the shy. By their words you will see them and by their actions you will know them. Nice system. Don't fix what ain't broke Reply Machin Shin says: July 26, 2012 at 1:31 pm Of course they could just make there comments work like the ones on this site. You know, how they annoyingly vanish into a magical realm and wait for moderator approval before showing up who knows when. I'm sure that will work great and encourage people to be nicer, or to just not bother commenting at all…… Reply Not my real name says: July 26, 2012 at 2:25 pm Given that anyone can set up an account using an email address and any first name and last name, how is Google to know what is real anyway? Surely they should instead use their acknowledged intellect to apply profanity filters to comments, in conjunction with 'bleep' robots that regularly scour the comments for undesirable/unlawful content. Forums and bulletin boards (remember them?) have always had some form of censorship – aka membership etiquette – so why shouldn't YouTube and other sites be the same. Reply denim says: July 26, 2012 at 2:46 pm It is all about selling real names to advertisers. Nothing more. A filter that rejects the whole post for just one attempted infraction would soon teach the teachable that only clean language works on that blog….duh!!! And who cares about the unteachable…do they have money to buy anything anyway? Reply @authorizedpants says: July 26, 2012 at 6:24 pm I had to link my Google account to my YouTube account so I could get better integration on my Android tablet, but it still only displays my YouTube screename. Why should displaying your “real name” be necessary for Google to sell your information to advertisers? It isn’t once the accounts are linked. I suppose it is easier for Google to have a customer facing message about using your real name as opposed to just asking you to link the accounts so they can make money off of you. Reply Charli says: January 12, 2014 at 10:09 pm Maybe what we need to do is let the advertisers know we’re not buying any of their products due to these policies. It’s what we’re doing over at Yahoo over the “improvements” they’ve force don us that make both yahoo groups and yahoo email not work. Reply EverWasThus says: July 26, 2012 at 7:12 pm People talk as if using “nyms” is new or that engaging in anonymous flame wars is new. FidoNet (not the modern telco) which predated the public internet by at least a decade experienced the same debate and always opted for “let the community handle it” and was globally successful. But even before electronic communications, there was and continues to be postal hate mail, anonymous threats and anonymous junk. Several times over the past years I’ve received completely unattributed post cards inveighing me to embrace Christ. Banning user names is simply an invitation to mildly more complicated trickery to create fake electronic identities. It won’t work and it does not good even if they somehow make it work. The tone and tenor of a community reflects the norms of that community. If people wanted to stop the twats, they would gang up on them in concert and eventually the twats would go away. But if you have a community made up of bunch of twats, leave them doing what twats do and join or create your own community. Reply Internaut says: July 26, 2012 at 8:54 pm This from Google; a company that allows anyone to set up a gin-mill style webmail (it ain’t Email), account using any name still available?! […] If people are forced to use “real names” just how will that be enforced? Will the user (I’m not one) need to provide government issued documents, a photograph and a lawyer notarizing it? Why not just get to it, embed those chips they have for babies and animals to effect recovery if lost, and they can just swipe their heads by a computer at any convenient ‘head swiping outlet’. It’s getting crazy-stupid. […] I prefer using a “handle” a term used originally when computer communications opened up. That was before the Internet and yes – there was life before the Internet. A handle, pseudonym, aka, screen name, or what ever it is being called this week, offers protection from stalkers, Trolls, cons, shysters, and snake oil salesmen… oh, and the neighbour, wife, parent, child, in-laws, out-laws and so on. [Posted edited for length] Reply Ellie K says: July 27, 2012 at 2:32 am I see the worst comments on YouTube of ANYWHERE on the internet, as far as arbitrary malice, hatefulness and obscenity. I have a YouTube account. I set the comment option to "approve before displaying". Not a problem as I have received < 10 comments in two years. It is a concern for business "channels" though. They could screen comments. Or prune and delete objectionable ones periodically. Why doesn't Google implement a basic NLP filter? Doesn't even need to be ReCAPTCHA. YouTube's user interface has never seemed all that robust to me. Google has been fussing with it a lot, recently. They need to figure out something that works, soon. Businesses, government, charity, schools, others, won't want to spend money to maintain a channel that has the feel of 4chan. Sometimes worse. Reply Seebs says: July 28, 2012 at 12:14 am Yeah, not seeing any non-evil motive here. Remember when Google used to say their motto was “don’t be evil”? They appear to have sort of evolved past that. Reply Charli says: January 12, 2014 at 10:10 pm Money and power are always the roots of evil. Reply JG444 says: July 29, 2012 at 6:47 am What is the drama? If I don't want to give them my real name I will tell them it is John Smith. Are they going to ask for a passport or driver's licence to prove it? I like my privacy and if they wan't my real name I will go elsewhere rather than get inundated by spam from advertisers. Reply Jack says: July 30, 2012 at 1:55 am Who cares anyway? Those who don't care and those that do will do what they want anyway. I have always figured what I say is written in stone and anyone who really wants to can find me, can, so I restrict what I say. If they think otherwise, they are very ignorant and/or foolish. What if I pick a name like Joe Dokes? Will Google know it's created? Where will you draw the line. And yes I believe that there are many that fit into the formula of "Average person + anon…" will still be around. Don't sweat the small stuff. IMHO. Reply Sean says: September 12, 2012 at 5:38 am This is against the brands who have youtube channels on youtube. They already have ny video production that are active and the NBA will not change to David Stern according to what Google things. Reply Anonymous says: October 8, 2012 at 12:33 pm More accountability for less freedom of speech. I think I like it just the way it is. If I want people to know my real name I’ll go out to the bar. Reply rusureuwant2know says: December 1, 2012 at 7:54 am YouTube used to discourage the use of real names for users' protection. It's still good sense! Reply Chris says: December 5, 2012 at 4:13 am Anonymity is the only guarantee of the freedom of circulation of ideas. By forcing users to adopt a 'unifying' identity, it makes it easier for despots to identify and eliminate those that challenge them. Two Thumbs Down to Youtube for pushing its Big Brother Scheme onto users. Our society has been slipping towards fascism for the past 15 years. This is yet another proof we will soon have no freedoms left. It's high time those in government started to represent us, The People and started to reign in the Mega Corporations who are intent on taking over the world. Reply Xane M. says: December 6, 2012 at 3:09 am YouTube asked me and I felt like I almost had no choice as my name on YouTube, Xane Corp. Productions, had to be changed apparently to my name, as out of their reasons they had on screen, none fit me and now I worry if it was a good idea since I still prefer calling myself Xane Corp. Productions; THAT's another problem: Google should realize that people who felt forced to change were probably used to calling themselves their old username and/or their old videos said their username but then they changed it and then there's confusion in their fanbase/subscribers. Also, I typically call myself "Xane M." at blogs and stuff, not the name you see at YouTube now. Reply Anonymous says: December 21, 2012 at 11:00 pm Yet more evil marketing from that company that claims not to be. Google / YouTube really are bottom feeders. Reply Anonymous says: December 21, 2012 at 11:02 pm PS: the "because I don't give my real name to spamming cretins" was mysteriously missing from the list of reasons I was presented with for choosing not to hand my personal details to Google / YouTube. An oversight, surely? Reply Andrew Smith says: January 3, 2013 at 3:11 pm You already have control over comments. If you don't like them on your videos, shut them off. If you don't like just one, then delete it. Now as for videos that don't belong to you, those are easy to turn off as well. What you do is stop looking at those videos, then you won't have to keep bitching about what others have to say. Now I know, this only controls YOUR life, so all of you control freaks hell-bent on telling others what they can and can't look at, will probably not be satisfied with this, but hey, start your own video sharing website and you can control everything you want. Statists gonna state. Reply dfjad says: January 25, 2013 at 4:34 pm i absolutely wholeheartedly second that!! Reply AnonGuest says: January 8, 2013 at 10:56 am I wholeheartedly support pseudonyms on the internet forever. I wish Google would "get it." I wish they would allow them in Google+ and forget this nonsense in YouTube about real names as well. I don't think that people behave any better using a real name versus a pseudonym, although I do think that YouTube attracts a lot of young viewers. I think it has more to do with the demographics of a site and its commenters versus whether someone is anonymous or not. As for me, I killed my Google Plus account and if Google keeps inflicting its invasive policies, I will kill my Google account altogether. Reply AMAZED says: January 22, 2013 at 8:45 pm i’m reading this article (and others on the internet) and am just AMAZED at how so many people are willing to give up both their Securities & Liberties not for each other!

Reply dfjad says: January 25, 2013 at 4:32 pm i detest the idea so much and am so infuriated by the invasive popup that i’m not even telling them what i want or don’t want or why. i just kill the popup as many times as needed in order to view/comment/whatever. bastards. my identity and my motivations are none of their goddamned business Reply Bobo says: January 25, 2013 at 10:35 pm It's NOTHING to do with cleaning up the comments – it's all about tracking you and selling the information they gather to marketers. About the only thing google doesn't know about you already is your name and your exact address (thanks to your wifi SSID, if your street is in google street map, they know where you live to within a hundred yards or so). They track your ip address across any site that uses googlesyndication (which is a shed-load). Tie that in to your real name and it's a marketer's wet dream. Reply David Wilkinson says: February 9, 2013 at 1:31 pm I close the window when the popup appears. Are they worried about having trouble finding or identifying me? My screen name is my initials and surname and searching on Google (yes!) by the screen name finds material on multiple sites related to… me and only me, so they can’t say I’m hiding or aiming to deceive when in fact my screen name tracks me better than my “real” name. Idiots! Reply Nathan H5 says: February 18, 2013 at 10:01 pm Now it seems Google has gone beyond being nice and you are no longer able to post comments on youtube. It automatically removes you from the video page and locks you onto the change your name page and you are stuck there until you kill the page and have to look for the video again… Reply marius stranger says: March 18, 2013 at 5:29 pm i am using my real name on utube but google ask me to change it constantly and i cannot even post comment any more unless i change to a fake name i guess my last name is stranger but it is my real name however google do not accept it unfortunately it is not possible to contact google. my whole family was excluded from facebook for same reason Reply Rachel says: March 22, 2013 at 8:39 pm I've given up on YouTube over this stalkerish BS. Telling (not asking) someone to give you private information about themselves, then demanding a reason when they decline, then asking again and again and again for the exact same information that has been previously declined is stalking, plain and simple. Try asking any girl or guy that you work with for their home address and phone number. Then when they decline try doing it again every single time you interact with them. See how long you keep your job. It's hard to believe that even the greedy cretinous morons that infect Google's marketing department believe this to be anything other than a fantastic way to alienate users. Great job with that whole "not being evil" thing, Google. YouTube is yet another great product you've ruined with your greed. Reply ShadoMann says: May 6, 2013 at 9:59 pm They had the best search engine. They should have just stayed with that. Reply ShadoMann says: May 6, 2013 at 9:35 pm I am always civil to people online.

I don't need the Google Thought Police telling me how to behave and making me wear a name tag! Let's face facts: Google is in the business of gathering information …on you and me and everybody else. I would even go so far as to say they are dangerous. Reply Echos says: May 7, 2013 at 4:58 am I will stop using youtube before I let them bully me into changing my username. I cannot believe the way they are being so freakin pushy about it. I just don't sign in now and all though my comments are only thank you for posting I just won't participate in the comments anymore Reply Anonymous says: November 16, 2013 at 12:19 am You really wanna stick it to them, close your google+. Youtube actually does something. We should at least have the option to close our G+ acct and keep google drive and gmail etc. This is BS. Reply kendra says: May 22, 2013 at 7:49 pm I have myself complained about vile, racist comments YouTube's comment section but l wonder what makes YouTube believe that the person's "real name" is their real name at all. "There is not way to verify that real name is "real." If the real name is fake e.g., John Smith, then it is no more revealing of a person's identity than the pseudonyms most people use online. Reply CommonSense says: June 16, 2013 at 7:41 am Very true. I could say my name is Samantha Grey, and it's not. But how do YOU know? Unless I tell you. But either way, I don't like this pushiness. :( Reply Saffie M. Lowe says: July 3, 2013 at 1:25 am I post on several videos where former members of various religions have posted about leaving their religion. In certain parts of the world, apostasy is punishable by death. Should we ask those people to disclose their real names? I post about my atheism. I'm job hunting. Should I use my real name? Let's get real, being outed as [insert favorite hated group here] can be career destroying and life ruining. Swearing and vigorous insult exchanges are (like it or not) part of how humans communicate with each other. Where is the cut-off line, and who decides? Is it a moral decision? Is it personal preference? Is it paternalism? Is it snobbery? Is it prudishness? Is it thin-skinned? Is it being a nanny? What a can of worms to decide such things. The "F-word" is just a word. Is "damn" bad? Is insulting an idea the same as insulting a person? Is insulting a person the end of the world if not a crime? What happened to "sticks and stones?" What about personal responsibility? Can't a person simply block an offensive poster or ignore them? Done. There are tools in place already. The free exchange of ideas is not helped in any way by trying to be everyone's daddy. Personal threats and hate speech? Suicide declarations? Sexual predators? That's what reporting, moderators, banning and police are for (in serious cases and possibly impending crimes). And what of anti-trust laws? (Seriously, I don't know.) It just seems to me that these rule-the-world acquisitions create monopolies, stifle innovation, and compartmentalize the internet into the strong and the weak. What is REALLY going on here? Google wants to connect you so that it can refine its user profiles to sell more reliable data for targeted marketing. The excuse of civil discourse is a ruse. Of course I'm guessing, but admit it, something about this rings true, don't you think? Reply BW022 says: July 5, 2013 at 6:59 pm I'd rather put up with a hundred stupid, insulting, racist, etc. comments than silence one legitimate voice. A good argument or video can change your mind or make you think. That is good. Bad arguments, insults, racism, etc. can easily be ignored. Reply Osiris says: July 17, 2013 at 12:47 am The point of the real name is NOT for advertisers, but for spying. Google is run by the NSA and since Google owns YouTube they want to use YouTube to spy on Americans. They don’t know who you are based on your username and want your real name so it’s easier and can track that combined with your IP down to find out exactly where you live. If you speak anything horrible about the then Nazi Germany like occupation of the new world order in America, then they will be at your house to arrest you within 24 hours. They are still periodically asking for my real name, and if they do it again I may just take my channel down, and only use Google for search and that’s it. Reply joe bloggs says: August 16, 2013 at 11:54 pm Anyone using their real name online, particularly in any kind of social media (and that includes Youtube) is a bloody idiot. For one thing, as a UK citizen, my identity has to be protected under the terms of the UK Data Protection Act and neither Google nor anyone else has the right to sell that information to third parties. And don’t try to advertise to me online because I have NEVER once responded to any kind of media advertising in anything other than a negative manner. All spam in my mailbox will be deleted at source as I operate a whitelist that only accepts mail from people in my address book. Our rights and freedoms as individuals is being eroded more and more with every passing day and unless we stand together and fight this, then the nightmare world forseen by the likes of George Orwell and others will surely come to pass. It’s up to us to protect our privacy by any means necessary. Google, the NSA and all those other small-penised individuals who think it’s big and clever to mind our business instead of their own need to FOAD very rapidly. Reply Marvin Ruffin says: September 14, 2013 at 9:31 am If you think that Google cares about the civility of the comments section you are failing to realize the obvious. Google is not a person that cares about such things. It is a business. Anything that it does will be about increasing its bottom line. There's nothing odd about that, its capitalism. It wants its products (google+ it seems in this case) to make revenue. Integrating does just that. You can drop all the f-bombs you want, as long as you are clicking on those advertisements. But yea, the crap is annoying. Reply Wallawalla says: October 19, 2013 at 1:41 am Google's real-name plea has no sway on how I post comments. I don't use my real name. I also don't subscribe to the hate-filled regurgitation that so many seem to relish in. Cleaning up is a bogus excuse. Google could easily stop this. They could also, just as easily, make Youtube a place to respectfully agree to disagree, if they wanted to. Simple, even to a lay person. Instead of setting boundaries of respect [remember what that is?], they sit back and watch, allowing what amounts to the vilest attacks and most extreme comments seen on the internet. As another noted, forums have always had some form of censorship – aka membership etiquette – so why doesn't YouTube. It's not rocket science. If they enforce real-name use, I will finally be pushed to part ways & say good riddance. Reply Ima Gettlost says: October 22, 2013 at 4:20 pm Just make up a name to use. If it's a 'real' name they require, why not give them one? Like Ima Gettlost? Reply @area133 says: October 25, 2013 at 5:39 pm Google is deluded. Privacy is one of things you don’t appreciate until it no longer exists. We already have a massively censored news delivery system. How much worse do you want it? When they line people up against the wall and start shooting them in 20 years – it’ll be because of something you wrote using your ‘real name’ a long time ago. That’s a pessimistic outlook, but not an impossible outcome. Reply @area133 says: October 25, 2013 at 5:39 pm And it has nothing to do with language. It has to do with the suppression of political ideas. Reply Only1Tottenham says: November 7, 2013 at 1:54 am I certainly wont succumb to their bullying. I just keep deleting the prompt requests that appear. Sod 'em…!!! Reply Samuel Lourenço says: November 9, 2013 at 8:20 pm Well, YouTube is enforcing real names now. It I'm to post a comment, I must choose my real name to do it. Guess I'll leave youtube. Reply Anonymous says: November 28, 2013 at 5:18 am I think Google is wrong for wanting to clean up YouTube commentary — assuming that even is one of their goals. So, people say ignorant things sometimes. Free expression is healthy, sticks and stones may break my bones, and the easily offended should take personal responsibility for their own emotional sensitivity. After all, we all know we’re not going to put an end to bigotry by simply censoring it. Reply Stop merging everything says: December 27, 2013 at 9:37 pm With the increase of ease and creepiness of stalker cases, pedophilia and the like, its completely idiotic to hear Google wants to INCREASE this ease. Why don’t we just start signing in with our SIN? RETARDS. Anonymity not only provides privacy and security, and it also allows for 100% honesty. Thats where the world should be headed. I would not be surprised if the NSA is partnered with Google, what a perfect highly unsuspecting way to snoop even more. I severely doubt that a real name thing would be for individual marketing. If any execs are reading this I’m letting you know I would be LESS likely to go back to your website if you bombard me with your stupid ads, and flashes that I don’t care to see. Often times, these ads are interrupting my videos, distracting from my main purpose, and most especially lagging my computer. So if there are others out there like me, that means more marketing = LESS revisits. Less hits = less business. I’m pretty sure this is opposite of what you want is it not? How about you let people look for things when they want something?? Reply ANGU RANSOM says: February 20, 2014 at 2:17 pm I think GOOGLE just want to make the online world very similar to the offline wall. when you want to give a public speech you must introduce yourself to the public and for sure the public can track you too. Reply Mark says: May 6, 2014 at 2:32 am Yeah google keeps changing my log on id to my name when i log onto youtube. They are starting to annoy my I am seriously thinking of deleting all my account on gmail google+ youtube etc I Dont like being bullied by the big corporation they make enough money without knowing my real name.! Reply shameongoogle says: July 7, 2014 at 12:51 am I don’t need a “legitimate” reason to want anonymity. I have a right to anonymity. No, I’m not nasty to anyone because fighting drains me emotionally and people are stupid. But if I want to comment on a video of a sexual nature or express a controversial opinion, why should I have to use my real name? I’d rather never post a youtube comment again than give in to this coercion. This is destroying people’s freedom to express with themselves. It is destroying discussion. And as for those sheeple who happily go and use their real name, I can only shake my head. FYI: They have officially made it mandatory. Reply Anonymous says: July 31, 2014 at 12:59 pm To Google: Just disable comments on youtube alltogether. The world will be a happier place after that. Reply Anonymous says: September 10, 2014 at 2:06 pm some idiots think there is no way for anyone to find out they posted a stupid comment. making death threats to say a leader of a country, they can have as much information about the poster to get them started on the quest to identify the person in a couple hours. Reply mahituna says: September 10, 2014 at 2:12 pm if you need to hide behind some fake identity to post a comment, your comment is probably not worth reading..what are you afraid of? It is probably the main reason idiotic statements are made in the first place…people are cowards, they may make a statement that the Marines suck, but in real life standing in front of 6 Marines they wouldn’t utter a word-heck 6, probably 1 Marine. Just cowards Reply Andrew Ludgate says: September 10, 2014 at 8:14 pm I go one step further: for YouTube-related things, I have a completely fabricated online identity, with a fake “real name” to post comments. If I get into a real conversation with someone, I’ll take it offline, and not clutter up the youtube comments. The thing about commenting on public Internet forums (including this one, which is one of the rare places where I use my real name) is that it is public to the world, and you know there are enough people in the world that someone will get upset at pretty much anything you may say. Using your analogy, imagine having a debate with a guy who says he’s a Marine, telling him Marines suck. Then imagine ALL Marines and ex-marines stepping out of the shadows, and saying “oh, yeah?” Now let’s move that scenario to one where the other “combatants” in the discussion may not be as honorable as most Marines — say, one of the individuals who reads a controversial post you made has a proclivity towards Swatting, for example. It’s more than being a coward, it’s limiting your threat exposure, just as you wouldn’t leave your entire network open to the Internet, it makes no sense to give away more information than you need to when broadcasting to the public. Sure, it protects the people who are hiding behind anonymity to say things they’d never feel comfortable saying to anyone else in public, but it also protects those who have something that needs to be said, without being at risk of reprisal.

Reply Real Name says: June 10, 2015 at 6:51 pm I agree that the youtube’s comments are a snakes’ pit, but I really don’t want to use my real name. So everyone can just look up my name and know everything about me? What kind of movies do I watch on youtube, how are my political views, etc. Not that I am doing something wrong, but I just don’t want people (and corporations) knowing everything about me. sory my Englsih no good. Reply Never here says: August 14, 2016 at 12:43 pm I used to work in Corrections with sex offenders and other adults with severe mental health issues that have a histories of assault, manipulation and other aggressive behavior. I don’t use social media. I subscribe to a number of Youtube channels but I don’t comment or use the thumb ratings, which that alone isn’t enough to know who someone is. My point is I keep a very low “profile” online and don’t use my real info anywhere it’s not essential. The info for my android phone is my deceased great grandma’s birthday because she was born so long ago that no one would ever guess a date that far back for someone’s info. Also have her birthday and gender for my email and the info labeled as private so it’s not searchable anyway. If “real names” somehow became mandatory by law or some such thing that it became a criminal act to not use your real name and info than I would stop using the internet right now and not look back, toss the smartphone and switch back to a “dumb phone” for calls and texts, which is most of my communications anyway. But being I mostly just use the internet for shopping and surfing a real name requirement is barely even a concern to me. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Google engineers work on Fuchsia operating system By Juha Saarinen on Aug 15, 2016 6:40AM Advanced-stage project spotted on Github. Google is thought to be working on a replacement for its Linux-based Android and ChromeOS operating systems, after an advanced-stage project called Fuchsia was spotted on the Github open source code repository. There has been no official announcement around Fuchsia so far, but three operating system specialists are working on it and have so far committed a range of components to Github. Five of those working on Fuschia - Adam Barth, Brian Swetland, Travis Geiselbrecht, Petr Hosek (who made the intial commit to Github) and Eric Holland are all presently engineers at Google.  Barth, Swetland and Geiselbrecht have in the past worked on a range of operating systems that including Palm and Hewlett-Packard's webOS, and BeOS that was once destined to compete against MacOS and Windows. Although the initial commit to Github was made in June this year, copyright notices in the source code license suggest the project may have gestated in 2008. Fuchsia currently has two related kernels: Magenta and LK (Little Kernel). Whereas Magenta is aimed at modern smartphones and computers with fast processors and plenty of memory, as well as peripherals, LK is a stripped-down version that is designed for small, embedded systems. Based on the Github repository and Barth's presentations, Fuchsia could use the open source Flutter high-performance user interface framework with Mojo as the interprocess communications layer and application runtime. Dart, a programming language developed by Google, is used to Flutter code apps, with a rendering engine named Escher taking care of graphics effects, using the OpenGL and Vulkan application programming interfaces. A range of userland tools for the operating system, including compilers, codecs and emulators have also been ported to Fuchsia. Support for Raspberry PI3 is currently being worked on. Fuchsia and its associated components can be built for Intel x86-64 and ARM AArch64 processor architectures, using the Ubuntu Linux distribution, with macOS in the wings. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

Paul Sableman / Wikimedia Commons CC BY 2.0 From the most used search engine to dominating smartphone operating system, Google really has a big appetite in providing every bit of our digital needs. So it is no surprise that Google created a division that is dedicated to provide ultra-fast internet to your home -- it's called Google Fiber. Advertisement This service is currently limited to certain states, but permissions on testing the service in several locations across the country is ongoing. Google's new filling for testing to 24 more locations was approved by the Federal Communications Commission. This authorization from FCC allows Google to conduct testing in the following key locations in the following states: California, Colorado, Kansas, Omaha, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Currently, Google Fiber can be enjoyed in Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; Provo, Utah and Kansas City, Kansas. Google, together with parent company Alphabet, aims to broadcast wireless broadband internet connection on a nationwide scale. Google Fiber intends to deliver a similar bandwidth experience with fiber optics but wirelessly. This can be achieved through the combination of Google Fiber's resources and Webpass' existing high-speed wireless technology after its acquisition last summer. Google claims that media consumption like watching high definition movies and streaming music using Google Fiber will be seamless. Google could also upgrade existing Google services if they could provide a high bandwidth to their consumers. Advertisement The testing will be noncommercial and participants of the location based testing will come from a pool of Google employees, local contractors and trusted unpaid volunteer homes. Google envisions to revolutionize your internet experience by converting every city into a "Fiber City" that could keep up with the high demand for speed of every home and business in the United States. However,Google did not mention in their announcements any plans to expand their internet services overseas.

The wireless transmission technology is already being tested in Kansas City, which is one of the locations where Fiber service is offered, and Google wants permission to expand. According to the redacted FCC filing, Google wants to use "experimental transmitters" in around two dozen locations, including several cities in California and North Carolina, as well as Provo, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Reston, Virginia. The wireless transmitters would operate in the 3.4GHz to 3.8MHz frequency range, which is why Google needs permission from the FCC. "Authority to operate in this range will ensure that Google has access to sufficient spectrum for experimentation while avoiding interference to incumbent operations, including federal government operations and operations under Parts 25 and 90 of the Commission's rules," Google states in its filing. Why focus so heavily on wireless? It's a costly endeavor to both lay fiber-optic pipelines where needed and connect them to homes and businesses, the latter of which is known as the "last mile" of an Internet connection. One way Google reduces costs of deployment (and decides which areas to focus on) is by using a city's existing infrastructure rather than building out from scratch. Going wireless should be much less expensive to roll out, but it's only viable if Google can consistently establish fast and reliable connections that are on par with wired solutions. These tests that Google wants to run in various locations would help determine that, as well as let the company know where it needs to focus its efforts on fine tuning the technology. It's also worth pointing out here that Google announced the acquisition of Webpass two months ago for an undisclosed sum. Webpass is a point-to-point wireless Internet firm that's been in operation for around 13 years serving up Internet connectivity in five regions using wireless transmissions.

Home Radio Video Audio The Andrew Carrington Hitchcock AFP Show Archives Free Stuff Support Store Subscribe About Login Government Escalates Surveillance of What You Say, Read on the ’Net August 14, 2016   AFP   1 Comment • Industry, watchdogs resist expansion of ultra-secretive, powerful surveillance program. By Shane Smith — When using the Internet, most people probably have an implicit understanding that there is, somewhere, some anonymous federal agent sitting inside some anonymous federal building, tracking and recording the websites we visit, the emails we send, and generally everything we do online. And while the Internet has been revolutionary in its ability to break the information stranglehold that the political class held before the advent of the World Wide Web, governments around the world have eagerly developed extensive networks to spy on anyone they wish. Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More . . . When exposed, this spying tends to rankle the tech companies drafted into the federal government’s army of snoops, and in response, several companies have released transparency reports to inform the public how often governments request information and the specific nature of the request. What those reports reveal, while not all that surprising, should alarm us nonetheless. Place your ad here Loading… A new report by Internet giant Google on the requests it receives from governments and courts to hand over user data reveals much about the activities of the surveillance state and its relationship with the tech giant. The report shows that for 2015, 40,677 requests for user data were made. For 2014, the number of requests reached 35,365. The number of requests has tracked upward each year since Google began releasing the reports in 2009. Of all the governments that have requested data, the United States makes up 79% of those requests that have yielded data, far and away the state that makes the most user data requests. The requests made by the U.S. government take the form of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests, National Security Letters (NSLs) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and requests from other law enforcement organizations. Google isn’t allowed to share the specific number of FISA requests it receives; it can only share a range of requests. For example, from January to June 2015, between 500 and 999 content requests were made under FISA. The same goes for NSLs; Google can only share a range of NSLs received, not an exact number. Information on law enforcement data requests, however, is much more specific, with data on subpoenas, wiretap orders, and other information disclosed. The good news—if there can be any—in Google’s transparency report is that, while user data requests are increasing, the gap is widening between the requests and Google’s compliance with them. But that probably doesn’t mean too much, considering that Google, along with Amazon, complies with government requests for user data far more often than does Apple. According to Apple’s latest transparency report, the company only gave requested user information to the government in 27% of cases between June 2014 and June 2015. That number is much higher for Google at 67%.   Amazon has a rate of compliance similar to that of Google. According to Amazon’s own transparency report, the company complied with around 67% of the 813 subpoenas they were served. Do we have a right to know when we are being spied on by our own government? Microsoft seems to think so, and filed a lawsuit over the matter in April of this year. The U.S. government, of course, thinks otherwise, and asked that the lawsuit be thrown out. According to a July 22 Bloomberg article, the Justice Department responded to Microsoft’s lawsuit by stating that the lawsuit has no basis because, it claims, U.S. law allows for interception of electronic communications without a warrant. But after dealing with thousands of government-issued secrecy orders that prevent Microsoft from informing their customers that they are being spied on, the company has had enough. Secretive surveillance of all our activities, online or off, should always be viewed as an outrage, as a violation of our liberty and not to be tolerated. But while several tech giants have been fighting the battle against warrantless mass surveillance of our online activities, should we really rely on these distant mega-corporations to fight this battle for us? After all, aside from Apple, they are complying with the surveillance state more often than not. The issue at hand is how much intrusion into our private lives we will tolerate. How much longer will we allow the hobgoblins of so-called terrorism and crime to be used to justify secret spying for unknown purposes? We are being conditioned to accept this as the new normal. Death, taxes, endless war, total surveillance . . . the new inevitability, perhaps, but more comparable to a prison than to a free society.

Oh, you heard that last month? Well, today Google hammered another nail in its coffin by making it possible for users to post reviews in Google Play without the need for a Google+ account. The change, which will likely be a help for many, is rolling out now to all users, so if you don’t have a Google+ account and can’t write reviews on Google Play, you should be able to in the near future. Related: Google Play Family Library lets you share purchased content with up to 6 people Of course, the move is just another directed toward unbundling services and features from Google+. Perhaps the most notable is when Google unbundled the much loved Google+ Photos to a new service, simply called Google Photos, which has fast become one of Google’s most loved services. Google also disconnected Google+ from YouTube comments, allowing users to comment on YouTube without needing to have a Google+ profile at all. “People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier,” said Google Vice President of Streams, Photos and Sharing Bradley Horowitz, in a blog post. “But we’ve also heard that it doesn’t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.” Google+ was first launched in 2011, and while it had some great features, it largely failed to capture the same audience the likes of Facebook have managed. It still has a small yet loyal user-base, however Google clearly wants to bring as many features as possible to the masses, which is why the company is bringing things like Google Photos and the ability to make reviews to those simply with Google accounts, rather than needing users to have Google+ accounts. The failed social media network has even been called the “walking dead” by Vic Gundotra, who left Google after heading up the Google+ project.

Since there are no official statements about the devices from Google so far, here is an overview of the rumored specs for the two devices. Google Nexus Marlin rumored specs The Nexus Marlin is believed to sport a 5.5 inch Quad HD screen with 2560 x 1440 px in resolution. Supposedly, it will be powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor and it wil feature 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of native storage space. In terms of camera, it is believed to feature two: a 12 MP rear one and an 8 MP front one. The Google Marlin is also believed to sport a rear side fingerprint reader for improved security. Google Nexus Sailfish rumored specs The Nexus Sailfish is believed to be the smaller version of the Nexus 2016 series and it is believed to sport a 5 inch screen and that it is going to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. Much like the aforementioned Marlin, this handset will also feature 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of native storage space. Supposedly, both versions of the phone will sport an Android Nougat Manufacturer Release 1 that will feature Google assistant and Android Pay. However, unlike the Google Sailfish, the Marlin will also have the Night Light mode which will enable its users to adjust light when using the phone at night. At the moment there are no rumors regarding the batteries of the two devices or their prices, but the Android Nougat OS is coming very soon and we won’t have to wait for too long to find out. LG V20 – the first handset to run Android 7.0 Nougat? According to an official announcement from LG representatives, the upcoming LG V20 will be the first handset to run the A. 7.0 Nougat and this one is set to be launched sometime in September. Which one of these do you think will be the first handset to showcase Android Nougat?

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: August 15, 2016 3:30 am The Google doodle showcases the Indian Parliament House, with Nehru at the centre delivering the historic Tryst with Destiny speech. As India celebrates its 70th year of independence, today’s Google doodle pays an homage to Jawaharlal Nehru’s historic speech in the Parliament House before the Indian Constituent Assembly. For most Indians, the words of that iconic speech from August 15, 1947, are permanently etched in the mind: “Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now that time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of today’s midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.” And awake it did. After almost a century of the Indian independence movement, this speech was the climax of hopes, aspirations, dreams, blood, sweat and countless lives. Today, India shares its Independence Day with South Korea, marking the end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945 — for which Google team has created yet another doodle. Called Gwangbokjeol, the doodle depicts the historic Sungnyemun, the largest castle gate of the Eight Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul. Just a day before, on August 14, there was a special doodle to mark Pakistan’s Independence Day featuring various landmarks from the ancient ruins of Mohenjodaro, including the stately “Priest-King”, a clay bullock cart, and the bronze “Dancing Girl”.

For quite some time now, it has been rumoured before that Google would merge it’s Chrome OS and Android platforms. However, this new OS is not just an upgrade to Chrome OS or Android, but is instead a whole new system that isn’t derived from the Linux kernel. Codenamed as Fuchsia OS, this new OS is powered by Magenta, which is designed to work across a wide range of devices from small “embedded devices” all the way up to desktops and laptops. Google hasn’t formally announced this new OS while the Git repository cites it as “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” Google is using Dart as the programming code for the OS, and Flutter for the user interface. The OS will support 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs, and also 64-bit PCs. According to an Android Police report, Google hopes to replace Android and Chrome OS with Fuchsia. But the caveat remains this might just be one of Google’s many secretive projects that never actually make it to consumers. Google’s Travis Geiselbrech, who worked on NewOS, BeOS, Danger, Palm’s webOS and iOS, and Brian Swetland, who also worked on BeOS and Android, are involved in this project, according to Hacker News. “LK is a kernel designed for small systems typically used in embedded applications.” reads the repository. “On the other hand, Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” According to Geiselbrecht, we should also see Fuchsia running on a Raspberry Pi 3 in the near future. Well, it will be interesting to see what Fuschia is all about once Google discloses more details and also see if rumours about Fuchsia turn out to be true. For now, Google is expected to release the latest version of its Android OS, v7.0, dubbed Nougat next month. The Developer Preview 5 of Nougat with final APIs were rolled out by the company in July, giving a near-final look of the OS. Share.

It's Olympic gold for Great Britain! So for the first time in this match, which has been going on for All Eternity, Del Potro is serving to stay in this remarkable Olympic final. So he might as well go hell for leather on the first point. He wheels into that forehand and grinds Murray down to lead 15-0. Murray wins the next point, doing just about enough with an overhead, but then he swipes a forehand return wide for 30-15. But then it’s Del Potro’s turn to fail with a forehand, the game going to 30-all. Murray looks like he’s about to win the next point when Del Potro drops a ball short. Yet he seems put off when some clown shouts out from the crowd and he totally messes up his drop shot. He stares at the crowd. If looks could kill. It’s 40-30. But not for long. Del Potro is dragged to deuce when he misses a backhand. The volume’s increasing and, just to add to the drama, an Argentinian fan is being ejected. Appropriately enough, he’s wearing a jester hat. Eventually he’s sent on his way, boos ringing around the arena as he leaves, and play can continue. When it does, Del Potro wallops a forehand wide. It would have been a winner. But wide it went and Murray has his first gold medal point! Can he take it? No! He nets a tight forehand return for deuce! But he has another chance when Del Potro, unnerved by a fine return, nets a backhand slice. Is this the moment? It is! Del Potro puts everything into a series of huge forehands. But he’s looking so tired. And this time he’s not kidding around. He’s dropping them short and Murray’s in the rally. He seizes control with a forehand into the left corner and Del Potro, on his last legs, can only slice into the net! That’s it! It’s all over! Andy Murray is the Olympic champion again! He’s in tears! Of course he is. He loves a good cry. And why not? No one’s ever won back to back Olympic titles in the tennis before! Andy Murray reacts after winning gold. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Updated at 8.20pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.55pm EDT 19:55 Fourth set: Murray* 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 6-5 Del Potro (*denotes server): Simple analysis about what Murray needs to do here: STOP DOING DOUBLE FAULTS. He heeds my advice. Yet it doesn’t matter when Del Potro pops a forehand down the line to lead 0-15. It’s happening again, isn’t it. Yep. It’s 0-30 when Del Potro swings at a forehand off a second serve, forcing Murray to miss a backhand. Murray looks exasperated. Then it’s Del Potro’s turn to hold his head in his hands. A forehand’s called long. The umpire overrules it. Murray challenges. It was in! They’ll have to replay the point and Murray, who’s out of challenges, has a first serve. He wins the point at the net to make it 15-30. But he’s not out of the woods yet, far from it, especially when Del Potro sees a fine Murray approach and punches a wondrous backhand down the line out of nowhere to bring up two break points. I doubt Murray wants to see his serving stats from this set. They must make for grim reading. Yet just when you think it’s done, you forget that this is Andy Murray’s world and nothing ever makes sense. Del Potro squanders the first break point with a netted backhand. Murray saves the second with an ace. But of course. Barely able to make a serve throughout the set, then he does that. Another ace brings up game point and Murray holds when Del Potro nets a backhand. He’s a game away from the gold medal. Mind you, I quite want to see how ridiculous a tie-break between these two would be. Hubert O'Hearn (@BTBReviews) @JacobSteinberg Tennis? Wow, this is more like the Ali-Frazier Rumble in the Jungle. What an epic match. #OlympicTennis August 14, 2016 Andy Murray fights his way back into the fourth set. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images Updated at 8.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47pm EDT 19:47 Fourth set: Murray 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 5-5 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Serving to force an unlikely fifth set, Del Potro throws everything at Murray. But it’s superb defence from Murray, who wins the point when Del Potro gets jittery with a forehand for 0-15. Murray’s got another 0-30 lead when Del Potro nets a backhand slice. He looks tired. Then again, he always looks tired. He could sleep for a year and emerge looking tired. Part of the charm. He looks even more knackered after winning the next point with an overhead for 15-30. Yet Murray earns two break points, hurting Del Potro with a splendid backhand down the line. Del Potro’s response? He saves the first with a preposterous forehand drop shot. Even Murray’s not making that one. He can live with that. He can’t abide what he does with the second break point, though, needlessly netting a backhand. He’s happier after the next point, a stunning, seesawing rally that ends with Del Potro blocking a forehand wide after Murray goes for a backhand down the line. Here comes a third break point. Here comes a huge serve. Here’s deuce. But Murray carves out a fourth opportunity. He drop shots and although Del Potro gets there, he rams a forehand past him. And the pressure tells. Murray’s pumping his fist after Del Potro nets a backhand! He’s broken back! Del Potro is broken again.

He probably should have done that 10 minutes ago. The next two points are Murray’s as well, Del Potro’s forehand letting him down. He holds to 15. Del Potro will have to serve to force a decider.

Is it to be third time lucky? His prospects aren’t looking too clever when he nets a slice to drop the first point before spooning a forehand long for 0-30. Del Potro grits his teeth. He wins the next two points. Thirty-all. Then Murray nets a forehand return. It’s 40-30. And Del Potro holds thanks to a fantastic volley! What courage he’s showing here. Murray has to serve to stay in the fourth set. But. Well. “We really have been cheated by the Tennis Gods,” says Adam Hirst. “This is an excellent match-up, a really good and interesting game, as it would have been for Del Potro against any of the other three these last 6 years. Both players play well from the baseline but there is enough at the net from both to keep things interesting as well. Cracking stuff.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.28pm EDT 19:28 Fourth set: Murray* 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 3-4 Del Potro (*denotes server): The Del Potro forehand’s firing again! Murray needs to watch out. It’s 0-15. But there’s not a lot anyone can do when he hits that shot with this much venom. Murray accepts it, gets on with it and wins the next point with a drop shot and a sharp volley for 15-all. Mind you, Del Potro looks surprisingly sprightly all of a sudden and he’s got a 15-30 lead after another double-fault from Murray, who wastes his second challenge of this set. He’s only got one left and he’s screaming at himself. He’s even more infuriated after netting a forehand, conceding two more break points. Murray’s serve has gone to pot again. He draws Del Potro forward. But the Argentinian’s all over this drop shot. Murray tries a backhand lob but it’s nowhere near good enough and Del Potro breaks again with a smash! What’s up with Murray’s concentration?

It seems to have had an effect judging by the way he crushes a forehand down the line for 15-0. Another forehand winner makes it 30-0. A third makes it 40-0. A fourth sees him hold to love. Blimey!

He stunk the place out with both of his previous service games. But this time he wins the first point, forcing Del Potro to volley long. An ace down the middle makes it 30-0. But Del Potro still has some firepower left, ripping a forehand away to make it 30-15. That’s a warning shot, one Murray won’t want to ignore. Yet he’s rediscovered his consistency. He holds to 15. It’s the first hold of the set. And Del Potro hasn’t won a service game for a while. Juan Martin Del Potro struggles to hold his serve.

Now he’s struggling to locate his first serve. Bad news against Murray, who’s soon got a 0-30 lead, Del Potro netting a backhand. The next rally ends with Del Potro slicing long. He holds his left thigh. He grimaces. Murray has three break points. The first goes begging, a forehand going wide. But the low, spinning slice down the line does the trick. Del Potro stoops and nets a forehand. He looks knackered. But appearances can be deceiving. Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) This match is utterly exhausting - goodness knows how the players feel!

Then he splutters a forehand into the net and that’s 0-30. But Murray hauls himself back to 30-all. Del Potro misses a backhand return for 15-30 before Murray finds the line with a backhand winner. Yet Del Potro’s clutching a break point after a second double-fault from Murray. World No2, you say? This is preposterous. So’s the next rally. Murray tries to pass with a backhand from left to right. Del Potro digs it out from under his feet. Somehow. Murray manages to scoop it up but can only tee it up for Del Potro to plonk the ball back into the open court. Very strange from Murray. Del Potro edges ahead again.

Murray’s promptly given a warning for an audible obscenity. It’s no surprise he’s infuriated after that stinker of a service game. That spot of swearing seems to rouse him, though. Del Potro sticks a volley into the net to make it 15-all and Murray makes it 15-30 with a well judged backhand that draws an error from his opponent. A good, deep second serve from Del Potro gets him back to 30-all but Murray has a break point after returning well with a forehand. He chucks it away, though, putting too much into an attempted forehand winner, the ball dropping just wide. Then comes a discussion between Del Potro and the umpire. It’s not clear what’s going on but they’re friends in the end. On they go. And Murray earns a second break point, a backhand down the line too much for Del Potro, who can’t do anything with a volley. What now? Murray genius, that’s what. An absurd, teasing backhand drop shot, beautifully weighted, taunting Del Potro, slapping him in the face. What a shot. Murray breaks back.

His task looks forlorn as he takes up his position behind the baseline, ready to return, but it’s Murray who makes a dodgy start to the fourth set, losing the first two points with a couple of howlers, missing an easy overhead by miles, then dumping a forehand wide. He doesn’t need to give Del Potro any encouragement. But he’s going through a dip, netting a forehand to hand over two break points. This is appalling from Murray. Utter tosh. He butches another forehand, sending it way past the baseline, to drop his serve. Dearie me, that was awful. Del Potro didn’t have to do a thing.

Looking to stay in the third set, Del Potro loses the first two points with errant groundstrokes. Another mistake and Murray has three set points. He can’t take the first, dragging a backhand wide. So he takes the second, swiping a forehand return from right to left, as though it was the easiest thing in the world. He’s a set away from retaining Olympic gold.

He’s desperate to turn the screw. Del Potro turns up the heat on the next point. But Murray responds with some fire of his own, then scampers on to a drop shot and knocks a backhand down the line to lead 40-0. Del Potro musters some fight after it goes to 40-15, walloping a forehand return away for 40-30, but Murray holds to 30. He’s a game away from winning this set and re-establishing his lead.

Another one makes it 0-30. This is definitely a dull. But it doesn’t last long. Murray nets a forehand return, then finds that dastardly net in the way again when he goes for a backhand. 30-all, then. But Murray isn’t going anywhere. Del Potro tries to trip him up with a slice behind him but Murray adjusts ridiculously, turning and whipping a forehand pass out of reach to earn his first break point in this set. Del Potro’s response? An enormous forehand that forces Murray to net a slice for a deuce. Murray has another chance when Del Potro dips a hopeful slice wide, though, and this time he takes it when the Argentinian batters a forehand long. “Come on!” Murray wells, leaping for good measure.

They don’t know what they’ve let themselves in for. Imagine being a tennis ball, learning you’ve been given a Del Potro match, asking your mates what it’s like. “Oh, he doesn’t hit it that hard. You’ll be fine! Although, remember Gary? He got it bad once. Never saw him again actually.” Then they chuckle darkly. That would be a good idea, wouldn’t it.

Murray challenges but the ball was inches in. Murray responds by taking the next two points. He’s been using the drop shot well, variation that’s likely to be effective against Del Potro.

Then he rockets a forehand on to the line for a 40-0 lead. He holds to 15, volleying smartly. He looks very sweaty. “So if Del Po does win this, will he put it down to the “forehand of God”?” says John Hubbard. “Don’t think he will do it though - Murray has the experience and stamina to win in five sets if need be.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.21pm EDT 18:21 Third set: Murray* 7-5, 4-6, 1-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): I wondered at the start of the second set how much energy Del Potro had left. His answer was resounding. But it’s fair to ask the question again. How much has he got left in the tank? Because that was a monumental effort. For the sake of entertainment, you’ve got to hope that he’s not run out of juice. For Andy Murray’s sake, you’ve got to hope he’s feeling it a bit. Murray certainly has the legs for a five-setter. And he makes a good start to this set, moving into a 40-0 lead without ceremony. He holds to 15 with a fantastic backhand down the line.

Del Potro unleashes a series of murderous forehands. Yet Murray keeps repelling them and eventually Del Potro nets one to make it 0-15. Then Del Potro’s given a time violation for taking too long to serve. He stares furiously at the umpire. There’s a chance he’s going to aim his next forehand at the chair. He thinks better of it, though, and this time manages to outlast Murray, who nets a forehand for 15-all. Soon it’s 30-15, Del Potro finding enough power and width to force Murray to hoick one long. He’s two points from levelling this now. Make that one point. Murray charges the net but Del Potro picks him off with a backhand down the line to earn two set points. He can’t take the first, though, peeling back and netting a forehand to make it 40-30. Murray’s still alive here, just about. And he’s properly in this game when he gives Del Potro some of his own medicine, upping the pace of his forehands, making it deuce when the Argentinian sends a rather desperate forehand long. Work to do here for Del Potro ... who promptly bangs an ace down the middle to earn a fourth break point. Or has he? Murray challenges ... and it was out by 0.0000001mm. Del Potro maintains his composure, however, and he does earn that fourth set point in the end, rasping a forehand out of reach. This is a truly special match. And we’re going to have at least two more sets: Del Potro’s had enough of Murray’s demented resistance, tearing a forehand down the line to take the second set! You can’t say he’s not deserved it.

Del Potro’s on fire at the moment and another miss from Murray makes it 0-30. Del Potro is hitting it so deep and it’s throwing Murray’s balance. Two wasteful forehand misses from Del Potro allow Murray back in at 30-all but the Argentinian has a set point when the world No2 tamely nets a forehand. Murray decides now’s the time to drop shot. Badly. Del Potro gets there. He goes right at Murray – who adjusts incredibly to prod a backhand past him for deuce. Oof, that was close. Soon Murray has a game point. He thinks he’s nailed an ace. Apparently it kissed the top of the net. He disagrees with the umpire but there’s not much he can do beyond getting on with winning the point. Which he does when Del Potro nets a forehand.

He doesn’t really mean it, of course, he’ll take those all evening. Also in his favour: his first serve. He’s got 89% of them in during this set, a remarkable effort. And he’s in charge at the moment. More huge groundstrokes help him into a 40-15 lead. A blistering forehand is enough for him to hold. He almost took Murray’s arm off with that one.

He redeems himself with a forehand pass from right to left for 15-all. Another forehand winner makes it 30-15. He holds to 15 thanks to a couple of misses from Del Potro, who wastes a challenge on the second one. “Arguably the quality that Leyton Hewitt brought to top level tennis as much as anyone was sheer bloody-mindedness,” David Wall says. “Given the traditional UK-Australia sporting rivalry, i don’t know if anyone would acknowledge it but Murray is probably the player who has inherited that legacy more than anyone.

That forehand, it would knock us off our feet. He takes a 30-0 lead. But back comes Murray, who’s got such imagination. A subtle backhand slice drops dead after the first bounce, Del Potro nowhere near it, and a smash makes it 30-all. He’s got a break point when Del Potro nets a surprisingly meek forehand. Yet Murray can’t take it. He’s a touch passive during this rally and Del Potro wins it with a fine volley for deuce. Murray has another chance, however, picking Del Potro off with a backhand lob. Del Potro hangs his head as the ball sails over him. Then he saves the break point with a heatseeker of a forehand down the line.He’s going to have to do it again, though. Murray opens Del Potro up with a drop shot, then whacks a backhand volley past him. But Del Potro saves himself with a big serve out wide, Murray only able to block a backhand long.

Given his exertions against Nadal yesterday, the nightmare scenario for him was to lose a long first set tonight, especially after hinting that he was going to snatch it. But that’s what’s happened. A couple of questions come to mind now. One, how much has that taken out of Del Potro? Two, will Murray put his foot on the accelerator now? Let’s see. At 30-all, Murray lazily swipes a forehand down the line wide to give up a break point. He saves it with a piercing forehand for deuce. But Del Potro earns another chance, carving out a second break point by forcing the error from Murray with a big forehand. Yet Murray shows amazing chutzpah by constantly going to the Del Potro forehand throughout the next rally, before winning the point with a drop shot. Del Potro applauds. Then he sets about earning a third break point, challenging correctly when a Murray backhand slice drifts long. Third time lucky? You bet! Murray targets the Del Potro backhand and races to the net, not counting on the big Argentinian walloping a stonking pass down the line!

So Juan Martin del Potro is serving to stay in the first set again. He’ll fancy his chances in the tie-break if he can hold here. But Murray looks determined to make life difficult for him, pumping his fist when Del Potro nets a forehand at 15-0. Soon it’s 15-30, Del Potro failing to do enough with a volley, leaving it in the air long enough for Murray to whip a forehand pass beyond him. Suddenly the mood’s changed. Murray returns expertly and he’s got two set points when Del Potro totally mishits his forehand riposte. This is gutsy stuff from Del Potro, though, a heavy second serve that is too much for Murray, who nets a forehand. That’s one set point gone. Can Murray take the second? They trade boulders from the back of the court. Del Potro looks flustered, as though he’s running out of ideas. Murray’s defending superbly. Del Potro changes his approach and decides to come forward. Mistake. The ball’s on Murray’s backhand and he doesn’t miss these, sending a searing pass down the line to claim an epic first set! Murray roars! He’s two sets away from retaining his Olympic title. “Andy keeping his emotions in check here, in a Masters event at this stage Andy would be in the middle of what I call the MMMM(Murray’sMidMatchMeltdown) when he starts screaming like a demented highland banshee after losing a few games on the trot,” says John McEnerney.

A slider of an ace out wide makes it 30-15 and it’s 40-15 when Del Potro misses a forehand by a whisker. But Murray’s work isn’t done yet. He nets a backhand to make it 40-30 and Del Potro senses an opportunity, romping forward to put a volley away for deuce. The Argentinian is looking dejected after missing a backhand slice, though. He can hardly believe he’s sent that one long. He’s let Murray off the hook there and the Scot holds when Del Potro balloons a forehand.

The next point is a minor classic, both men giving it everything ... but it ends with a stunning winner from Del Potro, a crashing forehand down the line for 0-30. Murray’s in big trouble. His first serve has disappeared. He’s slightly lucky to win the next point. Del Potro challenges a Murray forehand, thinking it’s wide, but the umpire fails to spot the raised arm from the Argentinian. I’m not sure how that’s possible, he’s only 6ft 6in. Told that he didn’t challenge quickly enough, Del Potro has to suck it up and 15-30 becomes 30-all when Murray puts a smash away. That non-challenge had the feel of a Big Moment.

Murray’s level has dipped a little here and his first double fault hands Del Potro a break point. Can he take it? He can! Murray nets a backhand to concede a sloppy game and Del Potro is back in this! “Shhh, don’t tell anyone, but I am 100% with McMahon,” says Matt Dony. “Murray doesn’t really have much to prove, but back-to-back Olympic titles really would be something special. It’s hard to believe that, outside people who follow tennis, he still appears to be underrated. My mum, for one, is still convinced he’s just another plucky loser who gets lucky from time to time. He’ll no doubt go down in history as a great player. And another gold for britain’s ever-increasing tally would be welcome. And yet, Del Potro has quietly become one of the most popular athletes at the games, and for good reason. This is just about as much of a ‘win/win’ situation as I can imagine. At the end of the match, whichever way it goes, I’m going to be happy.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1 of 2 Newest Newer Older Oldest Topics Rio 2016 Olympic Games Tennis Andy Murray Juan Martín del Potro Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports selected soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports selected soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Sports › Rio 2016 Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

BiersdorferThe New York Times Q: How does the Google Maps app know there is a car stopped by the side of the highway or a jam up ahead? A: Google pulls in traffic data from multiple sources for its Maps app, including information from police and local transportation departments. Many reports concerning real-time events — like cars stopped on the highway shoulder, debris on the road, construction, congestion and accidents — come from the users of its Waze service. Waze, a company Google acquired in 2013, has mobile apps for Android and iOS devices. Waze members can use the app for navigation to a destination and to report traffic observations and incidents along the route. One screen within the Waze app provides a set of icons for users — typically passengers in the car — to update the app’s maps with new information, including stopped vehicles. These Waze reports are then incorporated into the Google Maps navigation, too. Google has been collecting traffic and map data for more than a decade and gathering crowdsourced congestion reports since at least 2009, and the collection has given the company a long history of patterns and trends for its software to analyze. Google Maps users contribute to the traffic database, too, as speed and location information from devices using the app (inside the moving cars) is shared with the company. The app uses a color code on routes to indicate current traffic conditions, including green for no delays, orange for a moderate amount of traffic and deepening shades of red as road congestion becomes worse and progress slows to a crawl. Last year, Google Maps added new traffic alerts that preview the conditions between you and your destination — and suggest alternate roads to get you there faster if an accident or other incident has occurred on your original route.

Photo: AP Born in Google’s shadow, Niantic strode into the spotlight with a mobile Internet spin on hunting Pokemon, but can the obsession with the game lead to long-term financial success? Niantic founder and chief executive John Hanke has told a story of naming the company after a whaling ship abandoned in San Francisco Harbor by crew members who rushed off to seek fortunes during the famed Gold Rush. The ship was run aground and converted into a store. The notion of such long-forgotten wrecks prompted Hanke six years ago to use the name Niantic to christen a quest to combine gaming, mobile mapping and augmented reality to playfully reveal virtual things hidden in the real world. Niantic was a side-project for Hanke at Google, which had bought the entrepreneur’s start-up Keyhole in 2004 and turned it into the free mapping service Google Earth. Hanke spent years as a top executive in a Google “geo” division producing widely used services such as Maps and Street View. The gamer wanted to go beyond helping people navigate and have fun with the ability for mobile devices to detect people’s locations. The entrepreneur toyed with the idea of launching a new start-up, but instead kept Niantic anchored in the Silicon Valley technology powerhouse. “Staying at Google gave us the advantage of being able to tap into the data we have at [mapping division] Geo and the infrastructure of Google,” Hanke was quoted as saying in a 2012 Inc magazine article. The Niantic project fielded its first offering in 2011 in the form of a mobile application called Fieldtrip that served up information about where smartphone users were or nearby places of interest. The following year, Niantic launched a game called Ingress, seen as a predecessor to Pokemon Go. Ingress, which has been downloaded more than 15 million times, also uses real world surroundings as the game board. Instead of trying to catch cartoon monsters, such as iconic Pikachu, by targeting them with Pokeballs, Ingress players battle for control of virtual portals. Early Ingress fans submitted pictures of places as possible portals complete with satellite position metadata, essentially crowdsourcing a rich geo-location database that was put to use in Pokemon Go. When Google underwent a corporate restructuring last year to divvy its endeavors into arms of a freshly created parent company called Alphabet, Niantic went independent. Google did invest in Niantic, as did Nintendo and The Pokemon Co. Niantic claims from 50 to 100 employees. The private company does not make its financial information public, but some analysts value it at more that US$3 billion. To justify such a valuation, Niantic will have to prove that Pokemon Go is a lasting and profitable, not just another passing fling for notoriously fickle mobile game players. Pokemon Go has shown it can make money. Industry tracker Sensor Tower estimated that the game generated more than US$200 million in revenue during the month after its release early last month. The game is free, but players can buy virtual supplies such as PokeBalls and lures to attract Pokemon. Cafes, pubs, restaurants and other venues have taken to buying lures that tempt players to linger and hopefully spend money, while waiting to catch Pokemon. During a recent Venture Beat technology conference, Hanke said that the game was designed from the outset for in-app purchases and that revenue could also be made from sponsorships along the lines of what was done in Ingress. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1583 times.

Honestly, not much that we didn’t already know. This is a US team that’s clearly more talented than their opponents, but they’re not invulnerable. If they don’t play better in the upcoming elimination games, it wouldn’t even be a huge upset if they get knocked out at some point. In back to back games, the US have been able to survive partly because time ran out on their opponent’s comeback attempt. It’s probably particularly troubling that France was able to pressure them all game without Tony Parker playing a single second. Maybe this is a tad too gloomy. With the win, the US has secured the top seed in the group and one has to think that they’ll raise their game once the real tournament play begins. We’ll see. That’s it for today’s US basketball coverage, but stick with the Guardian for literal around-the-clock coverage of the Rio Olympics.

But the exact nature of that change will be determined by the social, political, and business choices we make. A digital platform economy is emerging. Companies such as Amazon, Etsy, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, and Uber are creating online structures that enable a wide range of human activities. This opens the way for radical changes in how we work, socialize, create value in the economy, and compete for the resulting profits. Their effects are distinct and identifiable, though certainly not the only part of the rapidly reorganizing global economy. As the work by Michael Cusumano, Annabelle Gawer, and Peter Evans has shown, these digital platforms are multisided digital frameworks that shape the terms on which participants interact with one another. The initial powerful information technology (IT) transformation of services emerged with the Internet and was, in part, a strategy response to intense price-based competition among producers of relatively similar products. IT-enabled services transformation, as our colleagues Stuart Feldman, Kenji Kushida, Jonathan Murray, and Niels Christian Nielsen have argued in other venues, was based on the application of an array of computable algorithms to myriad activities, from consumption and leisure to services and manufacturing. The movement of these algorithms to the cloud, where they can be easily accessed, created the infrastructure on which, and out of which, entire platform-based markets and ecosystems operate. Platforms and the cloud, an essential part of what has been called the “third globalization,” reconfigure globalization itself. These digital platforms are diverse in function and structure. Google and Facebook are digital platforms that offer search and social media, but they also provide an infrastructure on which other platforms are built. Amazon is a marketplace, as are Etsy and eBay. Amazon Web Services provides infrastructure and tools with which others can build yet more platforms. Airbnb and Uber use these newly available cloud tools to force deep changes in a variety of incumbent businesses. Together they are provoking reorganization of a wide variety of markets, work arrangements, and ultimately value creation and capture. This digitally based new economy has been given a variety of names derived from some of its perceived attributes. How we label this transformation matters because the labels influence how we study, use, and regulate these digital platforms. Its boosters have called it the Creative Economy or the Sharing Economy, whereas those less convinced of its beneficence have dubbed it the Gig Economy, the Precariat, or the 1099 Economy, focusing on its impact on workers and how they are compensated. And there are wide variations within these labels. Consider the Shared Economy. Examples include Uber and Airbnb, which are very distant from the visions of Wikipedia, with its communal construction of knowledge; from Napster, which shared music regardless of whether it was legal; or from open source software creations such as Linux and Apache. Despite the attractive label and the entrepreneurial successes, Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook are not based on “sharing”; rather, they monetize human effort and consumer assets. Indeed, the advantage of platform-based companies often rests on an arbitrage between the practices adopted by platform firms and the rules by which established companies operate, which are intended to protect customers, communities, workers, and markets. Lyft and Airbnb are entrepreneurial initiatives that facilitate the conversion of consumption goods such as automobiles and apartments into goods that are monetized. This “sharing” has a more than passing resemblance to the putting-out economy that existed before factories, when companies would ship materials to people to assemble items such as shoes, clothing, or firearms in their homes. In the current manifestation of putting out, the platform operator has unprecedented control over the compensation for and organization of work, while still claiming to be only an intermediary. On the other hand, the rapidly growing mobile phone app stores and user-generated content platforms such as YouTube and Instagram are structured as digital consignment industries, borrowing from the way artists sell their work through galleries. We are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. We prefer the term “platform economy,” or “digital platform economy,” a more neutral term that encompasses a growing number of digitally enabled activities in business, politics, and social interaction. If the industrial revolution was organized around the factory, today’s changes are organized around these digital platforms, loosely defined. Indeed, we are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. The proliferation of labels is simply a reflection of the recognition that platforms are already having powerful consequences for society, markets, and firms, and that we are unclear about their dynamics and directions. Whatever we call the transformation, the consequences are dramatic. Utopia or dystopia The debate about the impact of the platform economy is an extension of a discussion that began in the early days of the IT revolution, when figures such as Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs claimed that they were creating a future that would open the world to new possibilities and prospects. Optimists still abound, and San Francisco is now experiencing what may be its biggest gold rush yet, with investors, entrepreneurs, and data scientists working furiously to create “disruptive” new businesses. For investors, inherently optimists, the question is how to build platforms, attract users, and then capture the value that is generated from the emerging ecosystem. Regardless of the platform, all of them are based on mobilizing human beings to contribute. Whether it is Google monetizing our searches, Facebook monetizing our social networks, LinkedIn monetizing our professional networks, or Uber monetizing our cars, they all depend on the digitization of value-creating human activities. The optimistic version of the emerging techno-economic system suggests that society can be reconstituted with producers becoming proto-entrepreneurs able to work on flexible schedules and benefit from these platforms. And this certainly will be the case for many. Similarly, the utopians argue that platforms, such as the car-sharing services Uber and Lyft, can unlock the commercial value in underused personal assets; other platforms, such as Airbnb, promote the notion that vacant rooms in one’s house or apartment can become sources of income whether technically hotel rooms or not. Advocates believe that all of this can occur for the greater social good without negative consequences. But can we really foresee all the repercussions of these new economic arrangements? For example, platform businesses matching workers and tasks may make labor markets more efficient, but if they become pervasive and organize a significant portion of the work, they are at the same time likely to generate fragmented work schedules and increasing levels of part-time work without the employment-related benefits that previously characterized much employer-based full-time work. For now, it is not clear whether these digital platforms are simply introducing digital intermediaries or actually increasing the extent of gig or contract work. Even as the digital era unfolded in its utopian phase in the 1970s, there were skeptics who feared that the new technologies would result in unanticipated and undesirable consequences. Perhaps most prescient was Kurt Vonnegut’s 1952 novel Player Piano, which even gave a bit part to the great mathematician Norbert Weiner. Vonnegut envisioned a digital future of material abundance—albeit a digital future of machines built with tubes, not semiconductors—with a radical social division between a highly credentialed and creatively employed elite and an underclass. His dystopian vision is now finding full expression in the fear that digital machines, artificial intelligence, robots, and the like will displace work for a vast swath of the population. Bill Davidow, once at Intel and then at his own Silicon Valley venture capital firm, expressed this in his Harvard Business Review article “What Happens to Society When Robots Replace Workers?” The MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explore this trend in more detail in their book The Second Machine Age. The impact on employment and the character of work is certainly one element in assessing whether we will have a utopia or dystopia. In our view, that outcome is yet to be determined. As a society we will have to make choices about how to deploy new technologies, choices that will be critical in shaping the ultimate impact. The questions are really: what balance will there be among jobs created as the digital wave flows through our economy and society, and which workers will be displaced? Certainly it is feasible to catalogue existing work, particularly work that is routine, as likely to be replaced or reconfigured by digital tools, and perhaps, as some have tried, to estimate the numbers of such existing jobs that will be digitized away. By contrast, the new kinds of work that are now being created and the existing jobs that will be redefined and reorganized in the future are more difficult to forecast, so we can only speculate. Algorithms and databases are automating some kinds of work, but even as this occurs other value-creating opportunities are appearing. There will be new products and services as well as new production and service processes, which are likely to be design and creativity intensive, as well as algorithm-enabled. Some of the early indicators of the new or transformed work can be enumerated, but certainly not exhaustively counted. Moreover, existing jobs will be redefined and reorganized in the future. The character of some existing work—how much or how little, we cannot know—will be reframed but not eliminated by digital technology. Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Handy, and other platform firms are transforming industries by connecting “producers” with customers in new ways. In some cases, this is displacing or threatening existing, often regulated, service providers, such as taxis and hotels. In other cases, it is formalizing previously less organized or locally organized work. Still other platforms, such as app stores and YouTube, are creating entirely new value-creating activities that are formalizing into what can be seen as precarious careers, such as a YouTube producer or smartphone app developer. Finally, existing organizations are creating new digital and social media marketing departments and jobs. The question in these cases is what system of control and value capture will be in place. Our sense is not necessarily that there will be less work, but that for a growing number of jobs, the relationship with an employer will be more tenuous than ever. These changes are not likely to result in the workerless society. One possibility is a society in which the preponderance of the work and value creation is more dispersed than ever before, even as the platform owners centralize the transactions and capture their value. Indeed, we may, unless policy rules lock in the position of the emerging incumbent, see another round of innovation and job creation. The use of digital automation presents a classic dilemma: anything that can be characterized sufficiently to become computable can be copied, as our colleague Niels Christian Nielsen has argued elsewhere. At that point, another round of innovation and imagination will be required. Can automation innovate itself? More likely, teams of people and digital tools working together will be required to be competitive. The Turing test might be able to establish that a digital machine can imitate intelligence, but the test does not establish consciousness or consider whether human consciousness in all its diversity differs in fundamental ways from current algorithmic tools. The debate over jobs created or destroyed is useful and worth continuing, but we should be clear that it has no end, and there will be no definitive answer. For now, there are only indicators and traces to suggest an outcome. And that outcome, we emphasize and repeat, will be shaped by choices about technology deployment that turn on entrepreneurial initiative, corporate strategies, and public policies. As in the discussion of what is being called the Internet of Things or the digitally based reorganization of manufacturing, in our research with colleagues at the Research Institute for the Finnish Economy, we find significant differences among national emphasis and investments. German policy is directed toward maintaining its competitive position in manufacturing built on a base of skills and with a fabric of small and mid-sized companies even as the foundations of production evolve. The U.S. emphasis seems to be on developing and applying high-end sophisticated tooling for aerospace and military applications. On the consumer side, some communities have simply banned Uber and Lyft, whereas others welcomed it. Which communities, this leads us to ask, are most likely to be the sources and beneficiaries of the emerging platform economy? Which are most likely to be discomfited? Although technologies may not dictate our future, they frame the choices to be made and the questions to be answered. Will the platform economy, and the reorganization it portends, catalyze economic growth and a surge in productivity driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs? Or will the algorithmically driven reorganization concentrate substantially all of the gains in the hands of those who build the platforms? Will it spark a wave of entrepreneurial possibilities, unleash unimagined creativity, free workers from oppressive work schedules, or unleash an avalanche of dispossessed workers who are trying to make a living with gigs and temporary contracts? If we do not interrogate these technological trajectories, we risk becoming unwitting victims of their outcomes. What questions should we be asking? The key technologies The algorithmic revolution and cloud computing are the foundations of the platform economy. But computing power is only the beginning of the story. That computing power is converted into economic tools using algorithms operating on the raw material of data. The software layer that stretches across and is interwoven with the economy is a fabric of algorithms. That software layer, that algorithmic fabric, is being extended to cover manufacturing, giving birth to the Internet of Things, the Internet of Everything, or the Industrial Internet, with its implied webs of sensor networks. It is no exaggeration to say that software was formerly embedded in things, but now things—services as well as physical objects—are woven into software-based network fabrics. This software layer extends the availability and lowers the cost of access to digital tools and traditional tools accessed by and controlled by digital processes. Moreover, costs drop through the use of open-source software, cloud storage and computing, and physical spaces such as those provided by TechShops that enable individuals to work with advanced industrial-scale equipment. Among other consequences, this certainly lowers the cost of entry for newcomers. Cloud computing rests on the virtualization and abstraction of computing processes. One of us (Zysman) has examined the character, emergence, and deployment of cloud computing in work with Jonathan Murray, Kenji Kushida, Patrick Scaglia, and Rick McGeer. Although the details of how it works do not matter for this essay, the consequences do. For the providers of cloud services, scale matters enormously. For users—individuals, small- and mid-size enterprises, startups, and corporations—the consequence is a radical reduction in the cost of computing resources and information and communication technology tools, a radical reduction in barriers to usage. Users can rent resources as they require them rather than having to own or build entire computing systems. Computing and the applications and platforms it facilitates are now available as an operating expense rather than a capital expense. Digital platforms are complicated mixtures of software, hardware, operations, and networks. The key aspect is that they provide a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. Android and IOS are platforms. Although they somewhat restrict the applications that one can build or sell, they are, in general, open to app builders. Android is also a platform for hardware (handset and other device makers) because the code is open, not just the interfaces. Indeed, platforms can grow on platforms. Many of the current Internet platform firms use Amazon Web Services. Many of these platforms attract a myriad of other contributors that, when sufficiently rich, can result in the formation of an ecosystem. For example, in the case of the apps stores, complementary businesses are emerging. AppAnnie is a firm that ranks the revenue generated by apps; there are advertising agencies that analyze YouTube ad buying; TubeMogul classifies YouTube “stars” and measures their reach; and there has been a proliferation of agencies that cultivate new YouTubers. These “complementors” are powerful allies in building and maintaining the lock-in for the master platform. Of course, building a platform is work, but platforms themselves then generate or organize the work of others by providing the digital locations for the connections that organize work and other activities. A looser definition of a platform, as noted previously, is one in which social and economic interactions are mediated online, often by apps. For example, Uber, so far as we know, does not yet provide a platform upon which others can establish businesses, such as organizing a pizza delivery fleet. Nevertheless, as an algorithmic structure providing a digital market and potentially an ecosystem, albeit one it controls, Uber should be considered as a firm operating a platform. Digital platforms facilitated by key technologies such as the cloud, including digital marketplaces such as Amazon and Internet firms such as Google and Facebook, are restructuring ever more parts of the economy. The discussion is complicated because, as noted, there is not yet a clear definition of digital platforms that allows us to specify precisely what is in and out of the category. The term “platform” simply points to a set of online digital arrangements whose algorithms serve to organize and structure economic and social activity. In the IT world, the term means a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces that are open to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. As used more widely, and by us in this essay, the term also points to a set of digital frameworks for social and marketplace interactions. Speculations aside, while there is a rich and emerging literature, at the moment there is no real theory of the effect of these diverse platforms on the overall economy. To sense the scope of the market and regulatory impact of the loosely labeled platform economy, let us consider some of the most salient types of digital platforms. In all these examples, across all the categories, the algorithmic underpinnings of the online activity are most evident. For example, Lyft connects drivers with customers algorithmically. The algorithms integrate mapping software, real-time road conditions, and the availability of drivers to provide a price estimate. Drivers are vetted through online checks, which, of course, work only as well as the data they have. Payment is made by credit card information that is on file. Economic consequences What we do know is that these platforms are in many cases disrupting the existing organization of economic activity by resetting entry barriers, changing the logic of value creation and value capture, playing regulatory arbitrage, repackaging work, or repositioning power in the economic system. As a starting place for discussion, we might ask the following questions about each platform or type of platform. How is value created? The platform economy comprises a distinctly new set of economic relations that depend on the Internet, computation, and data. The ecosystem created by each platform is a source of value and sets the terms by which users can participate. Who captures the value? Indeed, what is the distribution of risks and rewards for the platform users? There are a variety of mechanisms with various implications for gains distribution. Some platforms allow the owner to “tax” all transactions, whereas others monetize their services through advertising. Platforms can transform work previously done by traditional employees into tasks performed by contractors, consigners, or quid pro quo workers—or create entirely new categories of work. There are also what Gina Neff calls “venture laborers,” that is, the people who work at the platform firms. They receive high wages, and if the firm is successful, the value of the platform is capitalized in the stock market, resulting in remarkable amounts of wealth for the firm’s direct employees and entrepreneurs. If the firm falters or fails, these individuals must find new employment. There is also a growing cohort of what some call “mini-entrepreneurs” and others call “consignment workers,” who provide goods—usually but not necessarily “virtually”—for platforms such as app stores, YouTube, or Amazon Self-Publishing. Although the vast majority of them are unsuccessful or marginally profitable, some can be enormously successful, and despite the fact that this phenomenon is as yet unmeasured, it is clearly creating many new opportunities for entrepreneurship. In certain cases, particularly in apps, those in the consignment economy sometimes grow so large that venture capitalists will invest in the entrepreneur/firm, and the employees become venture labor. Some of these apps can become platforms themselves. Put differently, the consignment model has significant upside for participants, but it is accompanied by high risk. Who owns or controls the platform? The answer varies by platform, and the differences are important. The distribution of benefits differs considerably, for example, at these platforms: Wikipedia, where the network is managed by a consensus set of rules; the Danish Agricultural Cooperative platform, in which participant owners know one another and there are clear boundaries between inside owners and others; and Uber, in which the platform is owned by a small group of entrepreneurs and their venture capitalists and where the value will eventually be capitalized by the sale of a controlling interest through either acquisition or a stock offering. How is work packaged and value created, and what percentage of work is now organized in these radically new ways? What happens to the organizational forms of work? Certainly, some workers, such as those employed by Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook, retain traditional employment relationships. Although these firms expect long working hours, they also provide considerable scheduling flexibility as well as a variety of free food, drinks, transportation, and other benefits that can make them appear to be corporate paradises. By comparison, those who obtain work as gigs, consignments, or contracts through digital platforms have radically different experiences. Although they have control of their work hours, they rarely receive any other employee benefits. Conceptually, if not literally, Uber converts taxi company employees or former medallion owners into contractors, whose access to income is through the Uber platform, while removing government from the rate-setting equation. Are these contractors mini-entrepreneurs, employees in all but name, or yet something else? Further, what is the proper employment category for individuals who hope to be one of the winners by producing apps, YouTube videos, or self-published books on Amazon? In these activities, there is a power law of returns by which a few big winners are remunerated by advertising, product placement payments, personal appearance fees, and even crowd-funding campaigns, while a very long tail of producers are creating the vast bulk of consigned content without monetary return. Many are now concerned that rather than creating a new source of productivity we are legitimating a new form of putting out. Can Uber drivers be self-supporting contractors in a 1099 economy rather than stable workers in an employment economy, or are they just extremely vulnerable gig workers? And, more broadly, as Ruth Collier asks, what will be the consequences for mass politics and political structures? Are we generating labor market flexibility, or a precariat that resembles a cyberized Downton Abbey replete with a small elite composed of the platform owners and a new and sizable underclass? Making choices What sort of an economy and society will we create in the transition to digital platforms and the accompanying reorganization of significant portions of the global economy? And importantly, what choices will we have? Before we turn to the long list of issues, with each issue opening an array of questions and debates, two points need to be made. First, Larry Lessig famously claimed that code is law; that is, code represents binding restrictions on behavior. Algorithms and platforms structure and constrain behavior; the law in the books is often difficult to apply or enforce in the digital world where action is possible only if it conforms to frameworks expressed in the code that shapes and directs behavior. Consider the fight between the Justice Department and Apple; the warrant has no meaning if it cannot be executed in code; for the warrant to be implemented, the code would have to be modified. Platform entrepreneurs increasingly believe that if they possess a first-mover advantage, they can, in fact, remake existing law by creating new practices on their platforms that essentially establish new norms of behavior. It is often said in Silicon Valley, “Don’t ask permission; ask forgiveness,” as, perhaps, was the case with Volkswagen’s “fix” for “clean” diesel engines. Of course, this forces two sets of questions. First, who writes the code, and whose values are expressed in code? The code writers, taking Uber as an example, have already reshaped social behavior. Government rules will influence how the new technologies are deployed and their consequences, but in a platform economy, government decisions may be constrained by the “facts” in the software. Second, although public policies are obviously important, corporate strategies also have far-reaching effects. Do companies view workers only as costs to be contained or as assets—even in an era of algorithms, data, and robots—to be developed and promoted? And equally important, are those assets directly tied to the firm? Who should bear the costs of their retention and upgrading? Acknowledging the constraints of code and the centrality of company choice in shaping outcomes, our platform future, the character of market, and the social logic established will depend on an array of policy choices. What market and social rules are appropriate for a platform economy and society? Our old labels and categories, not just old rules, are being thrown into disarray. To begin sorting this out, let us start with the firm. In the late nineteenth century, the corporation emerged as a means of orchestrating economic activity and organizing markets. In the twenty-first century, we speculate that these functions will be taken on by the platform in the cloud. Take Google, the platform economy giant, which, despite its 2014 revenues of $66 billion, has only 50,000 employees. Uber has only about 1,500 employees and is already a global business. What policy and political issues arise when the orchestrators of economic activity are relatively small firms, rather than organizations as large as Ford Motor Company, General Electric, or General Motors—all of whom also require sophisticated supplier and distribution networks? It is evident that platforms open up many entrepreneurial opportunities. Some entrepreneurs, such as Robin Chase at Zipcar, envisioned an alternative social, not just economic, model because digitally enabled car sharing could dramatically reduce the incentive to own a car. If that model spread widely, it might result in a drop in overall demand for auto production. This may or may not disrupt Hertz (Zipcar was sold to Avis), but it might dramatically affect automakers. Indeed, automakers responded by developing partnerships with Uber and Lyft. In other words, such “sharing” solutions could have unforeseen ripple effects on entire market ecosystems, as encyclopedia and book publishers are discovering to their dismay. But many platforms by their very nature prove to be winner-take-all markets, in which only one or two companies survive, and the platform owner is able to appropriate a generous portion of the entire value created by all the users on the platform. More important, however, is that as the power is centralized, the platform owner can become a virtual monopolist. In that case, the platform owner can squeeze the platform community—the drivers or customers on Lyft or Uber, the content providers, the consigners, the customers, essentially any of the participants in the ecosystem who are instrumental in creating the value in the first place. Perhaps competition among platforms in a similar domain, Uber and Lyft for example, might mute the consequences of the power inside the platform. In any case, a monopoly position or even a strong oligopoly might inhibit, or sharply constrain, further entrepreneurial efforts. Indeed, the appropriate market rules for competition/antitrust, labor market, and intellectual property among many others are becoming increasingly difficult to specify and legislate. Policy and political interests among the players, even among the winners, are far from uniform. Consider such domains as antitrust policy, where the European Commission has done battle with U.S. tech companies; intellectual property, where the interests among information and communications technology firms and platform firms are less consistent than it might seem at first glance; network policy, where carriers such as AT&T have radically different interests from Netflix or Google; and labor market policies. Indeed, the wireless carriers have announced they will start blocking advertisements on smartphones, thereby directly attacking the Google and Facebook business models. As we have shown with Bryan Pon, the turbulent environment in the smartphone ecosystem is leading to complex competitive strategies that have technical, social, and political ramifications. The question of outcomes goes beyond the question of whether digital platforms spawn entrepreneurs or monopolists. We need to ask whether a society organized around platform owners servicing mini-entrepreneurs, contractors, and gig workers portends an even more unequal society. Does the answer depend on the character of platforms or on the policies and politics of the platform economy? The issues of entrepreneurship and those of work organization that we discussed earlier are tightly interwoven. The policies that we adopt now might determine the balances achieved later. If we want an entrepreneurial spirit to infuse the platform world, then we want risk-taking entrepreneurs, whether they are forming the platforms or seeking advantage as contractors or consigners within it. But what encourages risk? Fear, or a safety-net certainty that if a gamble fails, one can always play again? Similarly, if we want workers to accept the new arrangements, how do we assure them that if they accept the flexibility, they will not be the victims but rather the beneficiaries of the ever-greater social value and wealth that is being created? All studies of technology adoption have shown that those who believe they will be victims will resist; if they believe they will be beneficiaries, they may help facilitate the shift. Of course, the largest group consists of those in the middle who are joining the platform economy because they have no choice and do not feel empowered to resist. Balancing the need to sustain initiative while cushioning the consequences of significant socioeconomic transformation leads us to a focus on social policy, not just market policy. Social policy, sometimes called welfare, shapes the risks that workers and entrepreneurs take and their evaluation of whether to support or resist change. In the United States, benefits such as pensions and health-care coverage (the latter, until the passage of the Affordable Care Act) have been tightly tied to employment. Lose your employment, lose the protections. The U.S. debate often assumes that expanded welfare protections dampen initiative, pointing to Europe as an example of how investing in social protections limits economic dynamism. Aside from whether this was, in fact, ever the case in Europe, the question is whether social protection will inherently discourage initiative now. In our view, the real issue is never the fact of protections themselves—and indeed we believe that facilitating social and economic adjustment by easing the burdens of those dislocated is both a social obligation and an economic necessity—but how social policy is paid for and organized. The emerging platform economy, with expanding contract work and gig employment, has encouraged many to look at the Nordic social policy model. The Danish flexible security model suggests that social protections can lubricate the engines of change. Simply put, many social benefits in that model are associated with citizenship, and the notion of flexible security gives employers extensive rights to adjust their workforce as needed while still providing workers with social protections in the form of training, job placement, and basic income. Certainly, this is no panacea, and indeed the Nordics are themselves reopening and intensely debating the character of their social policies. But we must consider whether addressing the downside risks of entrepreneurial efforts while providing worker flexibility with broader social safety nets as social rights can make the platform economy a source of sustainable growth. What assurances of social safety do we want to give to risk takers? The debate over policy will not be straightforward or simple. As with all economic transformations, the disruptions will create winners and losers. Who will decide how the results of increased productivity are distributed? The reality is that the winners and losers in markets depend on who can participate and on what terms. There are no markets, and no market platforms, without rules, but what happens to the politics if important market rules are made unchallenged by the platform owners? Many political struggles will be waged over these rules, and those fights will be part of defining the market and society in a platform era. Political fights will break out over protections for communities, clients, and workers as markets are disrupted. Some of those fights will be about business models that are playing a game of policy arbitrage, whereas others may be about rules for the consignment platforms. In any case, how many instances of disruption will there be? Should we view these disruptions as creating a flood of viable entrepreneurial possibilities or as destroying the security of employment relations for many? Can they create new sources of income and reasonably compensated work? Can policy encourage labor market arrangements that facilitate innovation, provide protection for workers, are efficient, and promote decent, sustainable lives for citizens? In the platform world, is there a Henry Ford who recognizes that everyone in the ecosystem requires a reasonable income in order to buy his products? This will not be a straightforward process. The reorganization of the economy around platforms will inevitably change the very configuration of the interest groups that influence how the law tries to shape the code. In sum, these battles, often engaged in isolation from each other, will interweave to reshape our communities and social life, as José van Djick has shown, as well as the character of markets and market competition. In the era of the platform, the future remains open. Answers to crucial questions are for the moment unknowable. The answers depend on our choices, not just on the technology. For example, will cloud technologies and the platform-driven economic reorganization they cause drive the productivity growth on which sustained real income improvement occurs? Will these reorganizations destroy jobs or reduce the required skill levels? The technologies—the cloud, big data, algorithms, and platforms—will not dictate our future. How we deploy and use these technologies will. When we look at the history of innovations such as electric utility grids, call centers, and the adoption of technology standards, we find that the market and social outcomes of using new technologies vary across countries. Once we start on a technology path, it frames our choices, but the technology does not determine in the first place exactly which trajectory we will follow. We will be making choices in an inherently fluid and ever-changing environment shaped to some degree by unpredictable technical change and social reactions to these changes. Ultimately, the results will depend on how we believe markets should be structured—who gains and who can compete; how we innovate; what we value in society; how we protect our communities, our workers, and the clients and users of these technologies; and how we channel the enormous opportunities created by these sociotechnical changes. It is up to us to sidestep a dystopia and to create, if not a utopia, at least a world of ever greater benefit for communities and citizens.

More recently its Douglas Rushkoff chiming in here with a critical view of digital platforms. From his blog and his book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, he warns that the promise of the digital age is being hijacked by a rampant form of old-style capitalism, a modus operandi akin to that of the robber-barons of the 19th century. ‘These platforms don’t exist to help people exchange with one another,’ he says. ‘They really are scorched-earth efforts at achieving monopolies in particular industries, not in order to serve those industries or even sustain them or grow them, but in order to hop over into another industry altogether. Has rampant capitalism hijacked the promise of the digital age? University of Maryland legal academic Frank Pasquale, who focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of information technology, calls them the ‘Silicon Valley oligarchs’. ‘I think the fundamental problem is that people don’t like to face up to the reality of monopolisation,’ says Pasquale, speaking about the global rise of Uber, Airbnb and other so-called sharing economy companies. ‘It’s much more convenient to believe the comforting myth that these markets are always contestable. ‘A firm like Uber is an appeal to venture capitalists—speculative capital—that wants to see massive returns via monopolisation. Let’s not mistake the business model here. The model here is for one of these firms to come in and to take over various aspects of commerce, to take over the rides that are in an area, to take over availability of non-hotel rooms to sleep in, et cetera. I think that this is really a perversion of the original aspirations of the sharing economy.’ http://www.rushkoff.com/rampant-capitalism-hijacked-promise-digital-age/ Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:24 am An excellent multi-faceted article. The rise of global (and more localised) platforms has far reaching implications for current socioeconomic and governance infrastructures. Transitions that might historically have taken decades might now occur in years (and without the same degree of localised investment). These will no doubt be accompanied by complementary developments in property rights and governance frameworks, to better suit the emergence of these new constructs and technologies. We can expect to see further innovations in alternative forms of societal / common rights, alongside the development of automated governance / self-regulated platforms, to better suit the increasing instancy and interdependence of the networked world. Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:54 am How the socioeconomic evolution might occur is to be explored further. Probably more a systems evolution issue than one of choice / policy e.g. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245024299_Evolutionary_drive_New_understanding_of_change_in_socio-economic_systems Reply ↓ Rudolf Olah August 14, 2016 at 4:09 pm Very surprised that there is no mention of rent-seeking especially when Uber is mentioned. Many of these platforms are based on lock-in and rent-seeking. I will always remember how Twitter and Facebook cracked down on 3rd party applications using their API and especially how Twitter has bought out or shut down 3rd party apps. Uber is notorious for burning through venture capital and artificially lowering taxi rates. Taxi drivers and UberX drivers are already making less and less thanks to Uber’s profit increases.

This has been seen as an ambitious move by the company as it looks to take on the likes of Microsoft and Apple, all of which have a mobile and PC OS. As for the former, things took a different turn with the release of Windows 10, where the company was determined to end any differences between its PC and mobile OS. In essence, Microsoft has managed to bring a uniform experience between Windows 10 PCs and mobile phones, something that Google is reportedly looking to borrow a leaf from with the introduction of a new OS dubbed Fuchsia. According to the incoming reports, the new Fuchsia OS has a kernel known as Magenta that has been designed to work on practically all devices that are compatible – be it a small embedded device or a desktop. Furthermore, you will come across the Flutter UI framework, which is very friendly when it comes to the Material Design concept, as well as the company’s Dart programming language. Whether this Fuchsia OS will finally come to materialize is still unknown. It is possible that the OS, which can work on a variety of devices, will come in to replace both Android and Chrome OS, but at the same time keeping the special features from both platforms. Still, it is possible that this could just be another Google side project that may never come to materialize, just like many others in the past. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see how Google combines Android and Chrome OS into one unit that can be used to power smartphones, tablets, computers as well as wearables, among other gadgets. Note that this is not official, and like before, Google may come out to deny everything. But as for Fuchsia and its future, it is currently anyone’s guess.

The open-source OS could run on PCs, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Meanwhile, the Google OS features user modes and support for advanced graphics and 64-bit Intel PCs, and uses the Alphabet company's in-house Dart programming language.     Advertisement Like Us on Facebook Google will release Android Nougat in less than one month. However, the new OS spotted at the GitHub hosting service shows that the company is making plans beyond its mobile OS.   The OS at the Git storage space is probably brand new. Its description tells visitors to pick purple, which is not a color that represents Chrome OS or Android. The new OS kernel includes many high-end OS features. They include a capability-based security model and user modes.   Fuchsia can also support ARM architecture, which is a group of computer processor designs introduced in 1985. The new OS is powered by the Magenta and LK kernel. Magenta targets high-tech smartphones and PCs with fast processors, while LK targets small systems.   Google's Fuchsia OS can be tested on a PC or virtual machine. Travis Geiselbrecht is a Google software engineer and has worked on several other OS projects. He explained that Fuchsia will soon run on the mini CPU Raspberry Pi 3, according to Engadget. It is not unequivocal that the new OS will replace Android or Chrome OS, and Google has not made any official statements about the matter. It is now just an experiment that could be part of bigger projects. Google recently unveiled its smart speaker Google Home to challenge Amazon Echo. The new OS could provide more power and flexibility than Brillo for IoT devices, but fewer features than Android. In related news, Russia has fined Google $6.75 million for pre-installing apps on Android mobile devices, according to The Verge. Last year local search engine company Yandex filed a complaint against the United States-based company. Most Russian smartphones and tablets run on Android.       The small fine is the amount of money Google makes in one hour. However, it shows that the tech giant is facing more hatred in Europe.  Here's a Google Nougat preview: Advertisement Tags:google fuchsia google fuchsia operating system new google os Google News google non linux os google OS Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

(Picture: Reuters) Google already is one of the dominating companies in the Operating system market with its Android and Chrome OS, but now according to ‘Android Police’ there is another new operating system being made called ‘Fuchsia.’ Though, Google has not revealed anything yet according to some documentation and codes present in the online project hosting website GitHub. With a plan to make the OS compatible for any or every device, including embedded ones like from car dashboards and thermostats, Google plans to not base it on Linux, unlike Android and Chrome OS. According to the codes present, one can say that apart from different kinds of devices, the OS will still run on smartphones and computers. Reportedly, some advanced security and graphics features is also something in which Google will be working on. Additionally, Fuchsia makes use of Google’s Dart programming language and Material Design-friendly Flutter user interface framework. ‘Fuchsia’ is a kind of flowering plant which covers almost 110 species.

(Rperesentational image) It has been learnt that search giant Google has started working towards developing a standalone operating system which has no links with Android or Chrome OS. The project, dubbed Fuchsia, is the name of a flower and gives the name of a colour. According to reports, the project has been described as: “Pink + Purple = Fuchsia (a new operating system.” The new OS, though, has been speculated to be destined for the IoT market. The proeject uses a custom kernel called Magenta, based on LittleKernel—a project designed for embedded systems, especially IoT devices. The project makes sense as Google has several IoT products in the market including OnHub and Google Home. However, it is not only for IoT platforms and can also run on other types of platforms such as smartphones, tablets, and regular PCs. Also discussions in Fuchsia’s IRC channel indicated that the company will soon add Raspberry Pi3 support as well.

By Corazon Victorino On 08/14/16 AT 9:05 AM Close In a strange turn of events, reports about Google developing a new operating system surfaced this week. The OS that’s causing a huge noise in the online world is an open source, and it is dubbed as Fuchsia. With its existence coming into light, there is now one big question that needs to be answered: Is Google replacing its Chrome OS and Android OS with the new Fuchsia OS?  It may seem too early to tell at this point, but Android Police did not rule out this possibility when it stated that Google could be hoping to replace the Chrome OS and even the hugely popular Android OS with Fuchsia someday. The tech site also indicated that there is also the possibility of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for devices like Google Home and the OnHub router, just like what Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches.  Google’s Fuchsia OS is making headlines because it is not Linux kernel-based unlike the multinational company’s other operating systems, such as the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts, among others. Interestingly, the Fuchsia OS is said to run on almost anything — PCs, Chromebooks, phones and Internet of Things devices.  Related Stories Google Chrome To Block Flash Content Starting Next Month Fuchsia OS originally surfaced from the project’s GitHub page, where it is simply called “a new Operating System.” Part of the operating system’s documentation states that it has support for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. Also, it uses Google’s Dart programming language, according to Engadget.  For now, the Fuchsia OS is just seen as another experiment from Google, and it is far from being officially released anytime soon. Google could be planning on using it for something bigger than what it has now. Nothing’s really been confirmed about Google’s new operating system’s use as of late. The only thing known about what Google has in store for it in the near future is, it could be running the Raspberry Pi 3, Trusted Reviews has learned.  For interested techies, you can check out the project on its official site, but you must know that only limited information about the operating system is found there at present.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google working on Fuchsia OS, that could work on everything Google working on Fuchsia OS, that could work on everything Google is building a completely new operating system, called Fuschia, which will work across devices. By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 16, 2016 9:04 am Google Fuchsia OS could soon replace Android and Chrome OS, claim reports.  As it turns out, Google is building a completely new operating system, which is not just an upgrade to Chrome OS or Android, but is instead a whole new system that isn’t derived from the Linux kernel, claims a report. The interesting bit: This OS will work across everything; from smart home devices to smartphones to the TV, aka, Google’s own OS for the Internet of Things. Given Internet of Things is where the next big technology revolution is headed, it is natural that Google will want to create an OS that will it dominate this space as well. The name of Google’s new OS is given on the project’s GitHub page, which says, “Pink + Purple = = Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” However, Google has not made an official announcement of the project yet. All of Google’s operating systems till date are based on Linux; from ChromeOS to Android. But report hints that Google could be lookingto move on from Linux for an ecosystem of their own. The new OS uses a new Magenta kernel, which will be competing with other commercial embedded operating systems, like ThreadX and FreeRTOS. The Magenta OS will be scaled to work on smartphones, embedded devices and desktop computers, claims the report Android Police. Google is using Dart as the programming code for the OS, and Flutter for the user interface. The OS will support 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs, and also 64-bit PCs. According to an Android Police report, Google hopes to replace Android and Chrome OS with Fuchsia. But the caveat remains this might just be one of Google’s many secretive projects, that never actually makes it to consumers. But Google has hinted in the past it wants to continue innovating on the software front. In June this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said there was more to be done on the software front for Android Nexus smartphones. At the Recode conference, “We will be opinionated where we need to be and where we feel that we need to push the category forward. You’ll see us actually add, more thoughtfully features on top of Android on Nexus phones. There’s a lot of software innovation to be had,” Pichai had said.

For now, Google is expected to release the latest version of its Android OS, v7.0, dubbed Nougat next month. The company started rolling out the Developer Preview 5 of Nougat with final APIs in July, giving a near-final look of the OS. There have also been talks of Google combining Android OS and Chrome OS. In fact, Google plans to bring all Android apps to Chrome OS this year, which will significantly boost the number of apps on the latter. We’ll have to wait and see if rumours about Fuchsia turn out to be true. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

It looks like non-Linux based Fuchsia OS will be the next best thing from the company, powering everything from embedded devices to computers.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Google's operating systems, be it Android, Chromecast or Chrome OS, have always had a common thread in the form of a Linux kernel, but that is about to change. Meet Fuchsia, which Google describes rather cryptically on the GitHub page as "Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)". Despite Linux being the powertrain for Google's hardware for years, there are situations where the kernel behaves sub-optimal. This particularly takes place in the case of embedded devices, such as car dashboards and GPS units. Embedded hardware works much better with one of the alternative ecosystems out there, and Google might be building its very own with Fuchsia. Looking closer at the OS' documentation, things start to fall into place. Fuchsia OS relies on the Magenta kernel, which is crafted as a rival to commercial embedded operating systems, such as ThreadX or FreeRTOS. Magenta, however, has an edge over its aforementioned competitors due to its capability to scale up to desktop computers and smartphones. It does so by sporting first class user-mode support, enabling the creation of user accounts, and a security model which is capability-based, which can allow Android 6.0's permissions to function properly. More details surface when digging into GitHub's files: the primary programming language Google uses in Fuchsia is Dart, while the user interface relies on Flutter. Visuals enthusiasts should know that Escher is being put to work for light diffusion, soft shadows, and other visual effects, including Vulkan and OpenGL. As both subtle color reflections and shadows are one of the staples of Material Design, there is a high chance that Escher and Flutter are crafted with the Material Design UI in mind. The new OS will reportedly play nice with 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs, alongside 64-bit PCs. Google's Travis Geiselbrecht said that the OS will play nice with the Raspberry Pi 3, as well. If you find the concept of Google building an entirely new OS from scratch kind of boggling, read on. Some speculate that Google already envisions a day when Android and Chrome OS will need a replacement, and Fuchsia could evolve to be exactly that. Another possibility is that Google will take a leaf out of Samsung's Tizen OS and choose to run Fuchsia on systems that cannot handle the heftier Android. With Google's increased involvement in embedded hardware such as Google Home and OnHub router, Fuchsia could be a product directly targeted at them. Once we get more details on the development of Fuchsia, we will keep you posted. TAG Fuchsia OS, GitHub, Google, Operating System © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Shares With Android and Chrome OS, Google already has its fair share of operating systems to work on, but there's apparently another coming down the pipe: Android Police spotted a reference to Fuchsia ("a new operating system") in some code left on GitHub. Unlike Chrome OS and Android, Fuchsia won't be based on Linux, and that suggests Google wants it to be able to run on devices of every size, shape and scale - think smart thermostats, car dashboards and wearables, where the Linux kernel can be overkill. It would still be able to run on smartphones and computers, and based on the code that's available it looks like there are some advanced security and graphics features being prepped here. Of course with no official word from Google we're just speculating. Pink and purple are the colours For non-horticulturists, fuchsias are a type of flowering plant covering almost 110 species. We'll leave you to decide whether or not this says anything about Google's plans for the fledgling OS, or hints at what kinds of devices it could potentially run on. Rumours have swirled for years that Mountain View executives would eventually decide to combine Chrome OS and Android, and Chromebooks are now being upgraded to support Android apps. Maybe Fuchsia is an attempt to start again from scratch. Right now we just don't know - it's just a tantalising glimpse into what Google might be planning at the moment. If we hear anything official about the new OS (which apparently blends pink and purple as its key colour), we'll let you know.

There’s Android, Chrome OS, Chromecast, and several more. But yet another open source operating system from the company has been discovered, this one dubbed “Fuchsia.” Now, this is far from a finalized product, mind you, it’s just a new project that’s appeared on GitHub with the description “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” Right from the start, the most obvious difference between Fuchsia and Google’s other OSes is that it’s not based on the Linux kernel. Instead, it uses the new Magenta kernel, which is designed to power Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. As Android Police notes, this makes it a rival to other embedded OSes like FreeRTOS and ThreadX. However, Magenta is also designed to scale up all the way to things like smartphones and even desktop PCs. It includes features like user modes, a capability-based security model, and support for both ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. And because it uses Google’s own Dart programming language along with Flutter, Fuchsia could easily support the Material Design user interface. There’s no guarantee at this point that Google is planning to take Fuchsia beyond anything but IoT devices, but there’s a possibility that down the road it could be used to replace Chrome OS and Android. In the mean time, it’s more likely we’ll see Fuchsia used on future IoT devices like Google Home and OnHub; hardware that doesn’t need to run Android. While we wait to see what Google does with this latest project, you can play around and check out the details on Fuchsia on its GitHub page and on Google Git, and it looks like it will soon support the Raspberry Pi 3.

President Donald Trump: A MENA perspective Home  >  Transportation  >  Who will ride self-driving cars? AMEinfo EXPERTS Talking Tech by Faisal Al Bannai DarkMatter Taking Stock by Hussein Al Sayed FXTM VIEW ALL EXPERTS Who will ride self-driving cars? August 14, 2016 2:28 pm Video captured by a Google self-driving car, inset, is coupled with the same street scene as the data is visualized by the car during a presentation at a media preview of Google's prototype autonomous vehicles in Moutain View, California. (Image: Reuters) Would you trust a self-driving car to ferry you around the city? A surprising number of people said they would. A new study reveals that 70 per cent of consumers in the UAE are open to riding a self-driving car, whereas, globally, 79 per cent said they would ride in a partially self-driving car. The introduction of self-driving cars is in line with the UAE’s long-term vision. Earlier in April, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, announced he wanted 25 per cent of all car trips in Dubai to be driverless by 2030. The study, titled Self-Driving Vehicles, Robo-Taxis and the Urban Mobility Revolution, was published by global management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG), in collaboration with the World Economic Forum. It found that most people around the world are well-aware and knowledgeable about self-driving cars and their benefits. Consumers in the UAE are even willing to pay more for it. A total of 47 per cent of the UAE respondents stated they would pay more for a self-driving car, out of which 72 per cent said they would pay at least $5,000 more for such a vehicle. Consumer willingness to pay extra is driven by an economic logic, which balances the cost against potential savings in other areas, such as lower parking fees and fuel-saving, the report found. Slightly less than half of UAE respondents (44 per cent) find that traditional car manufacturers should be the ones to produce self-driving vehicles (SDVs). Benefits: Global adoption According to an analysis presented by BCG, the adoption of self-driving vehicles, especially shared self-driving taxis, can drop the number of cars on city streets by 60 per cent, reduce tailpipe emissions by at least 80 per cent in and decrease road accidents by 90 per cent. An earlier research conducted by BCG and the World Economic Forum found that, while the broad consumer adoption of SDVs comes with few barriers, the most significant disruption will be seen with widespread adoption of robo-taxis – self-driving cabs. BCG claims this research was the largest global survey on SDVs to date and included more than 5,500 consumers in ten cities around the world. The survey found that 58 per cent of the global consumers are willing to try out SDVs, with the highest willingness levels being among younger consumers. Meanwhile, acceptance of SDVs recorded the highest levels in emerging markets. “Ride-shared, electric robo-taxis can substantially transform and improve urban transportation and, by direct extension, liveability, by providing more people with easier access to mobility, making streets safer, and freeing up space no longer needed for parking. The major players – industry, consumers, and policymakers –are excited and engaged,” Nikolaus Lang, a senior partner at BCG and a co-author of the report, said. Possible outcomes BCG and World Economic Forum developed four possible scenarios for the city of the future, all of which are based on autonomous technology, ride-sharing and electrification, and listed them in order of potential impact.   ‘Premium Car Thrives Itself’ In this likely scenario, self-driving cars would complement existing mobility landscape in high-end offering, resulting in a small reduction of one per cent in the number of vehicles on the streets, through limited sharing of SDVs, and a drop of 20 per cent in the number of accidents on the road, as SDVs eliminate human error and hence are much safer.   ‘SDVs Rule the Streets’ In this scenario SDVs would replace most traditional cars but would continue to primarily be privately owned. Only one in ten SDVs will be shared by a number of individuals; the total number of cars on the street drops by eight per cent. The number of accidents also drops by 55 per cent and there is a five per cent increase in free parking space.   ‘Robo-Taxis Take Over’ These become the primary transportation option in the city. A big change is noticed with 50 per cent decrease in number of cars on the road, as consumers abandon privately owned vehicles and take up robo-taxis. This also results in 90 per cent fewer accidents and nearly 40 per cent of parking space is freed up in a given city.   ‘The Ridesharing Revolution’ Here, shared robo-taxis would still be a primary mode of mobility with every taxi carrying an average of two individuals. This results in 54 per cent more free parking space and also lowers the number of cars needed to transport the population by 59 per cent. Accidents also decrease by 87 per cent.   However, after laying out all these scenarios, BCG makes it clear that “no single scenario will play out exactly as described,” Michael Rüßmann, a BCG senior partner and report co-author says.   “Our analysis makes it clear that the potential benefits for society are huge if SDVs are combined with ride-sharing and electrification… A power train shift from internal-combustion to electric engines is essential if cities want to cut tailpipe emissions and ride-sharing in urban areas is required to reduce the number of vehicles that are on the streets at any given time. Autonomous capabilities are the key to big improvements in road safety. These three factors – ride-sharing, autonomous driving and electrification – reinforce each other to facilitate fast adoption,” he adds.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise Where are My AMP Pages in the Search Results? SEO May 18, 2016 SEO Anna CroweMay 18, 2016 SEJ STAFF 556SHARES 4.4KREADS 556SHARES 4.4KREADS SEJ STAFFAnna Crowe 556SHARES 4.4KREADS Two months ago, the internet blew up over Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages). And, just when you thought you passed the Structured Data Testing tool and implemented your AMP HTML file extensions perfectly, you realize your AMP pages are not showing up in the search results. Are you asking: Where are my AMP pages in the search results? Does AMP happen in real-time? Or, does it take a few hours for Google to index your AMP pages? Well, take comfort in knowing you are not alone. Yep, the SEJ team is right there with you. In true early adopter fashion, SEJ launched our AMP pages on March 29. Since the launch, we have seen traffic to our AMP pages spike from 50 to 700 sessions. High-fives all around! As you can see below in our breakdown of AMP traffic, the majority of our traffic is coming from play.google.com/newsstand. However, when we search in the search results, our AMP pages are nowhere to be found. Sound familiar? Others are having the same issue. So, it’s no wonder that only 25% of SEO professionals have taken steps to implement AMP. And, while there may be more legwork involved in creating AMP pages, Google has created a new problem: With countless hours spent, it’s hard to know when and where your AMP pages exist in the SERPs. To help you cut through the noise, we’re going to share our experience here at SEJ. But, first, let’s give you some insight on how we assembled our AMP pages at SEJ. Implementing AMP For implementing AMP, Vahan Petrosyan, our lead developer here at SEJ, used the following plugins: AMP Glue for Yoast SEO & AMP But, you will likely need a little more than a plugin if you want to implement AMP. Here is what Vahan had to say about using plugins alone: “Simple installation of plugins gives only standard and limited functionality of customizing posts. I did custom development using that plugins actions hooks and modified standard look for our AMP pages. We modified styles, added slide menu from right using pure CSS3 techniques, sticky share buttons,and modified Google Analytics default tracking code in order to include custom dimensions and event tracking such as share buttons, menu items clicks,etc.” Here are screenshots of the sleek reading experience on mobile: ADVERTISEMENT We’re excited about the new look and interested to see how it affects traffic. Where are My Google AMP Pages? Restructuring your mobile website to cater to Google’s new features is just part of the job description when you launch a website, right? But as we’ve come to learn, the theory “build it and they come” isn’t so true. Based on our experience at SEJ, Google AMP pages are not real-time. Since we launched our AMP pages on March 29, 2016, we have not seen them in the search results even though we’re getting traffic to our site from AMP pages. We noticed an uptick in traffic 9 days after launched our AMP pages. So, essentially it took Google 9 days to index our AMP pages. The SEJ team reached out to Gary Illyes to confirm this. Gary stated in a recent interview with SEJ, “In general the same applies on AMP results as on normal web results: we have to crawl and index the page in order to show a result for it. Depending on the site this can take from a few minutes to days, but most of the time it’s pretty fast.” One theory: While Google’s AMP pages are being praised as the fairy godmother to all the small businesses in Internet land, you may not see an immediate boost if you’re not first to implement. I’m noticing a large amount of the bigger publishers (mainly brands that partnered with Google in their beta testing) for AMP seemingly get first dibs in the Google search results carousel. Now, with Google News featuring up to 14 pieces of AMP content from publishers that have already launched their AMP pages, it’s going to continue to be a race to see who gets their first.  This could potentially hurt smaller businesses. Another theory: Google will only display news articles. These news articles will only show up in the AMP carousel if Google views content as recent news for the topic you’re searching for. The AMP carousel is a Top Stories carousel so perhaps your news articles are newsworthy enough for the carousel.  Google will only display Article, NewsArticle, and BlogPosting schema types into the carousel at this time. If you double checked your schema, head over to the Webmaster Central Forums and/or the AMP Error Reports in Search Console. You can also look at the new AMP filter in the Search Console. When the SEJ team asked Gary Illyes why we’re not seeing AMP pages expand faster outside of news sites, he responded, “The format itself is open to anyone who’d like to speed up their sites, it’s not limited to only one kind of site. Currently, we’re testing AMP results with a limited set of publishers, but we’re exploring ways to show AMP results from more sites.” Also, Google does not guarantee your articles will show in the AMP carousel. It depends on the searcher’s search query and Google’s algorithms of whether or not they display your content, even if you’ve passed the data structuring test and validated your AMP pages. We also asked Gary Illyes why AMP users are able to get traffic to their site via AMP pages but still not see their AMP pages in the SERPs, Gary stated, “AMP pages, just like normal webpages, can be accessed in many ways: from bookmarks, from search results, directly from the browser, an so on. If I know that a site is AMP enabled, I will very likely stick the “/amp” to the end of the URLs on the site, and so the publisher will likely see a direct visit in their tracking software. This is not necessarily what’s happening to SEJ, but that’s my best guess.” Editor Note: Come see Gary LIVE at SEJ Summit Chicago June 23 to hear more about AMP. What’s Next for AMP? For publishers, we simply wait. AMP pages are newbies to the SEO game. They are still trying to figure out where and how they fit into this crowded space. As Google continues to adapt and evolve their algorithm, the time and money invested will be worth it.   Image Sources: Featured Image: Georgejmclittle/Shutterstock.com Screenshots by Vahan Petrosyan.

UK Pondering Google Probe on Mobile Market Abuse, Windows Phone Possible Victim GO It’s payback time: Google faces investigation in the UK Aug 14, 2016 08:14 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Windows Phone users have been complaining for years that Google is abusing its dominant market position to harm Microsoft’s mobile platform, and it turns out that, in the end, their voice has been heard. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the United Kingdom is said to be planning an investigation against Google for the way it used its position as a leader of the mobile market in relation to the other companies that are part of the same business, and Windows Phone is believed to be one of the victims. Although a formal announcement is not yet available, WinBeta notes that Google has already been notified that the CMA is looking into the case and will try to determine whether the search giant has indeed made any abuse in relation to competitors or not. If you’re asking Windows Phone users, there’s no need for an investigation here because everyone knows that Google hasn’t actually been a big supporter of Windows, and with its decisions regarding the platform, it actually violated competition rules and abused its leading position. Google’s unfair strategy regarding Windows Phone How exactly did Google abuse its power? Windows Phone currently has absolutely no Google apps (aside from Search, which does nothing more than let you search the web, so nobody is using it), despite the fact that users have been calling for the company to release Maps, Gmail, or Google Plus for Windows Phone for years. Furthermore, titles such as Pokemon Go, which is based on the Google Maps API, aren’t available on Windows Phone or Windows 10 Mobile. By not releasing its apps on Windows Phone, Google could impact Microsoft’s mobile platform, but it’ll be hard to put together a case and fine the search giant just for not launching apps on Windows. On the other hand, there were violations that could be used as proof if such an investigation goes through, including the recent blunder that made it impossible for Windows 10 Mobile users to access Gmail on their phones. Google said it was all just a mistake and corrected the problem in a few days. And there were also minor things, such as serving Windows 10 users with Edge a WAP version of Google News, and not the modern version of the news service, so the CMA has a lot of research to do if it decides to put Windows Phone on the victim list. For the moment, we’re still waiting for statements from the involved parties, and expect more information to surface should the case go through. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Windows Phone#Windows 10 Mobile#Google subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Leak Shows Microsoft’s More Ambitious Budget Windows Phone Model Hack Lets You Install Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update on Unsupported Phones You'd Better Not Install That Pokemon Go App on Windows Phones Microsoft to Kill Off Skype for Windows Phone in Early 2017 iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    It's payback time for Windows Phone users New Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Estimator: Approximate the costs of a contract, as well as keep track on projects and clients with this handy application for the construction industry Shortcut Manager for PowerPoint: Easily assign keyboard shortcuts to the most used menu items, recorded macros and VBA code in Microsoft Office PowerPoint and improve your workflow PDF Protection Remover: Fast, easy-to-use and straightforward software application designed to help users decrypt and remove any protection from PDF files TimeLeft: Creates desktop countdown timers, reminders, stopwatches, stickers, and clocks, also providing auction watches and time synchronization options Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices Reader comments Load old comments   Windows Phones Will Run x86 Apps in Windows 10 Redstone 3 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Niantic founder and chief executive John Hanke has told a story of naming the company after a whaling ship abandoned in San Francisco Harbour by crew members who rushed off to seek fortunes during the famed Gold Rush. The ship was run aground and converted into a store. The notion of such long-forgotten wrecks prompted Hanke six years ago to use the name Niantic to christen a quest to combine gaming, mobile mapping and augmented reality to playfully reveal virtual things hidden in the real world. Niantic was a side-project for Hanke at Google, which had bought the entrepreneur’s startup Keyhole in 2004 and turned it into the free mapping service Google Earth. Hanke spent years as a top executive in a Google “geo” division producing widely used services such as Maps and Street View. The gamer wanted to go beyond helping people navigate and have fun with the ability for mobile devices to detect people’s locations. The entrepreneur toyed with the idea of launching a new startup, but instead kept Niantic anchored in the Silicon Valley technology powerhouse. “Staying at Google gave us the advantage of being able to tap into the data we have at (mapping division) Geo and the infrastructure of Google,” Hanke was quoted as saying in a 2012 Inc. magazine article. Portals to Pokemon The Niantic project fielded its first offering in 2011 in the form of a mobile application called Fieldtrip that served up information about where smartphone users were or nearby places of interest. The following year, Niantic launched a game called Ingress, seen as a predecessor to Pokemon Go. Ingress, which has been downloaded more than 15 million times, also uses real world surroundings as the game board. Instead of trying to catch cartoon monsters such as iconic Pikachu by targeting them with “Pokeballs,” Ingress players battle for control of virtual portals. Early Ingress fans submitted pictures of places as possible portals complete with satellite position metadata, essentially crowdsourcing a rich geo-location database that was put to use in Pokemon Go. When Google underwent a corporate restructuring last year to divvy its endeavours into arms of a freshly-created parent company called Alphabet, Niantic went independent. Google did invest in Niantic, as did Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Niantic claims from 50 to 100 employees. The private company does not make its financial information public but some analysts value it at more than US$3 billion (RM12.06 billion). To justify such a valuation, Niantic will have to prove that Pokemon Go is a lasting and profitable, not just another passing fling for notoriously fickle mobile game players. Pokemon Go has shown it can make money. Industry tracker Sensor Tower estimated that Pokemon Go generated more than US$200 million in revenue during the month after its release in early July. The game is free, but players can buy virtual supplies such as PokeBalls and lures to attract Pokemon. Cafes, pubs, restaurants and other venues have taken to buying lures that tempt players to linger, and hopefully spend money, while waiting to catch Pokemon. Sponsors During a recent Venture Beat technology conference, Hanke said that the game was designed from the outset for in-app purchases, and that revenue could also be made from sponsorships along the lines of what was done in Ingress. Ingress has portals hosted in commercial spots such as shopping centres, and Pokemon Go launched in Japan with fast food giant McDonald’s sponsoring in-game locations. “We are talking to a bunch of other businesses that want to take advantage of that model for Pokemon Go in other parts of the world,” Hanke said at the conference. “It’s promising.” A strong selling point for Pokemon Go sponsorships is that they get people swarming to places in a way that typical advertising does not. The power of Pokemon Go has, to some, become a bane. Parks and other public venues ripe with PokeStops or “gyms” where cartoon creatures battle are at times over run with players. Authorities have taken to warning Pokemon Go players against venturing where it is dangerous, illegal, in poor taste, or they are simply not wanted. The game and its creator are already in the sites of lawyers intent on suing to hold them accountable for trespassing or injuries involving players. The Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Centre has called for US regulators to investigate whether Niantic is collecting too much information about players and their whereabouts. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Facebook reportedly built a censorship tool for China (VIDEO) Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Twitter boss briefly suspended from his own network Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles ‘Star Wars Battlefront’ to receive ‘Rogue One’ update (VIDEO) Ambitious ‘Crowfall’ gets involved with IndieGoGo investor scheme Five standout video games in the history of Sony’s PS3 Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary Nintendo to offer special edition 3DS on Black Friday Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The Athlete challenged the decision rendered by the IAAF Doping Review Board (IAAF DRB) on 12 August 2016, which revoked its previous decision declaring her exceptionally eligible to compete in international competitions, including the athletics competition at the Olympic Games 2016. Such decision, declaring her ineligible to compete, was based on new factual elements concerning the Athlete presented by Prof. Richard McLaren in addition to his report delivered on 18 July 2016. On that basis, the IAAF DRB determined that the Athlete was directly affected and tainted by State-organized doping scheme described in the McLaren Report. Furthermore, the IAAF DRB noted that the results management in respect of certain of the Athlete’s samples has been subject to tampering and manipulation during the “relevant period” (i.e. starting on 1 January 2014). The CAS Panel in charge of this matter heard the parties and their representatives today between 11am and 3pm. At 1:00am today, the parties were informed that the application was upheld and that the Athlete remained eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio. The CAS Panel applied the IAAF Competition Rules to conclude that the previous decision of the IAAF DRB, that the Athlete complied with the relevant criteria because of her permanent residence outside Russia, still applied despite the additional information provided by Prof. McLaren. Relevantly, the Athlete established that she was subject to fully compliant drug-testing in- and out-of-competition outside of Russia for the “relevant period”. The full award with the grounds will be published on the CAS website as soon as it will be available. Darya Klishina will be Russia’s sole track and field athlete in Rio.

American guard Paul George admitted: Personally I felt we were going to dominate these games that they were going to come easy. But you start playing better competition, you see these teams are pretty good. Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski said he was unconcerned: At the end of the day, no one will ask you anything else except if you have won. While you are approaching that winning you are asked a bunch of other things. I think we are getting better offensively and we have to get better defensively. French centre Rudy Gobert was rather grudging in defeat: Today they did not play very well and still won so they are still the favourites.

He is, he told reporters, “so tired”: This has been much harder than London. The match in the final there was fairly straightforward in terms of the scoreline, whereas tonight anything could have happened in play, breaks of serve all the time, so many ups and downs.

To be honest, much about the scheduling of the athletics in Rio leaves a little to be desired. Bolt reckons he could have gone quicker than his winning time of 9.81 seconds had he been given longer to recover after the semi finals. Bolt told the BBC: After the semi-finals I felt extremely good. I wanted to run faster but the turnaround time that they gave us … normally we get two hours and 20 minutes – we got like an hour and 20 minutes. So we didn’t get any time to rest, to put our feet up and get the lactic [acid] out. We had to come right back out. It’s challenging but this is what we train for. Bolt, who beat Justin Gatlin into second place, also expressed surprise at the vociferous booing aimed at the twice-banned American before the start: I was surprised. It’s the first time that I’ve ever come out into a stadium and they [fans] have actually booed someone. It was shocking but I didn’t care about that. I’m here to perform and do what I have to do.

It was a pretty cagey heat, with Muir showing her speed in glimpses. She looks a pretty small, wan figure at times but there’s a snap in her stride. Making the final here aged 23 is a bonus for the new British record holder, who went sub-Holmes just a month ago. She will run without pressure in the final. It’s not impossible you know. And while we’re on just a word on Caterine Ibraguen in the triple jump. What an athlete! The stadium on that side is full of Colombian fans, flags draped over the rails, and she’s putting on a real show.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Google Nexus 7 2016 specs, release date with Android Nougat OS coming this month? Hercules Reyes Aug 15, 2016 10:09 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji)A Google employee poses with Nexus 7 tablets at a promotional event in Seoul Google is known for working with top mobile developers in order to produce its Nexus lineup of devices. Alongside the new smartphones rumored to be currently in development, there are some talks of yet another device that has been circulating in the rumor mill recently — the Google Nexus 7 (2016) tablet. According to the latest reports, the new tablet from the Mountain View-based company will be more powerful than last year's release and that it may be coming with all the other rumored Nexus devices this year. The new Google Nexus 7 is expected to be released sometime in the coming months, with some rumors claiming that the tablet would finally be released this month — which could be highly unlikely, seeing as the Android Nougat 7.0, the new version of Google's mobile operating system (OS), has yet to have a full public release. As for the possible set of specifications for the device, not much is known at this time, since talk about the Nexus 7 2016 in the rumor mill has been sparse. However, from what has been revealed, it is expected that the upcoming Google-branded tablet would be coming in sporting more internal storage capacity and bigger random access memory (RAM) capacity for more multitasking capabilities. First off, the new tablet is expected to come running under the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. As for the storage, it is expected to sport at least 4 GB worth of RAM and 128 GB worth of internal storage capacity, which could be expandable via an external microSD card slot. Just like the upcoming Google Nexus 2016 smartphones, the Google Nexus 7 2016 tablet is expected to be the first tablet device to be out in the market with the Android Nougat 7.0 OS. The two new upcoming Nexus smartphones, known in the rumor mill as the Nexus Sailfish and the Nexus Marlin, are rumored to be in development by Taiwanese mobile developer HTC. Meanwhile, no manufacturer for the new Nexus 7 tablet has been identified. Like Us on Facebook Hot News 'Destiny 2' may be set on Mars, featuring new subclasses of Guardians...

Various reports about its development and release date have been subjects of rumors and speculations all over the Internet. Previous reports suggested that Google's flagship smartphone will arrive in two models – the Sailfish and Marlin. According to the latest reports, Sailfish has been spotted on AnTuTu benchmarks.

Future of Social Network Coder-turned Product Manager's Musings On Social Network, Product Management and Startup Pages Home Social Media Product Management Awesome People To Follow Tell Me Something About Me Saturday, November 27, 2010 How To Bootstrap Your New Social Network What Can We Learn From Facebook and Disappointing Google Wave and Buzz? These days I seem to hear new social networking sites launching every other day: Social classified ads site Neezz.com, social site for college students CollegeOnly (I touched on them in my earlier blog), social group site The Fridge, open source privacy-sensitive social network package Diaspora, personal network site Path, etc. If you look at location-based social network (LBSN) only, there are dozens of them starting out following initial success of Foursquare. It seems like every website is either thinking about starting up a new social networking site or incorporating social networking feature into existing site. This got me wondering. Is there any lesson that we could draw from failed social network attempt, such as Google Wave and Google Buzz? What strategies can we imitate from Facebook and LinkedIn's success? What should be the strategy for new social networking site to bootstrap themselves? Here are 9 bootstrapping strategies that all social network startups should consider: 1. Find the niche user base Smaller, more focused user base will allow startup to cater the new social network site to their target audience. Start the site with specific use case in mind. In order to have specific use case, the site must focus the user experience on specific user base. Great example of this is Facebook. It first started out as Harvard social network, then expanded out to Stanford, Columbia, and Yale, and soon to all colleges. By focusing on college students, it was easy to cater the entire site to target audience. In addition college students are more likely to experiment with new sites, and this also helped Facebook build initial user base. This may be another reason why you see many social network sites starting up geared to college students, such as CollegeOnly and The Fridge. You could argue that this is what Google overlooked when bootstrapping Google Buzz. Rather than trying to build core user base, Google incorrectly assumed that users will flock to the new service if you placed Buzz right on the Google Mail UI. Their strategy was to target everyone from the day one. While Google Buzz had its values for some, not all Google Mail users found the value. User adoption of Google Buzz has been disappointing at best, and its opt-out way of targeting all Google Mail users was disastrous at worst. Funny, Yet Underscores Anti-Buzz Sentiment Cultivated By Importing All Google Mail Contacts For All 2. Provide value to the target audience Early Days of Facebook Users Spent Most Of Their Times Browsing Profiles & Photos Once focus user base is defined, the next thing is to decide on what values to offer to the user base. In reality, what value to provide is often the first impetus to launch social network site (like "let's build professional networking site" in case of LinkedIn). One thing to keep in mind when identifying the value is the target audience. The site must have a feature that has perceived value from target audience perspective. A good example is Facebook. Facebook started out as profile photo surfing site for college students. Facebook had clear idea of what to offer, and it understood college students will spend time surfing friend's photo profile. New social network site must understand what feature would be valuable to their target audience. Best way to do this is to build social network site for yourself. Just as Mike Zuckerberg understood college students need as a student himself, you are far more likely to succeed if you build a site for yourself. 3. Add signature user experience User experience is very important. Great user experience is to social network site functionality like great presentation is to nutritious food. Great user experience is critical part of the entire package. It used to be that websites were criticized by their available features (or lack thereof). But as more and more horizontal features such as user commenting platform, recommendation platform, and social connectivity platform are shared and available off-the-shelve, features alone can no longer be differentiating factors. In today's social network sites, user experience is one of the key determinants in appealing to users. Consider MySpace user experience. Although MySpace had its peak before Facebook did, MySpace failed to expand outside the core user base, and gave rise to Facebook. It's debatable that what factors have attributed to MySpace's dethrone, but I would argue that one key thing that MySpace failed miserably was user experience. Does anyone remember how MySpace user profile page looked before their UI makeover? MySpace Thought That It's Okay To Let User Sprinkle Confetti On Their Page; Maybe.  If Your Readers Are Colorblind... It's not surprising why MySpace had been hemorrhaging users. On the other hand, one good example is hipmunk.com. It is yet another meta flight search site, but with very refreshing user experience. It is perhaps the simplest air travel site that I've seen on the web so far. After easy calender day selection for departure/arrival date and airports, it returns available flights in Gantt chart showing layover and overall travel time. What a difference visual display of flight schedule makes. Add to this user experience, easy way to perform another search by adding a new tab to make similar searches, we have a winner. Hipmunk.com's Brilliant UI Showing Flight Schedule In Gantt Chart (It Also Made Ron Conway's 12-Startups-To-Watch List) 4. Make it easy to join; use Facebook, Twitter, Google ID When people visit a new social network site, one of the most dreaded part is filling out user information and creating yet another account, not to mention password. This new account creation is often enough to turn the prospects off and have them move on to the next distraction. I am not sure why websites think that having user create new accounts will be value to anyone. It will be the case that most of users, especially those who will be early adopters of the new site will likely have dozens of usernames and a few passwords they use (if they are security conscious), and dozens more that they've created, but forgot. Creating an account does no one any good. It does not guarantee any revisit any more so than you handing out business cards to total strangers in a parking lot. Instead use what's already out there. Allow users to sign up with your service through Facebook, Twitter and Google ID. Most successful social network sites do this, and more need to embrace existing user accounts. Support multiple of them depending upon your target audience. 5. Leverage Facebook and Twitter for viral advertisement Another reason to link with existing social network accounts is to leverage the social net to launch viral marketing. Remember seeing one too many Farmville updates from your Facebook friends? Do the same (of course with user's explicit permission). It will be unlikely that people will complain about too many of your new social network ad bits (that will be a good problem to have). If you are offering enough value as discussed in #2, people will in fact thank their friends who introduced it to them. Check out mentionmap of me. It visualizes the mentions of people and hashtags in most recent tweets. Oh, don't forget. They offer an easy way to retweet about them. Cool Visualization Of Your Twitter Network (Don't Forget The "Retweet" Button On Lower Left) 6. Make it addictive; add game elements or add games Building value, targeting the new site to specific audience, and making it easy to join with viral marketing are good start, but often not enough to have sustained growth. As new social network site, you'll need repeat hardcore users, users like those who propelled Zynga to billion dollar enterprise within 3 years of launch. Your service needs to be addictive for users to spend lots of time, and for users to spend lots of time, it needs to have game elements. 8 Out of Top 20 Facebook Apps Are From Zynga In Nov 2010 One of the huge windfalls for Facebook was Zynga's success. With Zynga's FarmVille, FrontierVille, Cafe World, and Mafia Wars popularity surge, Facebook was able to attract and retain those social game addicts. This explosive symbiotic relationship between Zynga and Facebook is something that Google has been working on to recreate on their social networking site. Game-like feature can be integrated within the site as well. Foursquare and SCVNGR are geolocation-based social networks (GBSN) that incorporated gaming aspects. Foursquare gives badges as you check in to places along with mayorship to those hardcore users, which encourages users to compete with others. SCVNGR has added challenges to GBSN so that users can engage in ad-hoc games when they check in at places. 7. Embrace third party developers by offering useful API While it is important for the site to provide core value for targeted audience, it doesn't have to do all the heavy lifting in creating additional values. No one has exclusive right to creativity, and certainly no one understands users' need better than the users themselves. When tools to integrate third party applications are available, and developers see the value in targeting the audience that you are attracting, they will build application to become the Zynga for your social network site. Take a look at iPhone app store and Facebook API. iPhone app store brought Facebook mobile application which is arguably why people are buying smartphone like iPhone. Facebook API brought Zynga games to be integrated with Facebook, and played a key role in increasing active daily user count since 2007. 8. Take risks to provide innovative feature When you have all of the above, you then have to innovate. It is far too easy for someone to come up with copycat of what you are doing already. Just take a look at all the Facebook wannabe startups just coming online. You have to take chances to innovate the existing features to provide more values, above and beyond the feature that you started out with. Facebook is a good example. Facebook started out as photo profile surfing site. Then it added innovative feature (some might call it evolutionary, but no one had it as well as Facebook), News Feed. The idea of making it super easy for anyone to subscribe to friend's news was a huge hit. Initially Facebook ran into some resistance from users, but they kept at tweaking its features and looks to make it de-facto standards of all social networking platforms. Facebook had their share of flops as well. Does anyone remember Facebook Beacon? What about overly simplified privacy control UI? But Facebook consistently took chances with new features, and reacted quickly to user feedback to continue improving their features. Facebook Had Their Share Of Failures, But They Reacted Quickly To Correct The Problem Facebook is continuing to innovate their core feature set by introducing Facebook Groups, Deals, and Messages. Not all of them will succeed, but they will be the first one to learn from the lessons and iterate on them. 9. Listen to user feedback, and iterate fast to increase the value-add Fast iteration is the key. I discussed in my earlier blog entry about importance of fast iteration especially when you are entering a new market. You have to listen for user feedback, and incorporate them into the feature as if it's coming down from board members. Ultimately it will be users who determine whether your new site will successfully attract and maintain critical user base.

It's a catch-22. You're definitely right about utilizing addictive game elements and social elements. Farmville, for example, isn't even a game. But people spread links for Farmville because their UI says stuff like "Robert needs your help building a barn" or other stuff like that to make you feel guilty. Other ways of jumpstarting your site include advertising on Facebook or even growing your Facebook page on GetMorePopular and other techniques. Facebook is clearly the best place to grow your site because when people post about something all of their friends see it.ReplyDelete Harold FowlerNovember 29, 2010 at 2:35 PM Wow, that makes a lot of sense dude. www.real-privacy.edu.tcReplyDelete AnonymousJanuary 10, 2011 at 8:08 AM the mentionmap is sweet!

Images edited by Tetyana Lokot. On July 27 Internet giant Google renamed a number of towns, villages, and settlements in Crimea—a peninsula in Ukraine that has been under Russian control since early 2014—on their Google Maps service. The change came after the Ukrainian parliament altered the names of 70 geographic locations in Crimea in accordance with its “decommunization” campaign in May 2016. Users of the Russian and Ukrainian versions of Google Maps noticed the differences immediately. For instance, according to a report by Meduza news website, the town of Krasnoperekopsk became “Yany Kapu,” Sovetskoe turned into “Ichki,” and Kirovskoe was changed to “Islyam-Terek.” Many of the new names have Crimean Tatar origin or other historic roots, replacing the Soviet-era variants. The change on Google Maps immediately provoked a backlash from Russian and Crimean officials. The head of annexed Crimea Sergey Aksyonov accused Google in a Facebook post of “producing a propagandistic product” and of “trying to create their own reality.” Russian communications minister Nikolay Nikiforov also joined in the criticism, saying that if Google didn't stick to Russian laws and the Russian names of towns and villages (in Crimea), it would “prevent the company from doing effective business in Russia.” Ukrainian foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin reacted to the backlash on Twitter, referring to what Ukraine believes to be illegal occupation of Crimea by Russia: Renaming the stolen is a house of cards: it is bound to collapse under the weight of truth. #CrimeaIsUkraine — Pavlo Klimkin (@PavloKlimkin) July 28, 2016 On July 28, a spokesperson for Google told RBC news website that they were aware of the changes made in accordance with Ukraine's “decommunization” law and of Russia's displeasure. Google told RBC they were “actively working to restore the previous version of the names on the Russian version of Google Maps.” The Ukrainian government lost control of the Crimean peninsula in the spring of 2014, following a disputed referendum on seceding from Ukraine and joining the Russian Federation. Most of the world does not recognize Russia's subsequent annexation of the territory of Crimea.

Greg Well as a consumer you can stop buying products and services from companies doing business with Russia! You have the power. I believe all peoples should at least stop buying from and Rissian based company. All profits are taxed and the money is used to invade and murder Ukrainians. Greg How would a company manage losing its customers if we stopped buying from Russian owned/based/financed businesses? LavXolm Now we need an alternative to Google… Crimea cities were founded by Russia centuries ago and was only capriciously “gifted” to Ukraine from Russia by Khrushchev in 1954. Khrushchev was ethnic Russian from Russian area of Ukraine and never intended for Crimea to be USA base to harass and threaten Russia or anywhere else. Cynical Google has stupidly fallen in with neocon regime change agenda and is doing evil! More evidence that an alternative to Google is needed. P.s. my grandparents were from near Crimea (Odessa) and it was RUSSIA then and will not be easily made hostile to Russia and Russian culture. Just watch… Shame, Google! MaximumOvertroll yes, im sure many czars and premiers would agree with your logic if any of their empires still existed, but the world has moved on. Pavel Bure Have you ever asked for a gift back from someone you gave it to? This might be common in Russia but not in any country I have been you. Pavel Bure Crimean government was seized at gunpoint and then with an sham election that wasn’t recognized as legal but the international community.

Its 120-watt One M Wireless Speaker (Amazon) has been sitting on my desk for the last few weeks, and like Sonos, it brings easy-to-configure wireless audio streaming to any room in the house. Raumfeld sent me two speaker setups to test, the aforementioned single speaker One M, and the Stereo Cubes — an option that delivers a wider sound stage. I’m still putting the Stereo Cubes to the test, but have used the One M for long enough that I feel comfortable speaking about its pluses and minuses. If you subscribe to one of the unit’s supported streaming services, and are aware of its shortcomings, then the One M can be an excellent pick. Let’s first address the elephant in the room. As of now, Raumfeld’s speakers don’t work with Apple Music or Google Play Music, although support for Google Cast is scheduled to land sometime soon. The lack of Apple Music support hurts, though, especially when Sonos, the top dog in the multi-room audio game, has it. It’s possible to stream music that you’ve manually synced or purchased from iTunes, and it’s also possible to play downloaded music from iTunes Match, but that still doesn’t make up for the lack of Apple Music support. Hands-on video Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more reviews Whether Raumfeld’s speakers will ever gain support for Apple Music is anyone’s guess. If Apple’s streaming service is an absolute must-have, then you’ll need to look elsewhere, at least for the time being. And keep in mind that these speakers do not feature AirPlay or Bluetooth support, so you can’t use either of those technologies as workarounds to play Apple Music. If you’re a Spotify Premium or Tidal subscriber, however, then the One M gets a lot more interesting. The benefit of an Internet-connected wireless streaming speaker is that the connection is between the speaker and the Internet. Thus, it can continue playing even if your phone leaves the network, receives a phone call, etc. Raumfeld’s wireless speaker model lineup Model Price Image One S $ One M $$ Stereo Cubes $$$ Stereo M $$$$ Stereo L $$$$$ Build quality and design The One M is a 5-driver 2-way stereo single-speaker solution that comes with a built-in down-firing subwoofer for awesome sound throughout the whole frequency range. The speaker rests on two feet that are positioned so that the high and mid-range drivers fire at a slight upward angle. The feet also serve to give the down-firing subwoofer room to breathe. At just a hair under 9 pounds, and dimensions of 16.1 x 7.9 x 7.1 inches, the One M is a solidly built speaker that will remain firmly planted wherever it is stationed. The speaker housing is constructed out of black or white MDF with a non-removable mesh speaker grill. Beneath the drivers rests brushed metal accents and buttons for controlling power and volume. You’ll also find four handy preset buttons near the bottom of the speaker for quick one-touch access to favorite Internet radio stations, albums, or playlists. One thing that I appreciate about Raumfeld’s speakers is that they are clearly designed to take a front-and-center role in the living space. With brushed metal accents and knobs, it’s a look that’s purposely designed to be seen and shown off. I’d feel totally comfortable placing the One M on my living room mantle, in my bedroom, in my office, or in virtually any other living space. Connectivity Although the Raumfeld One M is designed to work wirelessly, it does feature an Ethernet jack to connect directly to a router. I’ve tested the One M using an Ethernet connection and it worked well, but doing so disables its wireless connectivity. If you ever plan on moving the speaker around the house, you’ll want to stick with wireless connectivity for the most flexibility. Right above the Ethernet jack, on the rear of the One M, rests a pair of RCA line inputs. These inputs can be used for line level connectivity for an external device, such as a record player, CD player, MP3 player, mixer or other analog source. The great thing about the line input is that it can be shared across the network to other Raumfeld speakers in a multi-room setup. I’ll discuss that more in a follow-up post. Lastly, you’ll find a USB port for sharing music from a USB drive. The same port also has the ability to charge your iPhone. Raumfeld app If you’ve never used a multi-room wireless speaker before, it might seem strange that it doesn’t come with a remote. This is because your iPhone, iPad, or other smartphone functions as the remote. You’ll need to download the Raumfeld app to both set up and control your One M. The setup process is relatively easy, and involves pressing the setup button on the rear of the speaker cabinet, and going through a few initial steps inside the app. The Raumfeld app lends access to a variety of music streaming services, which include the following: TuneIn Tidal Rhapsody SoundCloud Spotify Coming soon: Google Play Music (Google Cast), Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer. As mentioned earlier, conspicuously missing from the currently supported list is Apple Music and Google Play Music. Considering that these are the two flagship music services for Apple and Android users, such omissions have to be carefully considered for anyone looking to delve headfirst into the Raumfeld ecosystem. The good news is that Google Cast support should be coming soon via a software update. Like the Sonos app, the Raumfeld app integrates many of these services directly within the app itself. This means that you can, for instance, control SoundCloud music and Tidal music from a single unified interface. Unfortunately, the same thing can’t be said about Spotify. Although you can control Spotify playback via the Raumfeld app, you can’t actually search for Spotify songs, or directly select which song you wish to play. To fully control Spotify, you’ll need to open the Spotify app and use its Connect feature, which is only available for Spotify premium subscribers. The app needs work… The app’s initial setup process is fairly straightforward, but I found that its navigation could use some additional polish. The app is too cluttered, and filled with nooks and crannies that give it a steep learning curve. I’ve also ran into occasional glitches and hiccups that forced me to restart the app to restore its normal functionality. This especially occurs when playing back music using Spotify, and attempting to switch to another streaming service. If you’re primarily a Spotify Premium user, then you won’t have to worry much about navigating around the Raumfeld app, since Spotify playback is managed via its own app. Of course, you’ll still need to use the Raumfeld app to control speaker settings, adjust equalizer settings, rename the speakers, disable LED indicator lights, etc. …but it has potential That’s not to say that the app is terrible, because it’s not. If you’re a Tidal user, then you’ll enjoy the fully integrated experience with that particular music service. You can also mix and match songs from multiple music services to combine them into a single playlist that plays back as if it were all coming from one source. Of course, the most glaring flaw with the entire Raumfeld ecosystem is the lack of support for two of the top streaming services — Apple Music and Google Play Music. I’m not trying to sound like a broken record, but if Raumfeld hopes to compete in a space traditionally dominated by Sonos, it needs to eventually rectify this issue. Sound quality is ridiculously good If there’s one thing that the One M excels at over everything else, it’s easily the sound quality. The sound pumped out of the One M’s 5-driver setup is seriously impressive. Even at low volume levels, the speaker filled my entire office with crystal clear sound. Not only does the One M push forth clear highs and mids, but you get awesome low end sound thanks to the built-in down-firing subwoofer. The sub, as you might imagine, makes a world of difference when compared to similarly-sized speakers that lack such a feature. That said, it’s best if you can place the unit in a corner to hear (and feel) the full benefit of the subwoofer. The One M gets super-loud, certainly louder than my ears could stand when I cranked the volume dial all the way up. Although I was satisfied with the out-of-the-box sound, I did opt to widen the sound stage — a preference found inside of the app’s settings. Out of the box, the sound stage is a bit narrow, which may be noticeable depending on speaker placement and room size. The bottom line is that One M’s sound quality is phenomenal, which goes a long way towards making it easier to overlook the app’s shortcomings. An app can be improved and iterated on, while the speaker hardware can not. Fortunately, Raumfeld got it right on the first try hardware-wise. Preset buttons The front panel of the One M features four preset buttons that can be assigned to specific albums, playlists, or radio stations. For example, while listening to a radio station on TuneIn, simply press and hold the desired preset button for 3 seconds. You’ll hear a little chime to let you know that the preset was set successfully. Presets allow you to quickly begin music playback without needing to interface with your iPhone. It’s especially great for radio stations, but works fine for playlists across many of the music services registered in the Raumfeld app. Sadly, there’s no way to skip tracks or go back to the previous track without launching the app, which seems like a missed opportunity in my opinion. Conclusion It’s disappointing that there’s no support for Apple Music or Google Cast as of yet, and the app itself can be quite frustrating and finicky at times. The lack of AirPlay support may also be a deal breaker for many. That said, Raumfeld knocks it out of the park when it comes to the most important feature for a speaker in this price range: sound quality. If I’m just starting off with establishing a wireless speaker setup at home, then I’m seriously considering Raumfeld’s ecosystem, especially if Apple Music isn’t a prerequisite. The build quality, styling, and most of all, sound quality, make it a worthy Sonos competitor from a pure sound perspective. In a follow-up hands-on, we’ll discuss Raumfeld’s Stereo Cube speakers, talk about establishing a multi-room setup via the app’s preferences, and showcase streaming line level analog audio to other rooms. You can purchase Raumfeld’s One M from Amazon for $499.

The KFTC's statement comes as a surprise as a local news outlet reported that the KFTC had cleared Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, of all antitrust claims against the technology giant. It is alleged that Google requires mobile-phone producers to pre-load the company's apps on phones using its Android operating system. Earlier this year, the EU Commissioner of Competition, Margeth Vestagar [official profile], launched a probe [JURIST report] in regards to the same matter. Google has faced numerous legal suits both in the US and internationally. In 2015 the EU filed an antitrust claim [JURIST report] against Google claiming that Google structures its search results to favor its own services over those of rivals. Earlier that year, privacy software company Disconnect [corporate website] filed antitrust charges [JURIST report] against Google with the European Commissioner. That January a representative for Google signed an agreement [JURIST report] to rewrite the company's current privacy policy in response to pressure from the UK Information Commissioner's Office [official website]. Also in January of last year Google was among four tech companies that reached a $415 million settlement [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit claiming the companies unlawfully agreed to reduce employee compensation and mobility. A Hong Kong court ruled [JURIST report] in August 2014 that Chinese businessman Dr. Albert Yeung Sau Shing may continue his defamation suit against Google over the autocomplete function of the company's search engine, which suggests links connecting Yeung to organized crime groups in China. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [official website] ruled [JURIST report] in May 2014 that programming interfaces in Oracle's Java technology can be protected under US copyright law, allowing Oracle to pursue its legal case against Google.

The general concern is that with Google’s long list of apps on their phones it makes it hard for local competitors to compete. Why would you look for something else when it already exists on your phone? In China they faced a similar situation and pulled their apps allowing local developers to create and succeed instead of only seeing American companies dominate the market. Google’s decision on policy moving forward will be very telling. If they change their policies they will find themselves not competing in two of the largest markets.

We don't really care if you have a 4.0 GPA, and we're not interested in whether you can figure out how many golf balls fit inside a 747. But here's what we do look for in engineering candidates in 2016—and why we look for it. 1. Don't Disqualify Yourself Preemptively Recent experience has taught us that we can find great tech talent in a much wider range of places than previously thought. For one thing, there are far more qualified college applicants than there are spaces for them at top universities. And for another, computer scientists aren't always aware of their talent for coding by the time they’re 18 and have to declare a major. Give us details about your experience at hackathons, coding competitions, or programming assignments at work. Google is also trying to challenge some of the industry's stubbornest stereotypes about what computer scientists look like and do in their spare time. Our Google in Residence program, for instance, embeds Google engineers at historically black colleges and universities to teach computer science and coach students about how to position themselves for engineering careers. We have similar initiatives in the works aimed at improving Hispanic diversity, too. It's important to know this because, too often, the tech sector's well-documented demographics are enough to discourage some of the best talent from imagining themselves as future Googlers. My job is to help change that; your job is to apply. More broadly, Google’s CS in Education initiative works to develop programs, resources, tools, and community partnerships to make computer science accessible to more students during their formative educational years. The goal is to make sure tomorrow's tech industry mirrors the demographics of the people it actually serves. In the meantime, don't assume you're unqualified on the basis of your educational, professional, or personal background and decide against applying (or, for that matter, let self-doubt get the better of you when you do show up for an interview). Trying to land a competitive tech job is daunting, but it's only impossible if you don't compete. 2. Show Us What You Can Do—Even If You Didn't Learn It In School Yes, engineers need to be able to code. But we're interested in hiring actual people, not machines. So on your resume, instead of listing your GPA (which we no longer use to determine candidacy), give us details about your experience at hackathons, coding competitions, or programming assignments at work. Just because it isn't an academic credential doesn't make it any less relevant. Not only does this create a more textured portrait of your abilities, it’s a great way to prove your engineering chops if you majored in sociology, for instance. 3. Get Comfortable With Coding Exercises Now for the obvious part: It goes without saying that engineers need to be able to code, so intensive preparation for the coding exercise—the centerpiece of every Google engineering interview—is a must. Candidates should be able to answer three coding questions from scratch (without the help of a library function) within 45 minutes. I also suggest practicing with a live person, whether they’re technical or not. And try going analog—use a whiteboard or a blank piece of paper. And focus in particular on algorithms and data structures. There are some great samples in Cracking the Coding Interview, Topcoder, and LeetCode. 4. Remember What Got You Noticed In The First Place It's equally important is to keep a lookout for "impostor syndrome," certain high achievers’ tendencies to discount their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a "fraud."

While this is a completely normal response, it's a counterproductive mind-set while you're gunning for a tech position. I've seen it get the better of candidates and completely derail an interview. You might not put relaxation techniques at the top of your checklist for tech-interview prep, but they should be there. Here's a tip: Consider thinking out loud while you complete the coding exercise. Not only can that help you own the task at hand and stay calm under pressure, but this level of transparency helps your interviewer understand how you think. And why wouldn't you want that? After all, if you’ve made it to the interview, you can be confident that someone on staff already believes in your abilities. Keawe Block is a recruiter at Google.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google’s secretly working on a new OS called Fuchsia Software Google’s secretly working on a new OS called Fuchsia By Bindu Nair - While Android 7.0 Nougat has been grabbing headlines for the past few weeks as Google’s next big OS launch, a new report claims that the company is secretly working on another operating system. From the looks of things, the software isn’t just an upgraded version of Android or Chrome OS but a brand new platform in its own right. Google has already set up a GitHub page for the OS with the tagline ‘Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).’ This doesn’t give much away in terms of details, which is why a bit of digging is required to get an idea of what the brand might be planning with the software. The most striking thing about Fuchsia is the fact that it’s not based on the Linux kernel. All of Google’s operating systems till date have been powered by the latter. However, one of Linux’s major drawbacks is that it’s not suited for all devices, especially embedded ones like car dashboards or GPS units where it could impact performance. Also Read: Google’s Verify Apps feature protects 90% of Android devices against QuadRooter This is where Fuchsia steps in. The OS utilizes the Magenta kernel which is being crafted as a competitor to commercial embedded OSes like FreeRTOS or ThreadX. Magneta is more advanced than the other two by virtue of being able to scale up to smartphones and desktops as well. Google may further be using Flutter for the UI and Dart as the main programming language. Interestingly, Fuchsia might also take advantage of Escher, a renderer which supports visual effects such as soft shadows and light diffusion. The company’s Material Design UI notably uses shadows and delicate color reflections as part of its style. Android Police theorizes that Google is working on Fuchsia in order to one day replace Android and Chrome OS. Another exciting hypothesis could be that it’s simply working on the OS as a lightweight alternative for hardware not optimized for Android. The search giant already has a range of embedded hardware like the OnHub router and Google Home. It stands to reason that Google is working on Fuchsia as a dedicated OS for such devices. However, there’s a chance this is all simply an experiment which may never be commercially launched. After all, Android has become ubiquitous with the Google brand name and there’s no reason why the firm would want to undertake such a massive refresh.

Ennis Hill starts quick and is 5m ahead after 100m. Thiam is trailing at the back but we expected that. The gap between the two is around 5.5 seconds at 400m, Ennis-Hill still leads the filed at 600m and Thiam is fading. It will be very close, she comes home in 2:08. I think Thiam has done just enough, she gave everything at the end and found the extra second or so she needed. It was a personal best from the Belgian.

I didn’t see anyone out there who was unbeatable. I was down in fourth and I’ve managed to come out and get myself a medal, but I came into the championships to win, I’m not here to finish third and it’s very very frustrating. I gave it absolutely everything I could to take it back (the gold), I felt I could but it wasn’t to be. Two Olympic medals in my career isn’t too bad, but I really wanted it tonight, I really wanted to retain that title.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.56pm EDT 21:56 The final event of the night now. The heptathletes drag themselves to the end of the road - a road that ends with an 800m run, which doesn’t seem very fair. The first heat doesn’t contain any of the contenders for gold. USA’s Miller-Koch wins by a huge distance but she won’t trouble top of the podium.

He made a blistering 1.43.88sec seem like a training run in the 800m semi-final, that silky long stride eating up the Rio track. Rudisha looks unstoppable, but whether he can better his 1.40.91 world record from London 2012 is an open question. Clayton Murphy of the US road his coat-tails and produced the run of his life with a personal best of 1.44.30 to qualify for the final.

Google Working on New OS That's Not Android, Chrome OS, or Linux-Related GO New OS is most likely intended for IoT devices but can also work with desktops, laptops, and smartphones Aug 13, 2016 21:05 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has been quietly working on a new project called Fuchsia, a standalone operating system that has nothing in common with Android and Chrome OS, the company's own operating systems, or with Linux, from where Google previously borrowed some parts of the kernel and used them in the Android project. Before you go googling for the word, fuchsia is a flower, which also gives the name of a color. This is important because the Fuchsia project itself is described like this: "Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)." Fuchsia is most likely destined for the IoT market As for technical details, the project uses a custom kernel called Magenta, based on LK (LittleKernel), a project designed for usage on embedded systems, usually IoT devices. Google has IoT products on the market like OnHub and Google Home, for which no doubt it will be looking to run an uniformized firmware platform via its new Fuchsia project. But Fuchsia is not meant for IoT devices alone, and the project can run on other types of platforms as well, like smartphones, tablets, and regular PCs. Even if a US judge has ruled in favor of Google in its lawsuit with Oracle over the usage of Java in Android, it's good to know that Google has a backup project, just in case the company doesn't agree with the idea of paying royalties for Java (more accurately, Java's APIs). Based on discussions in Fuchsia's IRC channel, the company will soon add Raspberry Pi 3 support as well. Fuchsia is open source Some of the big names working on the project include Travis Geiselbrecht (NewOS, Danger and BeOS) and Brian Swetland (BeOS). Just like Android, the project has been open-sourced in its entirety. Despite some rumors having Fuchsia running on Dart, the project is written in C and C++. There are currently two repositories for the Fuchsia OS, hosted on GitHub and Google Source. We'll be covering this topic in future stories.

Their efforts range from getting voters registered to giving their own employees time off to cast ballots. The push comes as tech is getting more comfortable engaging in politics and as industry-watchers closely look for any hints of political bias. ADVERTISEMENT Tech's efforts are taking a number of forms, as companies nudge the public to register in time. Last Saturday, Airbnb celebrated the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act with a message on its U.S. website, encouraging visitors to “Join us in celebrating this historic day by registering to vote.” “Airbnb hosts and guests are engaged in the communities they call home and we believe that everyone should be able to participate in the crucial conversations that will shape the future of our country,” the company said. Google, meanwhile, added voter registration information, including registration deadlines and step-by-step directions, directly to their search pages this summer. Several companies — including Airbnb, Lyft and Salesforce — have made a "nonpartisan, long-term commitment to increase voter participation" as part of the new "TurboVote" challenge. Rock The Vote has also partnered with Microsoft, Twitter and dating app Tinder. Matt Mahan, the CEO of Brigade, which develops social networking applications for voters, praised the efforts of companies to get involved in civic life. "I think that’s a really positive development and its high time,” he said. Alongside registration efforts, a growing movement is pressuring tech companies to give their employees time off to vote. Hunter Walk, a venture capitalist who is a supporter of the cause, said the hope is companies will view providing time off to vote as an important cause rather than a legal requirement, as it is in some states. He said he hopes executives will come to say, "‘Hey, this matters, we’re going to remind you and make it more of a norm rather than just trying to accommodate those of you who wish to participate.' " This line of thinking is gaining traction. Spotify US, Twilio and TaskRabbit are among more than 175 companies who have signed on. “Unfortunately, Election Day is not a federal holiday in the United States, making it difficult for many people to take time off from their jobs to vote,” payments company Square said in a post last week. “That’s why we’re making Election Day a company holiday.” Politics have always been a complicated business for tech companies — and the new voter participation efforts come at a time when questions about ideological bias in Silicon Valley are increasingly common. Earlier this year, Facebook moved quickly to address allegations its "Trending Topics" feature discriminated against right-leaning views, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg sitting down with prominent conservatives. Google has been similarly aggressive about quashing any claims of bias. But the voter participation efforts are also a part of tech companies' new openness to political action. Major technology companies spend handily on advocating for favorable policies around the country. Google’s parent, Alphabet, spent more than $16 million last year on federal lobbying and Facebook spent almost $10 million, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Companies have similarly become more comfortable with civic engagement. Google launched an application programming interface with information on elections and government ahead of the 2012 election and Facebook has for years reminded users to vote at the top of their News Feeds. Registering voters may have once been seen by companies to be a political act — and therefore off limits — but those views are changing. “I’ve been doing this for twelve years, it’s never happened,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, about corporations aggressively looking to partner with her group. “I usually have to knock on the door and make the case.” Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said getting involved with voter participation was in line with the mission of many tech companies. “The democratization of information is a core mission of internet companies, and efforts to help voters get to the polls reflects this commitment,” he said in an email. Political outcomes can often have a real impact on a company's financial success. Many Silicon Valley companies — including Airbnb, Lyft and Uber — now find that they have to overcome tough political and regulatory challenges by mobilizing their users. But several people interviewed rejected the idea that tech companies’ voter engagement efforts were simply motivated by their own political goals. Jen Tolentino, who leads Rock The Vote’s technology efforts, said that their intent wasn't to help those companies mobilize voters for their own political fights. Walk said the efforts to boost civic involvement are linked to the growing political activity at tech companies, but aren't a cover. “I guess, in my mind, they’re certainly related — but it’s an embrace of the need to engage with the political system in general rather than sort of [saying] ‘Let’s get all these people engaged under the guise of an election and then if a politician messes with us we’ll turn these people lose on their office,’” he said. The debate is unlikely to be resolved any time soon, as the role of tech companies in daily life grows and the industry's political efforts expands. Mahan said if companies could boost civic participation in a "nonpartisan and quote unquote safe way," Silicon Valleycould take bolder steps to turn people out to vote. "Then I think we can get creative,” said Mahan. “I think we can put voter registration forms in peoples’ onboarding packets. We can put registration and voting deadlines on the company calendar.”   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa. View the discussion thread.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Aug 13, 2016 at 2:04PM Image source: Getty Images No book has had a more profound impact on my investing than Nassim Taleb's Antifragile. It argues that the entire world can be broken into three categories: The Fragile: things that break as soon as stress is applied -- like a glass falling off of a table. The Robust: things that stay absolutely the same under stress -- a rubber ball falling from the same table. The Antifragile:things that become more powerful when stressors are introduced -- think of how your bone heals back stronger than before after it's broken. We want our portfolios to be as antifragile as possible. But we often fail at this. That's largely because we are suckers for the narrative bias: We tell ourselves a story about a company: how its sales will grow and its products will revolutionize the world, and we invest accordingly. I created a compelling narrative for the first stock I ever wrote about for The Fool six years ago. Since then, that stock has trailed the market by a whopping 172 percentage points! By viewing the investing world through an "antifragile" lens, I eliminate the narrative bias by focusing on three attributes: Lots of cash and lots of customers: cash gives companies options during downturns -- outspending rivals, buying back stock, or acquisitions. Debt does the opposite. And by having lots of customers, a company doesn't run the risk of losing an outsized portion of business if a client walks away. Management with skin in the game: When the people running the company have their own skin in the game -- via shares of the company's stock -- their long-term interests are aligned with ours. That benefit compounds when founders are running the company, as they often view it as a literal extension of themselves. A barbell approach:This means having two sides to your strategy -- on one hand you have a business segment that has a wide moat. On the other hand, you take lots of low-probability, low-risk, high-reward bets -- a trait otherwise known as "optionality". The most antifragile company I know When I look around at the business landscape today, no company is more Antifragile than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- formerly known as Google. If I had to invest my entire life's savings into one stock, it would be the C shares of Alphabet -- because they are the less expensive of the two classes of shares. Let's look at the company through an antifragile lens: Lots of cash and lots of customers Alphabet has a massive war chest that just keeps growing. When cash and equivalents are added up with marketable securities, Alphabet is sitting on over $73 billion. At the same time, debt remains a pittance in comparison -- just under $2 billion. And the company's free cash flow is impressive and growing. GOOG Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts When the company brought CFO Ruth Porat on board from Morgan Stanley in 2015, it was a sign that management was getting serious about controlling costs and making good use of its cash. I don't think it would be a stretch to see the company start paying a dividend in the future. But for now, I'm content to know Alphabet is in such outstanding shape. Millions of businesses worldwide buy advertising exposure through Google, meaning if any one customer decided to leave, it wouldn't have an outsized effect on the company's bottom line. Management with skin in the game In 1995, Larry Page was visiting Stanford as a prospective graduate student. A current student -- Sergey Brin -- was assigned to show him around. Two years later, the pair started what become Google. Twenty-one years later, they are still at the helm of the company: Page as CEO, Brin as the leader of Google[x] -- more on Google[x] below. When the shares of Brin and Page are added together with those of the rest of management, the group owns 95% of Class B shares, worth over $35 billion. Some analysts were angered with the company's multi-tiered ownership structure, unveiled in 2013. In essence, the move made sure that Brin and Page would be the ultimate decision-makers in company matters. But given the choice between a democratic ownership that runs the risk of an outside force attempting to squeeze short-term profit out of Alphabet, and a benevolent leader calling the shots, I'm going to side with the benevolent founders. A barbell strategy The company's decision to change its name from "Google" to "Alphabet" is classic barbell: Page wanted to codify the difference between the search engine and all of the small "moon-shot" bets the company was making. The Google division simply mints money. With 89% of the global desktop search market, 95% of the global mobile market, and seven products that have over one billion users, Google has more data on hand than any other entity the world has ever known. That data allows the company to offer targeted ads the likes of which can only be matched by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) -- another very anti-fragile company. Given the market share and ecosystems that Google has created -- especially with the Android operating system and Chrome browser -- it would be very difficult to challenge Google on search. But Page isn't content to rest on those laurels. That's why the company's Google[x] labs focuses on creating technologies that solve some of humanity's biggest issues. Self-driving cars, connected homes (Nest), Google Fiber, life-sciences ventures (Verily), and even an attempt at greatly extending human life spans (Calico) are just a few examples of what Alphabet is trying to do. In the end, it would only take one of these ventures succeeding to make a significant contribution to Alphabet's bottom line. Over time, I'm hopeful that this will come to pass. But I'm not actually doing this Of course, it would be (small f) foolish to actually put all of my money into one stock. Even so, shares of Alphabet make up over 12% of my real-life holdings. The rest, of course, is spread out among many other companies. The beautiful thing about the antifragile framework is that it allows me to place those bets among other companies that share the same three traits above. I suggest considering this unconventional approach in your own investing life. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Google’s Plan To Bring 1000Mbps Google Fiber To ALL Revealed Know Your Mobile 8/13/2016 Know Your Mobile © knowyourmobile.com Google’s Plan To Bring 1000Mbps Google Fiber To ALL Revealed If you don’t know what Google Fiber is let me quickly explain. Google Fiber is Google’s plan to get insanely fast internet to everybody at a reasonable price. The big USP about Google Fiber is that it is SUPER fast, and by “super” I really do mean fast — like 1000Mbps fast. Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.13 -8.86 -11.66% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.88 -0.92 -0.82% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 775.27 -10.06 -1.28% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.43 -3.58 -9.18% To give you an idea of just how quick that is: imagine your “fast” 100Mbps connection now and how long it would take to download 100 photographs. The time for 100Mbps? Around 4 minutes. Right, get this: Google Fiber would do the same task in 3 seconds, making it up to 100x faster. This means you can stream 4K video effortlessly. In fact, you could stream 4K video and download six films at the same time and nothing would slow down. Make no mistake, Google Fiber is the biggest thing to happen to the web since, well… the internet began. Google Fiber is now up and in operation in some parts of the US, and if you’re lucky enough to live in a state with Fiber, you also get unlimited local and nationwide calling alongside some awesome TV packages. Basically, Fiber is a fix-all solution for those dissatisfied with current ISPs. The only problem? Google cannot get Fiber out fast enough. But according to a new FCC filing, the Big G might have a solution that could solve all the logistical nightmares in getting Fiber out to millions of additional people. Fiber is going wireless. Google is planning to conduct tests of a new wireless technology in California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia, which aims to bring Google Fiber to these places without the need for actual fiber cables. “In order to bring high-speed internet to homes without wires,” reports BGR, “Google would use spectrum much higher than currently used in wireless cell networks. It would use frequencies between 3.3 and 3.8GHz, most likely using line-of-site technology.” This is a technology current ISPs are using all over the world. It’s called fiber-to-the-neighbourhood (FTTN), but the benefit of Google Fiber is that it would be A LOT cheaper than current offerings for traditional ISPs. If the tests are successful it will mean Google can roll-out Fiber to every state in the US in a very short period of time, compared to how long it would take with a manual install of fiber cables across the nation. And the sooner this happens the better.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Android N release date for Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in October or November Hercules Reyes Aug 15, 2016 11:28 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Google)The new Android Nougat 7.0 is expected to arrive in the fall. The newest flagship phablet from South Korean tech giant Samsung, the Galaxy Note 7, was released carrying only the Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 version of Google's operating system (OS). The company recently promised that the device would be getting the update for the newest version of the OS, the new Android Nougat 7.0, in two to three months' time. The announcement was made by Samsung Mobile president Koh Dong-jin, according to a report by The Korea Times. The aforementioned time frame would put the release of the Android Nougat 7.0 OS sometime in October or November. Google is expected to release the new OS around the same time as well. "It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what's more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users," Koh said. "That's why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates." A number of other mobile developers have also recently announced the arrival of the Android Nougat 7.0 OS update for some of their devices, including ASUS and HTC — both of which are Taiwan-based companies. These companies have also made it known to their users that the latest version of the Android OS would be coming to a number of their devices initially, with more devices to receive the update later on in the year. However, just like Samsung, both companies were not able to give out a specific release date for the update. On the other hand, South Korean electronics company LG Electronics is the first mobile developer to announce a new mobile device that would be carrying the Android Nougat 7.0 OS out of the box — the upcoming V20 smartphone. However, Google's new Nexus smartphones would still have the honor of getting the new OS first. Like Us on Facebook Hot News 'Destiny 2' may be set on Mars, featuring new subclasses of Guardians...

There's nothing more than that, but Android Police reports that the Magenta kernel is based on the 'LittleKernel' project, and just like Linux and Android, the Magenta kernel is what powers the larger Fuchsia operating system.   Android Police says that Magenta is "being designed as a competitor to commercial embedded OSes, such as FreeRTOS or ThreadX." Magenta is designed to scale better, which will see it work on embedded devices, smartphones, and even desktop PCs. In order for this to happen, Magenta improves on the foundations of LittleKernel by adding first class user-mode support, as well as a capability-based security model.   For the UI, it seems as though Google is using Flutter, while Dart is the primary programming language. Escher is the renderer that supports light diffusion, soft shadows, and other visual effects, with OpenGL and Vulkan support included. Shadows and smaller color reflections are a big part of Google's Material Design, so Flutter and Escher could be designed for the Material Design UI.   It has 32-bit and 64-bit CPU support, as well as 64-bit PCs, so if you have the technical know-how, you could compile it yourself and get it running on your PC or even a virtual machine.   Why is Google working on Fuchsia, though? The company could eventually replace Chrome OS and Android with Fuchsia, which would see Google moving towards the way of Samsung, as it did with Tizen. Tizen was a lightweight OS that was made for devices that didn't require an OS as large as Android.   We should hopefully see Google talk more about Fuchsia in the future, but for now, what do you think Google will use Fuchsia for?

SUBSCRIBE Google officially throttling Keyword Planner data for low spending AdWords accounts Not a big AdWords spender? You may notice a lack of data in your Keyword Planner account. Greg Finn on August 13, 2016 at 8:00 am More Earlier this week, some marketers noticed that Keyword Planner data was displaying ranged data instead of precise search volume. The ranges were wildly broad, with results like “100K–1M” and “1M+.” Some wondered whether this was merely a glitch or if this was a calculated measure that favored higher-spending AdWords advertisers. Today, Google confirmed the latter. At the end of June, Keyword Planner was acting up, and many users got the message that they needed to have an active AdWords account in order to see the data. This, of course, drew the ire of users everywhere. Last month, a Google spokesperson confirmed with Search Engine Land that users do not have to have an active campaign to use Keyword Planner. However, just 13 days later, it now appears that you do need an active campaign for full data and that advertisers cannot have a “lower monthly spend.” According to Google, “most” advertisers will see Keyword Planner data as usual. But AdWords users with a “lower monthly spend” could see limited data in the planner. How limited? Very. The ranges that Google will provide for those with small (or no) spends makes the tool almost useless. The ranges that will be provided are: 0 1–100 100–1K 1K–10K 10K–100K 100K–1M 1M+ Another way that users may experience this ranged data is if they search for search data too often. This appears to be an issue that is specific to requests to the API. It should also be noted that there were, in fact, technical issues that were affecting Keyword Planner over the past few weeks. Those issues are now confirmed as resolved, but the restrictions are here to stay. For more information, see the official AdWords post and surrounding discussion. Image courtesy of Rustybrick.

The Facebook founder speaks fluent Mandarin, in which he regularly addresses Chinese audiences in speeches and online videos. His own Facebook profile has photos of him beaming while walking the Great Wall, jogging through Tiananmen Square and peering over the Terracotta Army. Zuckerberg, a keen diplomat, is constantly wooing China’s political leaders, and has been eager to secure praise from its tech chiefs. And yet, try to reach Facebook.com in mainland China, and instead of the social network’s familiar blue and white, you will be met with a blank page saying “this site can't be reached”. Since July 2009, when the social network was fingered as a breeding ground for protesters demanding independence in the north-west region of Xinjiang, Facebook has been shut off in China under the state’s programme of blocking websites that have been unwilling to co-operate with rules on censorship and surveillance. Mark Zuckerberg jogging in Xi'an Credit: Facebook Facebook is far from alone in living outside China’s “Great Firewall”, which also blocks access to Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia. The country, which now has the world’s biggest internet population with an estimated 720m users, has an online economy that is almost completely isolated from the rest of the world. Despite this, the Chinese internet would not be wholly unrecognisable to the Western consumer. To search the web, internet browsers can use Baidu, the country’s answer to Google. In the gap left by Facebook and Twitter sits Weibo, a cross between the two that more than 100m people log on to every day. For their fix of cat videos, the Chinese internet user has no need for YouTube when Youku Tudou does the job just as well. Outside China, Silicon Valley is relentlessly conquering the world. Facebook has 1.7  billion people logging in at least once a month – almost two thirds of the non-Chinese internet population. Google has seven products with more than a billion monthly users. The world’s five-biggest public companies – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Microsoft – all hail from hi-tech clusters in California or Seattle. The internet’s powerful network effects, and software’s infinite ability to scale, mean this small set of companies accounts for an increasing share of the world’s attention. So why does the economy that will be the world’s largest in around a decade elude them? Beyond the Great Firewall Website blocking is undoubtedly a factor in this. Google, which introduced a censored version of its search engine in China in 2006, had millions of users in the country before it reversed course in 2010. But it was already a distant second to Baidu, enjoying just a 35pc share of the search market, far below the practical monopoly it enjoys elsewhere. Just as significant as China’s censorship of the web is the reality that products baked in the California sunshine often don’t appeal to Chinese consumers, or are implemented so poorly that a copycat with local knowledge can easily dominate the market. There was no better example of this than the monstrously expensive, but ultimately doomed effort by Uber to dominate China, which came to an end this month. Almost everywhere else in the world, the car-hailing app  has got on the wrong side of taxi drivers and, in many cases, regulators, but has become the default way for young, social city dwellers to get around. Didi Chuxing has managed to beat Uber at its own game in China Credit: EPA In mainland China, however, it was dwarfed by Didi Chuxing, a domestic competitor with the know-how and local connections to beat Uber at its own game. Since Uber had set the wheels rolling on its Chinese subsidiary in 2014, it had lost billions, subsidising rides and handing drivers heavy bonuses in a bloody scrap for market share. But Didi had matched it yuan for yuan. Two weeks ago Uber threw in the towel. It agreed to merge its Chinese business with Didi, a partnership in which the American company will have a 17.7pc share. While the alliance was celebrated as a way for the combined group to end their brutal race to the bottom and finally make profits, it was hardly the surrender that Travis Kalanick, Uber’s ultra-competitive founder, would have hoped for when he first entered China. Uber was not able to blame the Great Firewall for its inability to repeat its success in Western markets. Neither was eBay, which arrived in China with great fanfare in 2004, but shut down only two years later. Alibaba – which at that point was a minnow compared with eBay – had beaten the American colossus away with Taobao, its own consumer auctions website. Amazon, the dominant web retailer in most of its markets, has repeatedly tried to establish a foothold in China but has largely resorted to partnering with domestic players. These are deep-pocketed companies, which are not used to running away with their tails between their legs, but the litany of failures in the country is starting to look like a pattern. A different internet It is not for the want of effort or interest. China’s internet-savvy population and rising middle class make it an ideal market. But when the internet’s giants set foot in the country, they have typically failed to understand its culture and habits. The mass internet in China did not arrive until years after the West, so many users’ first experiences with it was via a smartphone, rather than a desktop computer. This means that many of the services that were born on the PC – the email, search engines, even the web itself – do not form the basis of the Chinese internet. WeChat is a way of life for internet users in China Credit: Reuters Instead, life revolves around WeChat, a messaging app which became popular due to the prohibitive expense of texting. China is not alone in this – WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple’s iMessage have replaced texts around the world – WeChat is a far more advanced portal to the wider internet. It is used for shopping, peer-to-peer payments, and booking doctors’ appointments. The dominant smartphone manufacturers in the country – beyond Apple, which has been a rare US success story – are brands unfamiliar to most in the West: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. And the majority of China’s online payments do not directly go through credit cards and banks, but via Alipay, a service introduced by Alibaba more than a decade ago. Try to survive in China outside the bubble, as Uber did when it took its first steps into the country, and you may as well not exist. “Chinese companies almost all use Alipay and WeChat – if you come into the local market and don’t use them, you won’t work here,” says Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst at Forrester. “They have huge user loyalty.” Didi, unlike Uber, was able to build strong ties with WeChat, which many Chinese smartphone owners use to book transport, although the fact that WeChat’s owner Tencent is a major shareholder in the taxi app may have greased the wheels. But domestic operators have also proved to have strong stomachs for low prices and heavy losses, which have allowed them to compete with the invaders of Silicon Valley long enough to stand on their own feet. The rise of the Chinese internet giant “Chinese consumers are very fickle and aggressive in being price conscious; that leads to a very ruthless market, you see that across many sectors,” says Benjamin Kennedy, a managing partner at DealGlobe, a Shanghai-headquartered investment bank that helps Chinese firms invest in Europe. “It’s very hard for a Western player to come in who doesn’t understand the market and the consumer in depth and create a value proposition. Chinese businesses are willing to take really thin margins, even smaller firms will happily lose money in that battle.” The result of these ultra-competitive but loss-making Chinese businesses has been a spate of mergers, which has created domestic behemoths capable of standing up to their foreign rivals. Didi Chuxing itself was formed by the merger of Didi and Kuadi, which were China’s two biggest taxi apps. Youku Tudou, the dominant video site, is also a result of a duopoly that could not sustain itself. AT A GLANCE | Five Chinese internet giants Taking on these giants, which serve an enormous market, is a lot tougher than entering a smaller country where the incumbent cannot hope to compete. So will Silicon Valley, which dreams of a connected world without national borders give up on China, having spent billions there? The gargantuan opportunities there suggest not. Zuckerberg continues his courtship of officials. Google is once again hiring in the country, suggesting it could rekindle its efforts there. But Wang, of Forrester, says that domestic giants are now so entrenched that it is hard to see Silicon Valley players ever dethroning them. “I don’t think they’d have a chance,” she says. Kennedy says a better strategy would be to, as Uber has done, partner with a local player, citing the success of companies such as Volkswagen which have grown in China by establishing joint ventures. That may be so, but whether the utopians of Silicon Valley can swallow such a pill is another question.

Do autopilot critics have a point? Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   This still image taken from a video published on YouTube on Oct. 15, 2015, shows Joshua Brown of Canton, Ohio, in the driver's seat of his Tesla Model S with no hands on the steering wheel while he demonstrates the car's self-driving mode. Brown was killed on May 7, 2016, in Williston, Fla., when his car hit a tractor-trailer while it was on the Autopilot system. (YouTube via AP)   Brian Fung Washington Post     Another day, another crash involving a Tesla. On Wednesday, Tesla said one of its customers in Beijing was caught unprepared last week when his car, which had autopilot enabled, sideswiped another vehicle that was partially parked off the side of the road. The accident caused some damage, according to Tesla, but nobody was hurt. Tesla's analysis of the vehicle data logs showed that the driver didn't have his hands on the wheel. The driver doesn't appear to dispute that account, accusing Tesla salespeople of misleading him into thinking that the car had fully self-driving capabilities. Here's how Tesla described the crash in a statement to The Post: "The customer's dash cam video shows that the Tesla was being driven on a highway in China where a vehicle was parked on the left shoulder straddling the left lane. The Tesla was following closely behind the car in front of it when the lead car moved to the right to avoid hitting the parked car. The driver of the Tesla, whose hands were not detected on the steering wheel, did not steer to avoid the parked car and instead scraped against its side. As clearly communicated to the driver in the vehicle, Autosteer is an assist feature that requires the driver to keep his hands on the steering wheel at all times, to always maintain control and responsibility for the vehicle, and to be prepared to take over at any time." Given the number of Tesla accidents that have made the news in the last three to four months, it's vital that drivers fully understand what Tesla's autopilot can and can't do. It's not like one of Google's driverless cars, where engineers hope passengers will someday be able to push a button, sit back and enjoy the ride. Tesla's autopilot is much closer to a form of advanced cruise control. The autopilot feature was rolled out in October 2015. But unlike a fully driverless car -- which the government would classify as "Level 4 automation" -- Tesla's autopilot is designed to keep you within a lane, and from hitting other cars, under a limited set of circumstances. Even extreme heat or a misaligned bumper can be enough to throw off the system. Of the two companies, only Tesla is performing its tests on real-world customers, a decision that helped lead to that fatal Florida Tesla crash in May. To its credit, Tesla is generally up front in its marketing and user interface these days, reminding people that autopilot is a driver-assist feature, not a driver automation feature. For instance, to enable the automatic steering feature on a Tesla, drivers first have to click through a warning that appears on their car's screens. The language looks like this: "Autosteer feature is currently in Beta: "Autosteer is an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times. It is designed for use on highways that have a center divider and clear lane markings. It is also appropriate on other kinds of roads while in slow-moving traffic. It should not be used on highways that have very sharp turns or lane markings that are absent, faded, or ambiguous. Similar to the autopilot function in airplanes, you need to maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle while enjoying the convenience of Autosteer. "Please refer to the Owner's Manual for more detailed information about this feature. "Do you want to enable Autosteer while it is in Beta?" --- In its owners' manual, Tesla also lists a number of conditions that may thwart the autopilot system. At this point, you could say that anyone who fails to operate their autopilot according to manufacturer instructions is willfully throwing caution to the wind. But some analysts say that Tesla's marketing and technology may legitimately be responsible for creating some misunderstanding among certain drivers. For example, Tesla told The Post that its autopilot does not notify drivers with an audio and visual warning when they take their hands off the wheel. It only does so when the autopilot itself becomes less than confident about its ability to function safely. According to Karl Brauer, an auto analyst at Kelley Blue Book, that's unusual for the rest of the industry, whose advanced cruise controls tend to sound the alarm mere moments after a driver's hands lift off. Tesla's implementation, he said, may end up encouraging some Tesla owners to let their attention drift more than other car owners. "None of the other car companies besides Tesla seem to be having the same problem," Brauer said. "Maybe it's a big media overreaction. Maybe it is happening with everyone else. But we're not hearing about it. We're not hearing about Honda CR-Vs crashing, or Mercedes-Benzes crashing." Like Tesla and Google, countless automakers are investing heavily themselves in automation technology, whether partial or full. For example, a recent update to Ford's adaptive cruise control lets the car automatically handle stop-and-go traffic. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said that fully self-driving cars are coming much sooner than many people think. We may even get fully automated Teslas within a couple of years. All of that simply highlights how Tesla's current autopilot technology is not the same as full automation. Still, to many of us who don't work in the automotive or technology industries, it can be hard to tell the difference. That's why some think even calling Tesla's autopilot, well, "autopilot" is a big mistake. "By marketing their feature as 'Autopilot,' Tesla gives consumers a false sense of security," said Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumer Reports, last month. "We're deeply concerned that consumers are being sold a pile of promises about unproven technology." Even some who drive professionally for a living have argued that Tesla's autopilot branding risks misleading consumers. "With a name like that, is it any wonder that Tesla drivers might assume that the semi-autonomous driving system can just take over?" wrote CNNMoney's autos writer, Peter Valdes-Dapena, last month. Although Tesla puts its warnings in the owners' manual, he added: "How many drivers ever read the owner's manual? Based on most of the people I've ever talked to in the auto industry, very few." Even if a driver has read the manual, Tesla's marketing surrounding its autopilot feature makes it easy to blame the technology when a crash occurs, even if the crash data appear to demonstrate otherwise. That's certainly the tack that this driver in Beijing appears to be taking. Last month, a Tesla driver in Pennsylvania accused the autopilot for a crash even though it appeared not to be active at the time. And in another incident this summer, Tesla's logs undermined claims by a Model X owner that his car accelerated by itself into the side of a shopping mall. In all of these cases, as will become increasingly common in the future, investigators have looked closely at data recordings that show exactly what a car was doing in the moments before a crash. The data can help analysts pinpoint whether a driver had their hands on the steering wheel, how far the accelerator was being pressed, whether the brakes were applied and other information. Although authorities on the scene may perform an initial assessment of a crash and write a ticket or make an arrest right away, the data from the recorders can improve the odds of correctly assigning blame, analysts say. Humans tend to trust technologies pretty quickly once they actually get a taste of it, and understand what's possible with it. In the automotive space, we don't have to reach that far back in history to find a comparable example. "When anti-lock brakes first came on the scene as a technology, insurance companies were frustrated because their actuarial tables showed that people with anti-lock brakes cars were getting in more accidents," said Brauer. The results were deadly: A 1996 study backed by the insurance industry found that people were 45 percent more likely to die in a car with ABS than in a car without the new technology. While these findings understandably led to some initial alarm, the reason for the increased crashes ultimately boiled down to people becoming too comfortable too quickly with a technology they didn't understand. "Not only were they driving less carefully with anti-lock brakes on, but they weren't [educated] to properly utilize them when they needed them," said Brauer. That problem has since been overcome. But it took a great deal of driver education -- informing drivers not to expect too much of their anti-lock brakes -- and some revisions to the technology, such as eliminating the rapid vibrating sensation in the brake pedal associated with ABS that can surprise some drivers if they haven't experienced it before. So to see some drivers willingly giving their lives over to a feature that calls itself "autopilot" comes as little surprise. The very word conjures images of airliners that fly gracefully from point A to point B, all by themselves. Although the reality is often more complicated -- aircraft autopilot is turned on only under the appropriate conditions, and a real-world human pilot still must be prepared to take over if something goes wrong -- that's a detail many of us are all too willing to overlook. --- Factors that can stymie Tesla's autopilot Tesla's owner's manual lists several conditions that can potentially thwart the feature's ability to function properly. Some of them may surprise you. Here's a direct quote from the manual: Poor visibility (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.). Damage or obstructions caused by mud, ice, snow, etc. Interference or obstruction by object(s) mounted onto Model S (such as a bike rack or a sticker). Narrow or winding roads. A damaged or misaligned bumper. Interference from other equipment that generates ultrasonic waves. Extremely hot or cold temperatures.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study For the study the team analysed the data gained from quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. By: IANS | San Francisco | Updated: August 13, 2016 5:17 pm According to the study Microsoft, which is often perceived as less innovative than its rivals– Facebook, Google, IMB and Apple– has more innovative employees the other tech giants. (File Photo) Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said.

Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

According to the latest reports, the Google Nexus 2016 phones should be out this September. Apparently, these phones will not be the only high-profile handsets to come to the market. HTC is also planning to bring a fresh line of smartphones in the Desire lineup, this time, an HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle and an HTC Desire 10 Pro. If the reports are to be believed, the two HTC Desire 10 handsets will be out this quarter, but probably during the month of September – just about the same time Google is expected to unveil the Nexus 2016. Of course, both HTC Desire 10 phones are coming into the mid-range family and probably entry-level market, which means they probably get to go head to head with the Nexus 2016 Sailfish, especially the HTC Desire 10 Pro variant. The new handsets have very limited details doing rounds, especially the HTC Desire 10 Pro. But as for the Desire 10 Lifestyle, a report from Venture Beat says that the phone will feature a special metallic trim on the sides as well as around the lens of the camera, flash, and antenna lines. This is crowned by a matte finish and a variety of solid colors, giving the phones a typical HTC look. Coming down to the display, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle will pack a huge 5.5-inch display screen, but this will only manage a 720p resolution. Under the hood, the low-end Lifestyle will reportedly come with a quad-core Qualcomm processor, but there is no mention of the amount of RAM to expect. The back of the phone is said to come with a 13MP snapper and LED flash while the front will pack a 5MP selfie camera. Both lenses can record up to 1080p videos. Even though Android Nougat is nearing its official launch, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle will stick with Android 6.0 Marshmallow. As for the HTC Desire 10 Pro, there is nothing much to say about from the fact that it will be the top-tier variant of the two. If this is the case, expect the same size screen, but with a 1080p resolution, a mid-range octa-core processor, and even better camera specs. The rest of the details of these two phones are still unknown, but they should be out sooner than later, especially if the September launch date is to materialize.

 Why everything might not be 'great' at Google's $2.4 billion venture capital business Sam Shead Aug. 13, 2016, 3:45 AM 6,641 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Ventures founder and CEO Bill Maris is leaving.Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch Bill Maris, the founder and CEO of Alphabet's venture capital business, GV (formerly Google Ventures), confirmed on Thursday that he is leaving the company. When tech news website Recode asked the Alphabet exec why he's leaving the $2.4 billion (£1.6 billion) fund that has invested in 300 companies including the likes of Uber, he said: "I’m leaving because everything is great." But industry sources and venture capital researchers at analyst firm CB Insights questioned on Friday whether everything is as rosy as Maris is making it out to be. One venture capitalist, who wished to remain anonymous, told Business Insider that Maris's departure is a "huge signal something was very wrong there". "I haven’t heard any back story yet from my friends in [the] Valley but you have to think this was due to friction with Google execs," said the tech investor, before pointing to the closure of GV's dedicated European fund last year,. "He’s known for being abrasive and despite their rah rah culture it was without a doubt the 'Bill show' with everyone else in supporting roles. That’s why Wes Chan left, for example." These are only rumours and, as you might expect, GV has previously denied the reported tensions between Maris and other GV employees. Countering the rumours was Eze Vidra, a former partner at GV in Europe. He didn't have a negative word to say about Maris when Business Insider spoke to him on Friday, although it's unusual for a former Google employee to bad mouth the search giant. GV is 1 of 3 Alphabet investment funds GV was founded by Google in 2009 as Google Ventures. But the company no longer sits under Google. Today it falls under Alphabet — the parent company that Google created last year to separate its core search engine business from new ventures like GV, its secretive moonshot division, Project X, and home thermostat company, Nest. Following Alphabet's formation, CEO Larry Page rebranded Google Ventures to GV to make it clear that the venture capital business was independent of Google. However, to complicate matters somewhat for GV, Alphabet is also investing money through Google Capital and through an M&A team that serves all of Alphabet. That means there are three different subdivisions of Alphabet all looking for the hottest technology startups. Meanwhile, Larry Page is making personal investments in flying cars, and Google is supporting internal business efforts through a new incubator called Area 120. GV is likely to say that there's no overlap between itself and the other Alphabet investment divisions but it's perfectly possible that they end up treading on one another's toes from time-to-time. One startup cofounder even went as far as to say: "GV had no role after the Alphabet split." Looking at the data CB Insights looked at GV deal data over the last five years. The researchers found that GV made 46% less deals in 2015— the year that Alphabet was formed — than it did in 2014. A chart showing how many deals GV has closed since 2011.CB Insights The biggest drop-off in GV deal activity was at the seed stage, where GV went from a high of over 40 new deals in 2014 to 0 in the first half of 2016. The CB Insights researchers wrote: "Growth investments done through Google Capital and direct minority investments by Google into the likes of SpaceX and Magic Leap have increased in the past two years." Although GV is yet to make any seed stage deals in 2016, it has made several larger deals. In the first half of the year, GV made 31% more investments than the same period in 2015, but 30% fewer than in H1 2014, according to CB Insights. Ultimately, the success of a VC firm comes down to the number of big exits from startups in its portfolio. CB Insights notes that GV has had nine exits over $1 billion (£773 million) since its inception, with the latest one coming after Jet.com was acquired by Walmart for $3 billion (£2.3 billion). A Google Ventures spokeswoman said: "Bill Maris has decided to step down to take a break with his family and tackle something new. "David was instrumental in building GV into a 70+ person team with operations in Europe and the US, and over 300 investments. He led the fund’s investments in Uber and Nest. David has been with Google for nearly 17 years, starting as Google’s first communications director and taking the company through to IPO. Under his leadership, GV will continue to expand our mission to find and fund great entrepreneurs."

Back when they introduced this Social Network, Google had many big plans. However, over the years the company saw another of their attempts at creating a social network flop. They tried this with Orkut, Buzz and Wave. Orkut turned out to be a huge success in the South American and Asian nations, but never really caught on to the global markets. Buzz and Wave were dead-on-arrival. However, the Google+ project was highly ambitious. In their latest update, users do not need Google+ Profiles to post reviews on play store. This move comes a few months after Google disassociated other services from the social network. YouTube was among the first ones to go. Google Play Games too, got a major overhaul, and no longer depended on the Google Plus accounts. The company is slowly taking away features from their social network, possibly hinting at bigger changes over the months. It might also be possible that we might see Google+ shut down over the next few years. “People have told us that accessing all of their Google stuff with one account makes life a whole lot easier,” wrote Google VP of Streams, Photos and Sharing, Bradley Horowitz. “But we’ve also heard that it doesn’t make sense for your Google+ profile to be your identity in all the other Google products you use.” Google Plus recently turned 5 years old. However, the platform never became as big as it was imagined to be. Google is still struggling to keep things alive there. A large number of Google execs tend to post updates and upgrades on that platform, and a number of people follow them there, but apart from them, and a few users who are living under a rock, Google Plus is pretty much walking a slow march towards its end.

You can express your views with your regular Google account. The search giant has now changed its mind and policy as well. It is starting to eliminate the requirement, but very quietly though. Tech websites like Android Police and TechCrunch have confirmed the new change, which will be rolled out across accounts gradually. Several users have started reporting they are now able to post reviews on Google Play without their Google+ account. However, it is not yet known how long Google will take to lift the restriction across the world and for everyone. Let’s hope it won’t take much time. Apart from this the company has also nixed the “+1” voting. The change is not surprising as Google had recently shown distancing its major applications and services away its social platform. In July 2015 it removed Google+ from YouTube and in January this year Google announced to be doing the same for Google Play Games. New Gamer Ids were given instead for gamers thereafter to sign in and it was linked to the regular Google account.

This session was led by three educators from three different (non US) countries – Maha Bali from Egypt, Kate Bowles from Australia, and Paul Prinsloo from South Africa (Maha and Kate were really virtual, Paul was really on site at UMW). I’d urge you to read Kate’s deeply thoughtful follow-up post US/not us. I ended up yet again down another looking back / looking forward moment from one of their activities. I almost want to write a post at how effectively they created a session that was so participatory, but will focus on the one where they asked participants to add to an open Google Doc a response to the question “What kinds of images, names, people, issues come quickly to mind about the places we’re from?”. Even many years after my first live document sharing experience (before Google acquired what was then known as Writely) – it is still electrifying to be writing in the same document at the same time as multiple people in other places. I must admit my first thoughts for Egypt are terribly stereotypical. Charlton Heston in the Ten Commandments. Pyramids and Pharaohs. The Suez Canal. Arab Spring. Sometime tonight, maybe while washing dishes or dog walking, my brain totally remembered an experience with Egypt I had forgotten about. In the mid 1990s, I was working as an instructional technologist at the central office of the Maricopa Community Colleges in Phoenix, then fiddling with a crude early web, Hypercard, and Macromedia Director. I remembered a project we did when Jon Lea Fimbres, a counseling faculty at Paradise Valley Community College, left the system to join her husband who was appointed superintendent of the Cairo American College. Jon Lea left with ideas of projects she would do there. I think it was our center’s director, Naomi Story, who came up with the idea of asking Jon Lea to write some articles for our publication about her experience living and working in Egypt. It may have been my idea to do a web site about her experiences too but publishing a series of her emails back to us. Hence was born this vintage 1996 web site, with it’s HTML tables, font tags crude layout that still renders quite fine 10 years later — it was originally published at http://mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/mobius/egypt/ but as all my old web sites were mothballed, I reclaimed it and made it available at http://mcli.cogdogblog.com/mobius/egypt/. Okay, the Sphinx head graphic is so cliché — but it’s an original. At the time a student named Tony worked in out office, and he would use some Mac software I forget its name (it came in a real paint can) to create graphics for our projects. I think he picked the image. I enjoyed reading through some her messages, yes again, this is an American’s perspective in Egypt, but as a seasoned international educator, Jon Lea wrote insightfully of her experience. From her first message, September 26, 1996: This is a special moment! You are my first e-mail American contact! The internet is a fabulous security blanket. I am only a key-stroke away. … Thankfully we bought our computer. We settled on a Performa ( simple but effective and within our budget). As it turns out our school is installing fiber-optics and networking and up-grading…..therefore few computers are running at full capacity at this time. Having a home computer gives me a great deal of freedom and in a land of “different roles for women”, it is nice to have choices. … “Living” in Egypt has many advantages. We have been able to discover parts of Egypt that aren’t on most tourist stops. People are generous, kind and patient with foreigners. Egyptians seem to get a lot of entertainment out of watching and helping all of us adjust. They have dealt with intruders for thousands of years. I want to share this side of Egypt with you. It’s not a huge number of messages, about 11 from 1996 to 1999, plus 9 short articles she wrote for our journal. A “post” from Jon Lea in our MCLIU Forum publication, 1997 In February 1998, she wrote “Never Felt Safer” following a terrorist (before we called them that?) attack on tourists at the Luxor pyramid. The media was very quick to report the shootings and deaths of visitors to a temple in Luxor. That was important and tragic news. BUT what the media did not do is follow-up on the reactions and precautions of the Egyptian people after the tragedy. Within a day there was a national sense of mourning and grief. Throughout Egypt there was a personal, as well as, collective display of sadness and loss. There were many peaceful gatherings of Egyptians to show their concern for the families of the Luxor visitors and by gathering together peacefully, the Egyptian people were making an effort to remind us all that the terrible behaviors of 5 or 6 does not reflect the nature of millions. Shopkeepers were publicly apologizing, banners and signs were posted denouncing the violence and roses were gently given to visitors to show the compassion and understanding of suffering that the Egyptian people seem to naturally share with others. When an Egyptian greets you with a friendly, “Welcome to Egypt” it is a very genuine invitation to share in the pride and history of their amazing country. … Because of this strong sense of family and religious values and a legal system that has very strict, rapid consequences, I feel safer in Cairo living alone while my husband travels than I did in Phoenix. I know that everyone in the neighborhood is looking out for anything unusual and will take action against anything strange they see going on. There is not a strong sense of materialism yet, so most people are not coveting designer products and all of the gadgets of the West. … As I travelled home for the holidays, I was amazed at the concern of Americans about this region, while we as Americans seem to be increasingly numb to the regular acts of violence in our own country. While I was flying home I was reading a U.S. newspaper describing the tragic high school shooting in a prayer group, the holding hostage of 60 kindergarten students and the trial of the Oklahoma bombing suspects. It seemed ironic that my seat-mate was asking me, “How I could live in such an unsafe place like Egypt?” Has 2016 really advanced much from 1996? Jon Lea’s message from August 1999 brought up the importance of listening that was spoken much at UMW this week– I think I mentioned it in my message to her (which I did not think to include in the site, it was meant to be her publication space. But she did respond with sharing a listening poem “When Someone Deeply Listens to You” by John Fox When someone deeply listens to you it is like holding out a dented cup you’ve had since childhood and watching it fill up with cold, fresh water. When it balances on top of the brim, you are understood. When it overflows and touches your skin, you are loved. When someone deeply listens to you, the room where you stay starts a new life and the place where you wrote your first poem begins to glow in your mind’s eye. It is as if gold has been discovered! When someone deeply listens to you, your bare feet are on the earth and a beloved land that seemed distant is now at home within you. There was another work Jon Lea shared called “Welcome to Egypt” by an artist named ginda simpson Allah has willed that you live temporarily in Egypt. Submit. Like sunshine, Egypt will help you grow if you don€t pull down the blinds. Be discreet. Be friendly. Be sensitive. Hear the call to prayer. And pray. Laugh often. Drink Stella only when necessary. Never ask directions if you want to find your destination…When you drive, honk your horn. Remember that goats always have the right of way. Be a child. You are living in the world’s largest sandbox. Dust often or don’t dust at all. Discover freedom on a felucca. Remember that the mosque is a house of God. Be gentle to the donkeys and the children. Their lives are harsh. Fast at least one day during Ramadan. Then break the fast with a Moslem friend. There is still magic and mystery in this ancient land. Savor the moments. Again, I cannot assert that this is an accurate depiction of Egypt, as it is, via the words of a Westerner there. But as I read Jon Lea’s words, I feel she was rather proactive in exploring Kate’s “not us”-ness. And even if not a full picture of Egypt, it is much more than my meager set of movie/cliché Egypt associations. Last year I did connect with Jon Lea by email, she is retired in Tucson, and I owe her a visit. I might ask her to comment and reflect on her time there now some 10 years later.

The image, a bit stereotypical, was created by a student worked named Tony Zeka using a Mac software I cannot remember except that it literally came in a paint can. The post "Hello From Egypt (From 1996)" was originally zapped with 10,000 volts and declared "It's ALIVE" by Dr. Frankenstein at CogDogBlog (http://cogdogblog.com/2016/08/hello-egypt-1996/) on August 12, 2016. Sunset at 104 for Grandma Pat Choral Explanations and Leaky Faucets 6 Comments Kate August 13, 2016 at 3:13 am Reply Alan, there is just so much to absorb in Jon Lea’s stories. It’s taken me back to the email in the mid 1990s–that astonishment when someone emailed right back, and you realised that way on the other side of the world they were sitting at their desk, just as you were. This is really the magical sense of Taylor & Saarinen’s email teaching project detailed in their book Imagologies in 1994 — that two groups of disconnected students could be in touch with each other and with their profs through a means other than shared space. But what I love most here, and am so grateful to read, is the poem about being deeply heard. What extraordinary writing that is. “When someone deeply listens to you, your bare feet are on the earth and a beloved land that seemed distant is now at home within you” I’ve been reading Jean Amery, and in additional to writing about torture, he writes about being exiled and the question of “how much home does a person need?” This is something critical to refugees, exiles and the homeless, but also to all of us. Whatever seemed distant becomes at home in us when we are deeply heard. This is why for me there is no more profound pedagogical project than learning to listen well. I feel that it’s not just by being heard, but by listening, that we find whatever is at home within us. I realise that over the last few years, I’ve moved entirely from “what I am here to say?” to “what am I here to hear?” Thank you, your presence in all of this is profound for me. Maha Bali August 13, 2016 at 5:56 am Reply Alan – thanks for this, and for your kind response to our workshop design I’ve annotated your post to respond to “my Egypt” versus your friend’s – looking forward to hearing what you think of all that :) Thanks again for writing this https://via.hypothes.is/cogdogblog.com/2016/08/hello-egypt-1996/ Alan Levine aka CogDog cogdogblog.com August 13, 2016 at 7:15 am Reply Thanks Maha. Before I even read your annotations I hesitated to write knowing that even a well intentioned visitor to a cultural never has the insights of people of that cultural Maha Bali August 13, 2016 at 8:13 am Reply But trying is appreciated. I only annotated to help u imagine how I view my Egypt. Because even locals see different things. By location. By class. By education. I never saw the street sweepers until I was doing meals on wheels and distributing meals to them. Then they became EVERYWHERE Vanessa August 13, 2016 at 7:20 am Reply My own “hello Egypt” was massively transformative. Set in the mid-60s, it predates the internet as well as any readers under 50 as well. My mother, who learned much more Arabic in Egypt than I did and also used to look for those “separate but equal” schools in every small southern town we moved to in the late 40s through mid 50s, said everybody should live somewhere they were the wrong color. She was also big on learning the language everywhere we lived — that it was part of being a good guest and showing respect. PS Maha, I should included Stella with my Egypt free associations Alan Levine aka CogDog cogdogblog.com August 13, 2016 at 7:51 am Reply Your mother was so wise, Vanessa. And more people should live that. Embrace it, not avoid it. Like me. I have valued my travel experiences of being a culture where I am the wrong color, where I am left handed. Yet visiting is not quite the same as living there. At the same time I have realized it is not the same. It struck on a project this year in central Mexico, that while I was the wrong color, the wrong language, as a white American I still hold a position of advantage. The experience helps appreciate the difference, but I feel so far from really really understanding it. Leave a Comment Cancel reply All fields are required. Your email address will not be published.

By: IANS | New York | Published:August 13, 2016 12:20 pm Telepresence systems sold by companies like HP and Cisco may offer a virtual meeting space but the right equipment needs to be at both ends usually at a fixed location, noted Google. Heard of “virtual meetings”? With a new drone with a projector, this will soon be possible. US tech giant Google has been granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an “unmanned aerial vehicle for collaboration” called mobile telepresence system. The objective of a telepresence system is to present interactive video and audio between users in geographically-dispersed locations. “Many drones come with cameras but Google thinks a drone with a projector could be the answer to mobile telepresence conferencing,” technology website zdnet.com reported on Friday. Google thinks that its unmanned drone could provide significant improvements in speed, maneuverability, energy consumption and facilitate access to cramped spaces. For stability reasons, Google’s quadcopter design is shaped like the letter ‘H’ with a propeller at the ends of each of the longer strokes, the report said. In one embodiment, a screen dangles off the front end of the drone while a projector perches at the rear of the vehicle. The display area of the screen is being described as semi-translucent so that images projected from the rear can be viewed from the front-facing surface of the screen. “The smartphone may receive images from the user at the remote location, and may project the received images through a projector included with the smartphone,” the report added.

According to Google, it can solve this with the help of drones equipped with everything that a telepresence system features, including cameras, microphones, projectors, speakers and a display.

If the Silicon Valley tech giant’s recent appeal to a federal regulator is successful, Omaha would be a proving ground for what could be a less-expensive component of labor- and capital-intensive fiber service. In an Aug. 5 request to the Federal Communications Commission, Google asked for permission to use public airwaves in a series of “radio experiments” involving wireless transmitters that broadcast a high-speed Internet signal over radio waves. It requested access for a period of 24 months. That temporary, two-year window muddies whether Google would make a bid to establish itself here and compete with incumbents in the Omaha market, where Cox Communications and CenturyLink already are at work expanding existing fiber service. Google officials did not return messages on Friday. Brad Moline, president of Imperial, Nebraska-based ALLO Communications, said Friday that the telecommunications provider that serves western Nebraska communities including Ogallala, Scottsbluff and North Platte is preparing to launch new fiber service to customers in Lincoln “in the next few days.” But that infrastructure is buried underground and then routed directly to customers’ homes. The Google technology could eliminate that last step of connecting to a user’s home, thereby saving significant time and money, Moline said. “We would adapt (wireless) uses where appropriate,” Moline said of the experimental technology that Google wants to test in Omaha. A Google spokesman confirmed to the Business Insider website, which first reported on the FCC filing, that the tech giant was testing equipment on radio frequencies that were opened up to the public in April 2015. As Google senior policy counsel Staci Pies explained on Google’s public policy blog at that time: “Users of the (newly available) spectrum might, for instance, deploy ‘small cell’ networks that can carry heavy loads of data in high-traffic areas — such as crowded stadiums — or offer fixed wireless broadband services in rural areas.” The “small cells” are easy to deploy and don’t require huge infrastructure, like cellphone towers. The implications of that relative ease and ubiquitous broadband access go far beyond weekend Netflix binges and late-night gaming sessions. “In a community where high-growth companies are going to thrive, high-speed Internet is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” said David Arnold, managing director of Omaha startup accelerator Straight Shot. “It can be the difference between a company getting a project done on time or being able to deliver on a sale.” Omaha is one of 12 cities listed in the FCC application as locations slated for initial testing. Others include Mountain View and Palo Alto, California; San Francisco; Boulder, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; and Provo, Utah. Later testing would be conducted in 12 other cities including Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Des Moines. There’s no question that Omaha has an appetite for super-fast Internet: CenturyLink in May 2013 launched its first high-speed fiber network pilot here, and Rachel Woodman, market development manager for CenturyLink, said the company “continues to look for opportunities” to expand its fiber reach in Omaha. Cox spokeswoman Beth Weiss said the demand for high-speed connections is such that suppliers are having a hard time keeping Internet providers stocked with equipment. She also said the kind of next-generation technology that Google wants to test here could help Cox achieve its goal of delivering gigabit-speed Internet access to all of Omaha by the end of 2017.

As with every Olympics, there are so many events happening all the time that it’s difficult to keep a track of your favorites. Thankfully, technology has made this much easier than it used to be. This time, there are several apps to tell you everything you need to know, and even offer highlights when you want it. But there’s a lot of rubbish out there, like the official Olympics app that provides nothing of real value. So let’s cut through the clutter and find the actually useful apps and web sites. If you want to know when Usain Bolt is running his next race or if you’d like to find out how your country performed yesterday, these are the tools you need. Google Olympics (Web): Where to Watch, Today’s Schedule, and Everything Else Funnily, the best way to get information about any athlete, event, or country is to just Google the term “Olympics 2016”. The search engine giant has made the most of its Knowledge Graph technology An In-Depth Look At Google's New Knowledge Graph An In-Depth Look At Google's New Knowledge Graph Read More and built a mini-website for the Olympics, which works through Google.com itself. The graphic interface shows the important upcoming events, along with their timing localized to your current timezone. Tap the “On TV” tab to see your local sports channels’ Olympics airing schedule for the day. The “Athletes” tab shows the current trending athletes, and you can sort them further by country, sport, or gender. Head to the “Country” tab to see all the events in which a particular country’s athletes are scheduled to play. Along with a medals tally and full schedule, Google has done a bang-up job of giving answers to the most common questions that most users would have. At this point, you don’t need to go to any other site to look up basic information. RioCal (Android, iOS | $1.99): Calendar with Notifications for Athletes or Events If you aren’t really interested in the Olympics at large and just want to follow a few events or athletes, RioCal is the app you need. The download is free and you have a one hour trial, but after that, you’ll need to pony up two dollars. Download the app on your phone and you’ll see sports and athletes as the two main sections. Tap a sport, pick the event you’re interested in, and sync the calendar. You can also tap athletes to choose individual athletes to follow. However, you can’t follow an entire country in one tap, you’ll need to individually follow each athlete from that country. You can set RioCal to remind you about the event automatically, and for some reason, this is the only app to do it well right now. Two bucks so you don’t miss Usain Bolt breaking a new record? Worth it! Download: RioCal for Android ($1.99) | iOS ($1.99) A Redditor has also made and shared an importable Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar A calendar keeps every aspect of your life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more.

Speaking of Reddit, the official Olympics subreddit is the only place you’ll get to see GIFs of the best moments from this year’s Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially banned media from creating GIFs, so your only option to speak the Internet’s language GIFs, The Language Of The Web: Their History, Culture, and Future GIFs, The Language Of The Web: Their History, Culture, and Future Read More is user-submitted GIFs on Reddit. The r/Olympics subreddit is constantly being updated by people around the world. Unlike many news sites, it isn’t US-centric, so you’ll get global coverage of events and players. It also serves as a good way to use Reddit productively How To Use Reddit Productively. Yes, You Read That Correctly. How To Use Reddit Productively. Yes, You Read That Correctly.

Twitter (Web): The Best Moments for Your Country, and a Full Athletes’ List Social networking giant Twitter is pulling out all the stops to make it easy for you to follow the Olympics. In its quest, it has made the best way to check your country’s progress so far. The Twitter Moments tab will give you country-specific highlights for whichever region you are accessing the social network from. If you’re signed in with the official Twitter app, you can even follow sports or events. But remember, you can use Twitter without signing up for an account Yes, You Can Use Twitter Without an Account - Here's How Yes, You Can Use Twitter Without an Account - Here's How Twitter's open nature lets anyone check out the micro-blogging social network without requiring a registration.

Twitter has also created a Twitter list of all athletes at Rio, so you get to see what your favorite sports stars are up to. NBC Sports on YouTube (Web): The Best Place for Highlights The IOC is taking down unauthorized videos on YouTube and other places. Your best bet to watch highlights is an official partner, and on YouTube, the people doing the best job are the folks at the NBC Sports YouTube channel. NBC Sports has an Olympics playlist, updated regularly, in case you don’t want to see clips of any other sports outside the 2016 Games. The reliability of the clip, the English commentary, and the high quality of the video make this one a winner when compared to any unofficial source. Of course, the NBC Sports YouTube channel is only available for viewers in the US, but you can easily bypass regional restrictions on YouTube How to Easily Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter How to Easily Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter Some YouTube videos are restricted by location. Luckily, with a few tricks you can unblock YouTube videos not available in your country to what any content you want to, regardless of your location. Read More to watch any clip. I recommend using the BetterNet extension. For country-specific highlights, you might want to see if your local official broadcaster is uploading their highlights packages on the web. You can find your local provider through the Google Knowledge Graph. What’s Got You Excited in the Olympics? The 2016 Olympics might be the last time we get to see the world’s fastest man run on a track. Usain Bolt is the highlight of this year’s games, while Michael Phelps is back again to get more gold medals than anyone in history. I can’t wait to see them in action!

Wednesday 23 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 21:08 / GMT - 17:38 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Aug 12, 2016 2:6 Google Chrome Will Start Blocking All Flash Content next Month Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The next phase in Adobe Flash’s agonizingly slow demise starts next month when Google Chrome begins blocking all Flash content. Flash was an integral part of the internet in years past, but it has also been a drag on performance and the source of a great many security vulnerabilities. Today, HTML5 is a better way to get the same sort of interactive content running on the web, and it works on mobile devices. The next phase in Adobe Flash’s agonizingly slow demise starts next month when Google Chrome begins blocking all Flash content. This will come as part of the Chrome 53 update, which should be available in early September. Chrome 53 will block all the small, non-visible Flash elements on web pages. These are usually tacking platforms and page analytics, but they can slow down page loads just like larger Flash content. This is not Google’s first attempt to de-emphasize Flash on the web. Last year in Chrome 52, Google made most Flash content “click-to-play.” So, what’s different now? In Chrome 52, the Flash block only applied to Flash objects that were above a certain size, but now that’s being extended to smaller Flash objects. The previous restriction was in place because at the time, there was no reliable way to detect viewability. Now, Chrome’s intersection observer API allows that. You will have the option to enable Flash objects on a page if they are necessary for the experience. If non-visible Flash objects are blocked, an icon in the address bar will alert you. Google says that all Chrome users will see a benefit from this move. All the Flash objects loading in the background can make page loading sluggish. If you’re on a laptop, Flash also gobbles up power and reduces your battery life. Flash’s innate inefficiency is why it never took off on mobile devices. While Flash content will be blocked in general, Google is making a temporary exception for some popular sites that still rely heavily upon Flash. Those include Facebook, Twitch, and Yahoo, among others. You’ll be prompted to enable Flash on these sites when loading them, but Google plans to phase out the Flash whitelist over time. When Chrome 55 rolls out in December, HTML5 will become the default experience. It’s not clear how exactly that will affect the whitelist. The writing is on the wall for Flash; it’s not just Google waging a war on the archaic plug-in. Firefox 48 was announced last week with some Flash content being click-to-play and all Flash being blocked by default in 2017. Even Microsoft is cutting Flash off at the knees. In the Windows 10 anniversary update, Edge uses click-to-play for non-essential Flash elements. Another year or two and we’ll be all done with this.         LATEST STORIES (78) Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights Iran Calls for Collective Efforts to Fight Terrorism UNHCR Official: Iran's Supports for Refugees "Unmatched" US Gives Green Light to Airbus on Sale of over 100 Passenger Planes to Iran Rouhani Felicitates Lebanon on Independence Day Iran, UNIDO Ink Country Program Framework Syrian Commander: Popular Uprising against Terrorists Starts in Eastern Aleppo Battle for Mosul Day 37: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Completes Siege of Tal Afar Israel 'Revives' Eastern Jerusalem Settler Homes Plan Hashd Al-Shaabi Wins Back Several More Villages Near Mosul Libyan Forces Press Forward Against ISIL in Sirte Iranian Speaker: Establishment of Democracy Impossible by Supporting Terrorism in Syria Envoy: Damascus against Proposals to Create Autonomous Areas in Syria Moscow: UN Envoy 'Sabotaging' Syria Resolution ISIL Terrorists Execute 15 Iraqi soldiers in Mosul Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian and Indonesian officials in a meeting in Tehran on Wednesday underlined the need for the further expansion of mutual cooperation in human rights fields.

Diagnose, Minimize & Reverse the Damage Google Algorithms Explained, Pt. 2: Provide Better Answers So you’ve decided to expand your brand overseas? Congratulations! Opening up your website to an audience beyond one country is a significant opportunity to growing your business. Of course, once you’ve started the process of expanding internationally, you’ll be faced with some very important decisions. For your online business, one of the most important choices at the very beginning of this process is how to build your site to ensure you’re reaching your new target audiences. In this piece we’ll go over all of the different options available to you for your international site structure. We’ll also investigate the potential impacts on SEO and provide other technical considerations for international SEO. Building Multilingual or Multi-Regional Websites When coming up with your international site structure, there are a few different paths you can take: Subdomains: uk.example.com Subdirectories: example.com/uk Country code top-level domains (ccTLD): example.co.uk. Note: Google interprets any top-level domain (TLD) that isn’t a registered country code as a generic TLD (gTLD). Each option comes with its pros and cons and the right option varies on a case-by-case basis. Country Code Top Level Domains Using a ccTLD is perhaps the strongest signal you can send to search engines that your site is intended for users from a specific country. For example, seeing yoursite.fr or yoursite.jp will tell them that they should serve those sites in search results in France or Japan, respectively. The biggest advantage of taking this route is that Google has come out and said it uses ccTLDs to determine target audiences. ccTLDs are good for businesses that: Have a well-established global brand and will be creating a lot of content. Are large operations with a physical presence in multiple locations. Have the resources to build, maintain and promote a unique site for each targeted country. Have a variety of products or services available depending on location and/or country. Want to host their international versions on servers not located in the targeted countries. Users also have a higher level of trust and familiarity with their country’s ccTLD (an important factor for an eCommerce business), which leads to a better user experience. However, using this method also has the following drawbacks: Significant development resources are required to create and maintain the various websites. You’ll need to create and implement a unique SEO strategy for each site — you don’t get to take advantage of any acquired link juice or domain authority. This means separate keyword research, content strategies and link building for each. Someone could have already registered your domain using a ccTLD you wish to target, or your ability to use certain ccTLDs could be restricted. Subdomains Creating multilingual or multi-regional subdomains is a possible solution for companies that haven’t built up strong global brand awareness and won’t be creating a lot of content to fill multiple sites using ccTLDs. Go this route if you: Don’t have a lot of resources to spend on building and maintaining multiple sites using ccTLDs. Don’t have the time or resources to invest in building and maintaining multilingual or regional link profiles. Have content that doesn’t differ by much other than slight language or regional tweaks. Have product and/or service catalogs that aren’t significantly different based on language or location. Want to keep your different regional/language targeted sites on separate servers. If you do end up going this route, use Google Search Console to geotarget each subdomain. You can do this as well if you use ccTLDs, but search engines already see those country codes as signals to target specific regions. Of course, nothing is perfect. Subdomains also have their limitations: They still require investing IT time and resources into setting up and maintaining multiple subdomains. While Googlers like Matt Cutts and John Mueller have made statements about Google’s ability to pass authority between subdomains, the truth is that they still aren’t really able to do so on a reliable basis. So the value and link juice you’ve built up for one subdomain won’t really do much to help the others. If you’ve got a bunch of subdomains for different languages or regions, you’ll seriously dilute what authority you are able to share between them. Subdirectories Also knows as subfolders, subdirectories allow you to host all your language versions on one generic domain (gTLD), with content stored in a separate folder for each language or country. You can actually create folders for each language and country, for example: example.com/en-us/ and example.com/en-gb/. Since they are all on the same site, subfolders are easy and require little investment to set up and maintain. And because all the folders are on the original domain, you get to take advantage of any link juice and authority you’ve already acquired. You’ll also get to share any of the benefits realized from future SEO campaigns as well. Since subdirectories can be somewhat ambiguous when it comes to determining language vs. region targeting (is /fr/ targeting the French language or France?), use Google Search Console to geo-target each subfolder. Just click Add a Property and enter your URL with the language subdirectory included (www.example.com/en/, for example). After you’ve verified your ownership of your property, you can set regional targeting as shown earlier. Subdirectories are good for you if: You don’t have the time or resources to set up ccTLDs or subdomains for every language and region you’re targeting. Your current site has lots of value and backlinks built up. Your foreign language versions won’t have many differences in site structure, navigation and content. Your products and services don’t vary much between languages and/or regions. You don’t have a physical location in the countries you’re targeting. There are some disadvantages to using subfolders for international SEO. The URL structure could be ambiguous for some users: Visitors to example.com/de/ could end up wondering if they’re looking at a page that’s targeted to the country Germany or just the language. Example.de is explicitly for the country of Germany. Subdirectories are a much weaker signal to search engines than ccTLDs. If you have geo-targeted websites in the same language, you run the risk of the wrong version ranking. Your whole site is hosted on the same server, which could mean slower load times. This isn’t much of an issue these days, fortunately. Note: If you choose to use either subdomains or subdirectories, you have to use the correct lingo: search engines will understand “Deutsch” or “de.” They won’t understand if you use non-native words like “Germany” or “German” in your subdomains or file path. There’s technically a fourth option you could use in lieu of those already mentioned: URL parameters. It’s possible to set up your site using URL parameters to determine region and/or language. However, this offers no benefits over the other options and only has drawbacks: Geotargeting in Google Search Console using URL parameters is impossible. Segmenting visitors based on URL parameters is difficult. Using URL parameters in general is not good for your SEO. On Page Considerations for International SEO Regional Landing Page Markup Once you’ve decided on the site structure that works best for you, it’s time to build your pages for regional targeting. Even though you’ve used your URLs to specify language and/or region and geotargeted your subdirectories or subdomains, you should still give your search engines an additional hint. Do this using the hreflang markup. You can learn more about using hreflang to prevent duplicate content in your international SEO here. But first, a quick refresher: Hreflang is added to the header of an HTML page and gives crawlers another hint that the page should be served to users in a certain location or who speak a particular language or both. The hreflang tag should look like this when properly used: <link rel="alternate" hreflang=”en” href=”https://www.example.com”>
 If you’ve got multiple versions of a non-HTML page, such as a PDF document, put the hreflang in the HTTP header as so: link: <https://www.example.com/>; rel="alternate"; hreflang=”en”
 For hreflang to work properly you need to include a link to every version of a page. So if you’ve got pages in English, German and Russian, include all three:  <link rel="alternate" hreflang=”en” href=”https://www.example.com”>

 <link rel="alternate" hreflang=”de” href=”https://www.example.com”>

 <link rel="alternate" hreflang=”ru” href=”https://www.example.com”>
 Use the hreflang variable to geotarget by including country codes: <link rel="alternate" hreflang=”en-us” href=”https://www.example.com”>
 Set your language using the ISO 639-1 standard and use the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 format for countries. Note that you can only geotarget by country using hreflang — it doesn’t support regions like Asia or North Africa. Setting a Generic International Landing Page Something we didn’t go over when discussing hreflang before is how to use hreflang to set a default landing page for users that aren’t included in the hreflang tags you’ve used. Do this with the x-default hreflang value. Properly implemented it looks like: <link rel="alternate” href=”https://www.example.com/” hreflang=”x-default” /> Let’s say you’ve got a website that targets English speakers in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Your hreflang tags should look like: <link rel="alternate” href=”https://www.example.com/ca” hreflang=”en-ca” />

<link rel="alternate” href=”https://www.example.com/au” hreflang=”en-au” />

<link rel="alternate” href=”https://www.example.com/” hreflang=”x-default” />
 In this case, a French speaker from Canada and an English speaker from the United States would both be served https://www.example.com/ as a landing page. This attribute is useful for sites that only want to target a few specific languages and/or countries, detect the user’s geolocation in the Accept-Language header, or ask users to select their language or country. Meta Elements It’s a good idea to tailor your on page meta elements to your target language and location. That includes your title tags, meta descriptions, headers and image alt text. With the exception of the descriptions, these elements all provide strong signals about the page’s subject to search engines, and are relied on heavily to determine relevance to a search keyword. Adapting them to native phrases will help give search engines another push in the right direction regarding your page. Pay special attention to the language meta tag. Bing doesn’t allow geotargeting but it does look at this tag. Make sure it’s implemented correctly across all pages. It should look like this: <meta http-equiv="content-language” content=”en-us”>
 In Conclusion There’s a lot to consider whenever you’re launching a new site or otherwise expanding your business online. When it comes to your SEO, making sure you’re getting the right content in front of your targeted international audience should be one of your top considerations. That starts with using the way you’ve built your global site to tell search engines who should be served which site. It’s not always clear-cut, but finding the right site structure and on page technical elements can set you on the path to ranking highly in your global target markets. Have you launched any international sites? What site structure did you use? What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome them?

Chrome OS, Android, Chromecasts, you name it. Linux has powered Google hardware for years. However, the Linux kernel is not ideal for every situation. Especially in the case of embedded devices like car dashboards or GPS units, full-blown desktop kernels like Linux impact performance and cause other issues. There’s a massive ecosystem of operating systems designed for embedded hardware, and Google may be working on their own.

Both devices are reportedly being made by HTC, with both smartphones sharing the "same basic industrial design and materials," reports Android Police. The site also notes that both devices have "identical specifications aside from screen size, resolution, and battery capacity".   The Nexus S1 should have a 5-inch screen while the Nexus M1 features a 5.5-inch display - they will be identical when it comes to design and materials. The leaked photo above is the Sailfish smartphone, which looks like it has a metallic design and a fingerprint scanner on the back with a camera module made of glass, and not plastic.   There's no Nexus branding on it, instead, Android Police reports they expect that "by the time handsets enter production, the "G" will be present". We will hear more about the new Nexus smartphones in the coming weeks.   Recommended for You Google and Verizon spend $30 million a week on Pixel...

Seriously. Google it. It was a career high (and possibly a cultural low). Do we trust robots and technology too much? Not enough? Have people not seen I, Robot? I mean the 2004, Will Smith-led cautionary tale about robots, of course, and not the fine company that makes the robot vacuums we use in all of our hilarious pet videos. Automation: It’s led to a 1,000-percent increase in sober people going to Taco Bell. Automation isn’t a bad thing; we’re not going to be attacked by vacuums, after all, and there are plenty of conveniences it supplies. I don’t have to wait in line at Starbucks any more, for example. I can order from my phone. And that’s true at most places now. It’s probably led to a 1,000-percent increase in sober people going to Taco Bell. Our phones do almost everything now. You can scan a check and it’s magically in your bank account. You do have to get the lighting just right so the app will scan, however, so we’ve all become amateur photographers, turning on and off lights in our house, to achieve the optimum setting for a check photo. But in general, automation is awesome. Consider the following. We don’t have to interact with strangers as much If there’s a payment option that doesn’t involve interacting with real people, I choose that. It’s just easier. Bank tellers bribe people with free lollipops and it still doesn’t work. For a time, the only thing I still had to pay in person was rent. But now that’s done, too. Yapstone’s RentPayment allows you to pay your apartment rent online or with an app. Because let’s be honest, the odds of me actually writing a check are not good. You can even pay your rent with a credit card if you don’t have the money in your bank account. That would have come in handy when I had to make rent back in college. Those years felt like an audition for Top Ramen Chef, which needs to be a show. We’re learning to like drones Drones can do more than spy on people in their underwear. Flirtey made the very first FAA-approved commercial drone delivery in the United States on July 17, 2015. Flirtey collaborated with NASA Langley Research Center to deliver medical supplies to a rural Virginia town in order to support a free health clinic that served about 1,500 patients. The types of medical supplies delivered by Flirtey are often in great demand for underserved communities and during natural disasters. That same drone has landed itself in the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum alongside the likes of the Space Shuttle Discovery, and the SR-71 Blackbird. We don’t have to go to concerts anymore Lately, I’ve been playing around more and more with VR and all the non-video game uses that do or may exist for the new platform. Cody Ross founded Slingshot VR, a new virtual reality technology he’s developing at Gerard Adams’ new incubator, Fownders. With it, fans can attend their favorite concert without actually being there. That’s great if you are too far away to attend or really don’t enjoy traffic. I tried it and actually felt like I was in the middle of a crowd at a Chance the Rapper concert — it was pretty insane. Drones can do more than spy on people in their underwear. But are we reaching a tipping point where we start to trust computers and robots more than humans? What if we become people who never leave the house, have sex with robots, and interact only through VR? It would make for a very boring Snapchat account. The NFL is entertaining the idea of having people view games through VR from specific seats. It’s not impossible that there could come a day when the only people in the stadium are the players. The people who hold the down markers would obviously be replaced by robots. And the sideline reporters would be replaced with Facebook Live cameras. I already love tech more than my family I love technology more than 93 percent of my family members, but there are always unintended consequences. And technology is impacting every single part of our life. Please enable Javascript to watch this video One of the biggest shifts we’ll see may be in financial planning and investments, not an industry synonymous with tech and innovation. Ben VerWys, a financial expert recently featured in Inc., works in an industry that until two years ago was dominated by face-to-face meetings in a Regus office or at a TGI AppleChilis. VerWys took a different approach, creating a highly successful investment hybrid that combines apps, automation, and a little human contact. As he explains, there are benefits to having an algorithm doing your investing for you — but you still need a person to help guide you through tough decisions. “The good is that you know what you’re getting. What you get is investing made easy in the sense of the behaviors and investments themselves. They are naturally going to be lower cost, re-balance, and it’s going to give you a decent investment approach while life is made easy,” VerWys told me. Sideline reporters will obviously be replaced with Facebook Live cameras. But there are times when technology fails us. And it can be a lot more serious than when a Hot Pocket is cold on the inside or Xfinity inexplicably only has half of Mr. Robot on demand. When it comes to automated investing, VerWys said, “the downside is it’s hands-off. Just because it’s easy and decent doesn’t mean it’s good. It’s flawed when you need help. Like when the market is crashing and you don’t know what to do and there are emotion involved. It won’t protect you from bad decision making. It won’t stop you from exiting the market at the wrong time.” “Investors need some measure of protection against themselves,” he noted. And the same could be said for all of us. Robots, drones, and apps that can do anything and be anything aren’t bad, by nature alone. I embrace every innovation. But like Ferris Bueller, sometimes you have to stop and look around once in a while — or a robot will steal your girlfriend.

Obituary Learning disabilities By Contributing Author | Posted on Aug 15 2016 Tag: Child Study Team, Greg Borja, NMPASI, Special Education My daughter has a learning disability. As defined by Google, a learning disability is a condition giving rise to difficulties in acquiring knowledge and skills to the level expected of those of the same age, especially when not associated with a physical limitation. During her first 3 years of school, learning the basics (i.e., Math and Reading) was a struggle. It was not only hard on her, but hard on me as a parent as well. I wasn’t sure of what to do, what to expect, or how to handle each situation. This summer, I started my internship with the Northern Marianas Protection Advocacy Inc. I got to work with a former teacher of mine, who is now my co-worker Mr. Greg Borja. Through his assistance, I learned about the Special Education program, a Child Study Team, and my daughter was able to get the necessary assistance to develop the skills she needed help on in school, through an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Last year she was a student at GTC Elementary, and she is looking forward to another school year this time at San Vicente Elementary School when summer is over. Thank you Mr. Greg for educating me more on the services my daughter could avail of in school and thank you to NMPASI for everything that you have done in making sure my daughter gets the appropriate education services she is eligible for. For more information about learning disabilities or the IEP process, please contact NMPASI at 235-7273/4 or visit us online at www.nmpasi.org.

The ship was run aground and converted into a store. The notion of such long-forgotten wrecks prompted Hanke six years ago to use the name Niantic to christen a quest to combine gaming, mobile mapping and augmented reality to playfully reveal virtual things hidden in the real world. Niantic was a side-project for Hanke at Google, which had bought the entrepreneur's startup Keyhole in 2004 and turned it into the free mapping service Google Earth. Hanke spent years as a top executive in a Google “geo” division producing widely used services such as Maps and Street View. The gamer wanted to go beyond helping people navigate and have fun with the ability for mobile devices to detect people's locations. The entrepreneur toyed with the idea of launching a new startup, but instead kept Niantic anchored in the Silicon Valley technology powerhouse. “Staying at Google gave us the advantage of being able to tap into the data we have at (mapping division) Geo and the infrastructure of Google,” Hanke was quoted as saying in a 2012 Inc. magazine article. Portals to Pokemon The Niantic project fielded its first offering in 2011 in the form of a mobile application called Fieldtrip that served up information about where smartphone users were or nearby places of interest. The following year, Niantic launched a game called “Ingress,” seen as a predecessor to “Pokemon Go.” Ingress, which has been downloaded more than 15 million times, also uses real world surroundings as the game board. Instead of trying to catch cartoon monsters such as iconic Pikachu by targeting them with “Pokeballs,” Ingress players battle for control of virtual portals. Early Ingress fans submitted pictures of places as possible portals complete with satellite position metadata, essentially crowdsourcing a rich geo-location database that was put to use in “Pokemon Go.” When Google underwent a corporate restructuring last year to divvy its endeavors into arms of a freshly created parent company called Alphabet, Niantic went independent. Google did invest in Niantic, as did Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Niantic claims from 50 to 100 employees. The private company does not make its financial information public but some analysts value it at more that US$3 billion. To justify such a valuation, Niantic will have to prove that “Pokemon Go” is a lasting and profitable, not just another passing fling for notriously fickle mobile game players. “Pokemon Go” has shown it can make money. Industry tracker Sensor Tower estimated that “Pokemon Go” generated more than US$200 million in revenue during the month after its release in early July. The game is free, but players can buy virtual supplies such as PokeBalls and lures to attract Pokemon. Cafes, pubs, restaurants and other venues have taken to buying lures that tempt players to linger, and hopefully spend money, while waiting to catch Pokemon. Sponsors During a recent Venture Beat technology conference, Hanke said that the game was designed from the outset for in-app purchases, and that revenue could also be made from sponsorships along the lines of what was done in Ingress. Ingress has portals hosted in commercial spots such as shopping centers, and “Pokemon Go” launched in Japan with fast food giant McDonald's sponsoring in-game locations. “We are talking to a bunch of other businesses that want to take advantage of that model for “Pokemon Go” in other parts of the world,” Hanke said at the conference. “It's promising.” A strong selling point for “Pokemon Go” sponsorships is that they get people swarming to places in a way that typical advertising does not. The power of “Pokemon Go” has, to some, become a bane. Parks and other public venues ripe with PokeStops or “gyms” where cartoon creatures battle are at times overrun with players. Authorities have taken to warning “Pokemon Go” players against venturing where it is dangerous, illegal, in poor taste, or they are simply not wanted. The game and its creator are already in the sites of lawyers intent on suing to hold them accountable for trespassing or injuries involving players. The Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center has called for U.S. regulators to investigate whether Niantic is collecting too much information about players and their whereabouts.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Amazon's Alexa spreading beyond living rooms Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Nick WingfieldThe New York Times SEATTLE — Amazon surprised a lot of people when its Echo, a $180 so-called smart speaker, became a hit, giving them a novel way to play music, turn on the lights in their homes and set thermostats with voice commands. Amazon, though, has much bigger plans for the technology behind Echo. It wants the Alexa Voice Service, which powers Echo, to be an ingredient in devices around the home and beyond, even if they aren’t made by Amazon. The vision of an omnipresent intelligent assistant is one Amazon shares, in one form or another, with most other big technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft. Along with a handful of startups, these companies see their intelligent assistants as powerful new ways for users to interact with devices and internet services — just as smartphone touch screens were. A unified interface Many technology specialists think that people will be OK with a single intelligent assistant in their lives but that most won’t have the patience to regularly use two or three of them, each with its individual quirks. As a result, each company is racing to weave its assistant into as many devices and services as possible. Amazon, for example, wants Alexa to be a part of products like Nucleus, a smart-intercom system with a touch screen and a camera that went on sale last week for $249 (or $199 each if you buy two or three at once). Nucleus owners can have Alexa play music and read a weather forecast through the device. In a phone interview, Jonathan Frankel, the chief executive of Nucleus, said that adding Alexa to Nucleus was a no-brainer because it made the device far more useful. “We’re taking $180 worth of utility and adding it into a $200 device,” he said. So far, a handful of smaller companies have released or promised to release products with Alexa built into them. There’s Triby, a portable speaker; CoWatch, a smartwatch; and Pebble Core, a wireless wearable device by the maker of the Pebble smartwatch. Ford Motor Co. is working with Amazon to integrate Alexa into its vehicles so drivers can control smart-home features like lights, thermostats and security systems from their cars. Over 10,000 developers have registered to integrate Alexa into their products, Amazon said. It won’t say how many Echo units it has sold, except to say that millions of devices with Alexa in them have been purchased. John MacFarlane, the chief executive of Sonos, another well-known device maker, hinted in a blog post this year that Sonos was working on a way to play music through its speakers using Alexa voice control. In an interview this spring, David Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, said that the company wanted there to be as many Alexa-linked “endpoints” around the home as possible and that Amazon did not really care who made those devices. Amazon has expanded its lineup of devices that use Alexa with its Echo Dot, a miniature version of the Echo speaker, and Amazon Tap, a portable Bluetooth speaker. “The longer-term vision is a little bit like the ‘Star Trek’ computer,” Limp said. “Capt. Kirk or Picard could sit on the bridge and ask anything and get the right answer.” The moving hurdle But while Amazon has made a lot of progress in this regard, it may have a hard time extending Alexa’s reach outside the home because of its weaknesses in mobile technology, analysts say. The success of Echo has been described as a redemption of sorts for Amazon after it suffered a brutal defeat in the smartphone market with its Fire Phone, which the company stopped selling after poor sales — a misstep that has left Amazon vulnerable. Apple and Google have clear advantages over Amazon because of their dominant positions in the mobile market. And they are pushing their versions of Alexa — Siri and Google’s assistant — as ways to control other devices throughout the home. Apple has a technology called HomeKit that allows people to control thermostats, light switches and other devices with Siri from Apple devices. Google has announced plans for an Echo-like home speaker called Google Home. As intelligent assistants improve in quality, Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, thinks people will want these virtual helpers to follow them all day like a companion. “What you want from an assistant is that they are always available to you everywhere.” While Amazon could eventually give people access to Alexa’s functions through apps on smartphones (a couple of apps from independent developers do this already), Dawson is skeptical Amazon will be able to make them work as well as assistants more deeply integrated into smartphones by Apple and Google. “They’re basically absent on smartphones, which are devices we take everywhere we go,” he said.

Fox Business1:49 UP NEXT Five years ago, when the U.S. auto industry was just beginning to recover from the Great Recession, there was widespread speculation that the old model of the car business was broken, and that only the new economy could come to the rescue.  Quotes in the article General Motors Co GM ▲ 33.91 +0.10 +0.30% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.87 -0.93 -0.83% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.41 -0.72 -1.17% And with good reason. The U.S. auto market had cratered, plunging from a peak of over 17 million to a devastated 10 million in yearly sales. Both General Motors and Chrysler had been bailed out by the federal government and gone bankrupt. Ford saw its stock price fall to less than $2 a share. Gas had spiked to over $4 a gallon in some parts of country. Credit, the lifeblood of the car business, had been wiped out. Meanwhile, Apple was on a path to become the world's most valuable company. Facebook was tasking over the media landscape. And Tesla, after suffering a brush with financial death in 2009, looked like the most innovative company of four wheels. Silicon Valley and California in general was suddenly filled with new and futuristic ideas about transportation, from Google driverless cars to numerous electric-car startups. Detroit, by contrast, was lurching toward the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history (it would come in 2013), and its great automakers looked to be crippled dinosaurs, completely out of step with the times. The U.S. auto industry was a problem to be solved, and Silicon Valley specialized in solutions. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Mary Barra Chevrolet Trax Reveal NYC A doomed industry? "The automobile industry is in the middle of a fundamental transformation," wrote in 2009. "There is a lot of information available on how companies have dealt with major changes in their business environments, but little is known about the transformation of entire industries." "History shows that most companies do not deal well with transformation." he continued. "One reason has to do with senior managers. They usually 'don't get it.' They have a difficult time accepting that the future will be vastly different from the present because they rose to power in the old business environment. They excelled in the old environment and didn't acquire skills necessary to operate in the new." Fast forward to 2016 and the senior mangers in Detroit that Grove worried about have deepened their engagement with Silicon Valley and the technology industry to an unprecedented degree. General Motors already had a venture-capital arm before it invested $500 million in Lyft and bought Cruise Automation for its innovative self-driving tech.© Provided by Business Insider Inc Cruise Automation Ford had such a solid connection with Microsoft that outgoing CEO Alan Mulally was discussed as a successor to Steve Ballmer; the earlier this year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has teamed up with Google to create driverless minivans. And all the automakers have a Silicon Valley presence, which enables them to scout emerging technologies and act on them quickly. An auto sales boom in the U.S. that started in 2013 and set a record in 2016 with 17.5 million new cars and trucks delivered has fueled Detroit's engagement, as has the broad realization among the car maker's executive teams that this is their opportunity to disrupt themselves and profit from the experience. Cheap gas, an improving employment picture, and ample credit means that Detroit is selling pickups and SUVs and raking in cash. The game plan is to take some of those winnings and send them in search of rapid innovations that Motown can't create on its own. Not-so-smooth sailing At the same time, Silicon Valley has started to encounter some investor turbulence. Startups with hefty valuations don't see IPOs as a way to pay back their investors. That leaves getting acquired as an option, but a level of saturation with social networking and apps might have set in.  The Detroit automakers aren't in the market for messaging apps, but they are looking for technologies that can future-proof them, or advance the process of making cars smarter. In conversations with people in the auto industry, there's a sense that the tech sector has begun to figure out that Motown has money and wants to spend it. The signals from the top are also strong. "We’re going to disrupt ourselves, and we are disrupting ourselves, so we’re not trying to preserve a model of yesterday," . "And when you think of the assets the company has — the scale, the control of the vehicle platform, the ability with embedded connectivity, the knowledge we have of just every aspect of the vehicle and how we’re putting it together now — I think there’s a lot of plus signs, and we can lead." That attitude was echoed by Ford CEO Mark Fields, who BI also interviewed. "It's a very exciting time at Ford, because we are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and a mobility company," he said. "Mobility for us, at the very simplest level, is to allow people to live, play, and work where they want. How do we help enable them to get around to do that? And there's a lot of talk around technology companies disrupting the auto industry. Our approach is very simple: We're disrupting ourselves."© Provided by Business Insider Inc Mark Fields Birds of a feather So how did this reversal come about? Even if Detroit isn't really in a position to rescue Silicon Valley — Silicon valley doesn't really need to be rescued — then why is the dinosaur now so enthusiastic about participating in its own disruption? Simple: Detroit was the Silicon Valley of the early 20th century, a hotbed of entrepreneurship, fascinated with the most high-tech contraption of the time — the automobile. True, over the decades the culture of the auto industry has become stratified and bureaucratic, but despite that, the car itself has been steadily improved. Detroit has never backed off from technology, and the engineers and executives who have chosen to work for Ford or GM are still excited about new stuff. When they look at Silicon Valley, they see a place ruled by engineers, a contemporary version of Detroit's own origin story.  And that's why Silicon Valley and Detroit's newfound mutual admiration could be the beginning of a long and beautiful friendship that stretches from the Bay Area to the banks of the Detroit River.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Tech Insider Pound's long-term future looks grim Tech Insider American kids are clamoring for this fascinating hatching toy that is sold out everywhere — and prices are skyrocketing Tech Insider 50 movies that critics really hate but normal people love Tech Insider Trump takes credit for a Ford factory staying in the US — but it was never leaving Tech Insider Tech Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Liverpool showed just what they’re capable of in a breathtaking spell after half-time, with Philippe Coutinho front and centre. Arsenal fans’ rancour will have been partially salved by their late fightback – and there’s no need to panic yet. They were the better side until Coutinho’s brilliant equaliser – and maybe Wenger will be persuaded to hold his nose and dive back into the transfer market. This was a game that was great value right from the start, with brilliance and blundering in equal measure throughout. It’s what the Premier League is all about. Thanks for joining me. Bye!

The Netflix chief executive may not have achieved the same kind of global dominance as Page’s Google, but there’s evidence he’s having an impact on productivity levels, at least in the UK. The day before we meet, regulator Ofcom revealed that 23% of people in the UK said they had watched Netflix in the previous week, up from 13% a year and a half earlier. “That’s a start, but that’s 77% not using it,” says Hastings. “So we’ve a long way to go to reach the ubiquity that’s important for a cultural phenomenon. We are making good progress.” However, Netflix has already become a cultural phenomenon, not least through both popularising the binge watch and creating a new euphemism, “Netflix and chill”. It is also dominating water-cooler conversations about TV. The summer’s word-of-mouth hit has been 80s nostalgia-heavy supernatural thriller Stranger Things, and there was a buzz too about last week’s launch of Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop history The Get Down. Stranger Things: Netflix boss says it would be 'dumb' not to do season two Read more Not that we know how many people actually watch the shows, because Netflix won’t tell anyone. In contrast to most traditional TV channels, the information doesn’t need to be given to advertisers (because Netflix doesn’t have any) and, in any case, the raw numbers are less important than the number of subscribers each show brings in. “It’s competitive information. It tells HBO what kind of shows to produce,” says Hastings. “Because we don’t have advertising chopping up the content, we are under a whole different model where we get the freedom to not compare all the shows and rank all the shows. Because it kind of doesn’t matter what everyone else loves the most, it matters what you or I love the most.” However many people are watching, chatter around Netflix will only get more intense in the UK later this year when it premieres The Crown, a multi-part biopic of Elizabeth II originated in Britain and costing a reported £100m to make. While it’s one of the more expensive shows commissioned by Netflix, the budget is just part of a $6bn (£4.6bn) pot of money the company plans to spend this year on content. That plan has got some in the industry worried. Just a year ago, John Landgraf, chief executive of Fox-owned US network FX, said there was “too much TV” and there is talk of a dangerous bubble in spending on quality drama, with much of the blame laid at Netflix’s door. Hastings is unrepentant. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Netflix’s Reed Hastings: ‘The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying one quarter.’ Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian “He thinks there is too much, he can do something about it,” says Hastings of Landgraf’s comment. “He can produce less, but we are going to produce more.” Could it become unsustainable for traditional media companies to up what they pay for content under pressure from new entrants? “I’m not sure for them, they might have to cut back, but we are going to grow. It’s sustainable because the new content helps us grow ... I’m not sure about in their model, if they are complaining about it they can fix their side, our side is working fine.” Netflix is not the only new player in town pushing up prices, and when it came to the show being made by the former Top Gear trio Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond the company was outbid by someone with far, far deeper pockets, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. A Netflix executive last year said Amazon had spent too much, before backtracking rapidly. Is Hastings worried about losing out? “We bid on Jeremy Clarkson’s show and they bid more,” says Hastings. “By the time they won it, we were like ‘Wow, that’s a lot of money.’ Maybe it’ll work for them, it might well. It could be a great show. You can’t tell until you’ve seen it. We lost on that one, there’s other ones we won. They are in the bidding, but so is Hulu in the US, so is HBO, we were bidding [against] Channel 4 for Black Mirror.” “Our spending the $5bn or $6bn is a fraction of the total industry spend. If Amazon spend a couple of billion it’s in a pool that is very large when you add up all the different networks and what they are spending on scripted entertainment around the world. I use Amazon all the time – I am a Prime user, when they have a good show I’ll watch that – but my sense is that they are just one more competitor amongst many.” That Hastings jokes with Page and competes with Bezos is not entirely surprising. Though Netflix started out as a mail order rental service, he is very much a techie. He founded software company Pure in the 90s and sits on Facebook’s board. He is also part of the Giving Pledge campaign championed by Microsoft’s founder Bill Gates and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, which commits some of the world’s richest people to donate most of their wealth to good causes during their lifetime (education is Hastings’ chosen cause). And at Netflix it is not Hastings but Ted Sarandos, the company’s chief content officer with what Hastings calls a “golden gut”, who makes the calls on which shows to buy, even if he is guided by algorithms and the occasional bit of data insight from his CEO. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stranger Things: the Winona Ryder thriller has been one of the hits of the summer in the US. Photograph: /Photoshot/Photoshot Another thing Hastings shares with his tech peers is his belief in constant growth. His content costs from both original commissions and the many billions in commitments to licences for older shows will be familiar to any long-serving LA TV exec, but his faith that as long as his subscriber numbers keep growing he’ll be able to keep spending is straight out of Silicon Valley. It’s not an unreasonable strategy, but recent numbers have disappointed. In its second quarter Netflix added just 160,000 memberships in the US and 1.52m internationally – compared with a forecast of 500,000 extra US members and 2m internationally – taking it to a total of 83 million members worldwide. The markets were unimpressed and the company’s share price dived. “It’s been volatile since we started,” he says of the share price. “The initial thing is we went public on the dollar, within six months we were down to 50c. We are trading about where we were before earnings. Everyone realises that internet video is the future. I don’t think [the markets] are worried, but there was disappointment about us having less growth than we expected. That’s definitely true, but it’s just one quarter. The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying over one quarter.” While growth in the US is slowing, its international expansion is doing well, and though it may not have many subscribers in Syria or North Korea, it claims to be in all but one market globally. But that market is the world’s largest, China, where it has faced the same political barriers as other western media and technology companies. “The Chinese government just closed down the Disney movie service. And they closed down Apple’s movie service. Those are two pretty sophisticated, relative to China, companies. It looks like the government just doesn’t want the foreign content distribution. Maybe someday in the future there’ll be an opportunity for us in China, it’s possible. We are continuing to work on it.” Another growth area often mooted for Netflix is sports and news, yet Hastings is dismissive of both. “Every incremental million dollars we spend, we want to strengthen our movies and TV shows. No to sports, and no to news. We want to do better movies and TV shows.” It’s a tactic that has worked so far, and Hastings is banking on the world’s appetite for top-notch TV being far from sated.

Yoo, a computer engineering student college student, decided to solve this problem on his own. Using Google’s map data and computer coding he created an app for Android OS smartphones called “Find Toilets,” and provided it for free. The app shows 10,000 public toilets in Songdo as well as nationwide. It also comes with a review on the cleanliness of the facilities. Last year there were a lot of rumors over hospitals affected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome circulating both online and offline, worsening fears about the contagious disease that swept across the country. However, MERS Map, an app that mapped out hospitals that suspected MERS patients visited based on the government’s announcement, helped drum down the fears. In just a week after its release, more than 5 million users downloaded the app. This app was not developed by the government but a private company that was provided it for free. The toilet and the MERS maps apps are just two of the “civic hacking” movements where the private sector provided social services using digital technologies. Creators of the apps and related websites have been dubbed civic hackers. Civic hackers are different from past civic protesters in that instead of complaining about their disappointment with the government they try to innovatively solve problems using tools such as apps, Catherine Bracy, director of community organizing for Code for America, said during a TED forum in 2014. Young people in their 20s and 30s, who are more accustomed to IT technologies than their parents’ generations, participate in civic hackings in two forms. Individuals with computer programming skills build apps and websites, useful living tools, for free. Such is the popular Seoul Bus app that was developed in 2009 by then-high school student Yoo Joo-wan. The app allows users to find bus stations, bus routes as well as the location of vehicles on the routes. Currently, more than 10 million people use the app, which Kakao acquired in 2014 and rebranded as Kakao Bus in April this year. Civil hacking also occurs when a group of people with the same interests work jointly on solving a problem. There are several civil hacking communities with “code” attached to it such as Code for Seoul and Code for Incheon where everyone from high school students to college professors participate. “As [computer] coding has become widespread, the number of young people who are wanting to participate in public interest projects applying software skills have been increasing,” said Lee Joong-seek, a convergence science and technology professor at Seoul National University, who also led Code for Gwanak last year. Code for Incheon, which tries to solve problems in Songdo, meets every Wednesday. The members initially were part of the Code for Seoul that was formed in 2014 but spun off last year as they wanted to focus more on their own neighborhood’s problems. Yoon, creator of the toilet app, is a co-leader of the Incheon civic hackers. At a recent meeting of Code for Incheon, members created a digital alarm map using Google Maps to alert Incheon residents about places they need to avoid because of strong stenches. “In Songdo because of the industrial waste coming from the Namdong Industrial Complex, the stench is really bad and you need to cover your nose to pass by,” said Han In-seon, 33, a hagwon tutor. Code for Seoul is developing an app that shows restaurants and cafes most frequented by lawmakers. The app was developed based on 2014 data on lawmakers’ political spending. The app showed that Gasiri, a Korean restaurant in Yeouido, was the restaurant most visited by lawmakers, where the most expensive item on the menu is 80,000 won. “We wanted to know how political donations were spent for what purposes,” said Cho Yong-hyun, who helped create the app. “We didn’t have [the anticorruption legislation] Kim Young-ran Act in mind when we started it but it is similar to the intention of the Kim Young-ran Act, which is to monitor the activities of lawmakers.” Oh Si-young, a member of Code for Incheon, said hacking often gets a bad rap. “There are negative images of criminal acts like stealing other people’s sensitive information,” Oh said. “But hacking is [actually] contributing the development of society by quickly applying technology.” Technology insiders project that civic hacking will grow. “Civic hacking is a new form of activity that desires social values based on networking,” said Yee Jae-yeol, a social science professor at Seoul National University. “One can see it as a new form of lifestyle centered on young generations in a time of information sharing rather than a strong sense of moral obligation or responsibility.” Information and data used to be exclusively held by major portal companies like Naver and Daum, said Lee Joon-hwan, a communications professor at Seoul National. “But today as there are numerous public data that people can utilize, civic hacking will become more widespread and more active.” BY KIM YOO-VIN [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr] Tweet 페이스북 트위터 MSN 싸이 공감 | URL 줄이기 복사 URL 줄이기 레이어 닫기 dictionary | 프린트 메일로보내기 내블로그에 저장

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:25 PM, August 14, 2016 Updated: 8:32 PM, August 14, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO — Born in Google’s shadow, Niantic strode into the spotlight with a mobile internet spin on hunting Pokemon but can the obsession with the game lead to long-term financial success? Niantic founder and chief executive John Hanke has told a story of naming the company after a whaling ship abandoned in San Francisco Harbor by crew members who rushed off to seek fortunes during the famed Gold Rush. The ship was run aground and converted into a store. The notion of such long-forgotten wrecks prompted Mr Hanke six years ago to use the name Niantic to christen a quest to combine gaming, mobile mapping and augmented reality to playfully reveal virtual things hidden in the real world. Niantic was a side-project for Mr Hanke at Google, which had bought the entrepreneur’s startup Keyhole in 2004 and turned it into the free mapping service Google Earth. Mr Hanke spent years as a top executive in a Google “geo” division producing widely used services such as Maps and Street View. The gamer wanted to go beyond helping people navigate and have fun with the ability for mobile devices to detect people’s locations. The entrepreneur toyed with the idea of launching a new startup, but instead kept Niantic anchored in the Silicon Valley technology powerhouse. “Staying at Google gave us the advantage of being able to tap into the data we have at (mapping division) Geo and the infrastructure of Google,” Mr Hanke was quoted as saying in a 2012 Inc magazine article. PORTALS TO POKEMON The Niantic project fielded its first offering in 2011 in the form of a mobile application called Fieldtrip that served up information about where smartphone users were or nearby places of interest. The following year, Niantic launched a game called “Ingress”, seen as a predecessor to “Pokemon Go”. Ingress, which has been downloaded more than 15 million times, also uses real world surroundings as the game board. Instead of trying to catch cartoon monsters such as iconic Pikachu by targeting them with “Pokeballs”, Ingress players battle for control of virtual portals. Early Ingress fans submitted pictures of places as possible portals complete with satellite position metadata, essentially crowdsourcing a rich geo-location database that was put to use in Pokemon Go. When Google underwent a corporate restructuring last year to divvy its endeavours into arms of a freshly-created parent company called Alphabet, Niantic went independent. Google did invest in Niantic, as did Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Niantic claims from 50 to 100 employees. The private company does not make its financial information public but some analysts value it at more that US$3 billion (S$4 billion). To justify such a valuation, Niantic will have to prove that Pokemon Go is a lasting and profitable, not just another passing fling for notoriously fickle mobile game players. Pokemon Go has shown it can make money. Industry tracker Sensor Tower estimated that Pokemon Go generated more than US$200 million in revenue during the month after its release in early July. The game is free, but players can buy virtual supplies such as PokeBalls and lures to attract Pokemon. Cafes, pubs, restaurants and other venues have taken to buying lures that tempt players to linger, and hopefully spend money, while waiting to catch Pokemon. SPONSORS During a recent Venture Beat technology conference, Mr Hanke said that the game was designed from the outset for in-app purchases, and that revenue could also be made from sponsorships along the lines of what was done in Ingress. Ingress has portals hosted in commercial spots such as shopping centres, and Pokemon Go launched in Japan with fast food giant McDonald’s sponsoring in-game locations. “We are talking to a bunch of other businesses that want to take advantage of that model for Pokemon Go in other parts of the world,” Mr Hanke said at the conference. “It’s promising.” A strong selling point for Pokemon Go sponsorships is that they get people swarming to places in a way that typical advertising does not. The power of Pokemon Go has, to some, become a bane. Parks and other public venues ripe with PokeStops or “gyms” where cartoon creatures battle are at times over run with players. Authorities have taken to warning Pokemon Go players against venturing where it is dangerous, illegal, in poor taste, or they are simply not wanted. The game and its creator are already in the sites of lawyers intent on suing to hold them accountable for trespassing or injuries involving players. The Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center has called for US regulators to investigate whether Niantic is collecting too much information about players and their whereabouts.

Facebook, Amazon.com and Alphabet set themselves apart from other Standard & Poor's 500 index companies by paying bosses almost exclusively in stock grants that are free from any links to performance goals. Erin Lubin/Bloomberg File Photo 2014   Anders Melin (c) 2016, Bloomberg     Amazon.com, Alphabet and Facebook have upended the establishments in retailing, advertising and media -- so it may not come as a surprise that their pay plans are unusual too. The three set themselves apart from other Standard & Poor's 500 index companies by paying bosses almost exclusively in stock grants that are free from any links to performance goals. The vast majority of the biggest U.S. companies tie most of their top executives' pay to targets disclosed in regulatory filings, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. Paying in stock rather than cash helps boards align management rewards with performance and tying those grants to specific financial or operational milestones can reinforce that approach. Yet for businesses in hot industries like tech, boards may prefer plans that don't reveal company targets and that help retain highly sought-after executives by guaranteeing their potential payouts. "A pay program that isn't strictly bound to a formula gives the board more latitude to adjust to situations in real time," said Steven Hall Jr., a consultant at executive compensation advisory firm Steven Hall & Partners. "And how much detail do you really want to disclose in proxy filings and reveal to competitors?" Amazon avoids linking compensation to performance criteria because doing so "could cause employees to focus solely on short-term returns at the expense of long-term growth and innovation," according to a filing. The company typically grants executives biennial stock awards that vest over six years. Google parent Alphabet also grants equity every other year, a strategy it has said "encourages executives to take a long-term view." The payout isn't contingent on performance objectives and typically happens over several years. Executives have previously been eligible for discretionary annual bonuses based on individual and company achievements. Those were eliminated this year for most participants, a filing shows. Spokesmen for Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook declined to comment. In an industry where ideas are plentiful but talent is scarce, companies are racing to recruit engineers and executives able to upend existing business models with promises of equity-laden pay packages. That's helped drive compensation at tech's top echelon to levels rarely seen since the financial services industry before the 2008 crash. Examples include the $199 million grant awarded to Sundar Pichai after he was selected to run Google. Big run-ups in share prices coupled with founders holding controlling stakes might have given some businesses leeway to use more liberal pay practices without upsetting investors, said David Larcker, a professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. "Talent makes or breaks a company -- that's true everywhere but it's especially true here," Larcker said about the tech industry. "If the view is, 'This person is going to put us over the top and create multiples of what we're going to pay him,' then they're going to tailor that package to get that person." Facebook and Alphabet have latitude in pay decisions because their founders hold controlling stakes in the businesses, ensuring that they always pass advisory say-on-pay elections and secure approval to refill the supply of shares used to pay employees. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns a 17 percent stake in the online retailer. All three received more than 90 percent support in their most recent advisory shareholder votes on pay programs. Shares awarded to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's four top lieutenants in 2015 made up more than 80 percent of their total pay, compared with an average of 60 percent for S&P 500 CEOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They will be fully vested by 2021 as long as the four remain employed by the company, a filing shows. The executives are also eligible for annual bonuses based on goals including user-base growth and progress toward long-term investments. Facebook said it anticipates to increase the share of cash compensation to "move closer to market" relative to its peers, without specifying if it'll be tied to performance. Vesting periods of at least four years are necessary for companies that rely exclusively on time-based stock awards to "gear individuals toward taking a longer-term view," said Aalap Shah, managing director at executive pay firm Pearl Meyer. An absence of metrics from pay plans hardly means that executives don't have goals they must achieve to get paid, he said. While investors and regulators have pressed companies to be transparent with compensation decisions, granular performance goals can be a window to a management team's plans. Avoiding that sort of disclosure can be a plus for tech companies that are navigating uncharted territory. IBM Corp. ties Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty's annual bonus and long-term awards to targets it didn't list in filings because they could "signal IBM's strategic focus areas." Outside Silicon Valley, top executives whose compensation isn't linked to goals are typically founders who already hold significant stakes in their businesses. Examples include modestly paid Warren Buffett, founder of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Whole Foods Market Inc.'s co-CEO John Mackey, who receives a $1 salary. Performance-based compensation became popular in the 1990s after a change to the tax code allowed companies to deduct those amounts, a legislative effort to make boards pay bosses only if the company did well. That exemption doesn't apply to restricted shares not linked to results, even though their value varies with the stock price. As they mature, tech companies tend to revert to more traditional pay practices. Apple, the world's largest company by market value, granted CEO Tim Cook a $376 million stock award in 2011, scheduled to vest over the next decade. It was modified in 2013 at Cook's own request to vest in part based on the company's stock performance. In 2014, the company added similar conditions to equity awards for other executives as well. --- Hideki Suzuki contributed.

Published Aug 14, 2016, 11:59 am IST Updated Aug 14, 2016, 11:59 am IST Google is rumoured to be working on a new operating system called Fuchsia.  The name has been derived from a genus name, Fuchsia which stands for a strong, vivid purplish red based on the flowers primarily cultivated in North America. Most of Google’s operating systems including Chrome and Android have been functioning on Linux. While, these have been able to facilitate majority of the requirements; Google seems to apparently be working on a third operating system. According to the  code repository appeared on GitHub and Google Source, it will be called Fuchsia and will operate across wide range of devices. It will make use of a custom version of Little Kernel called ‘Magenta’ that will be tuned for modern phones and personal computers. The inner constructs of Magenta are based on Little Kernel but the layers above are new. For example, Magenta has the concept of a process but the latter doesn’t. However, a Magenta process is made by LK-level constructs such as threads and memory. What’s more? Fuchsia is also said to make use of Google’s Dart programming language, as well as the company's Material Design-friendly Flutter user interface framework. For now, this is as far as we can get to know about this rumored concept by Google. We’ hear about it as and when the developers make it official.

Max Gradel comes on for Bournemouth, replacing fellow Leeds alumnus Lewis Cook, who will have enjoyed the first half of his debut more than the second.

Blind and Bailly, both of whom have staked a claim for a regular centre-back berth today, exchange passes across the back line. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.04am EDT 10:04 74 mins: Here comes Henrikh Mkhitaryan, on for Juan Mata. He’s been one of United’s best performers today. “I don’t think you gave that Zlatan goal enough credit” reckons Matt Richman. “He made that look easy from what might have been about 30 yards.” It was a sign of Ibrahimovic’s many talents to even attempt that shot, but no Premier League goalkeeper should get beaten along the ground from that far out.

He plays a simple ball to Ibrahimovic, who strikes a low, angled shot from some 25 yards. It rolls into the far corner, beyond Boruc, who ought to have stopped it – perhaps caught cold by Ibrahimovic’s audacity. It’s Zlatan time, or something.

Here's the Answer Ever Wondered What Are those White Lines on Your Smartphone? Here's the Answer By: Chakri Kudikala Updated: Wednesday, August 17, 2016, 10:48 [IST] Smartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Google, HTC, Sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. Also Read:This is what the dot on your Samsung earpiece indicates! The trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. Also Read: How to Wisely Make a Choice While Buying In-Ear Earphones You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! What Actually Are Those White Lines? The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. Who Started This? Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back. Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language.   Are they harmful? Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. Followed by? Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6. Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. The ZenFone 3 Series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

But is nationalism always so bad? Not, it seems, for the millions of people around the world watching the Rio Olympics. They watch as the TV networks keep track of the metal count — and they root for the men and women they see representing their nations. Americans were thrilled to see Michael Phelps propel the U.S. swim team to gold in the freestyle relay and excited to watch 19-year-old Katie Ledecky destroy the field in the 400-meter freestyle. People who watch gymnasts at only four-year intervals were amazed at the skill of the 4-foot-9-inch Simone Biles. News coverage in other countries has focused on their own athletes. British front pages flashed pictures of record-breaking breaststroker Adam Peaty, mouthing the words of “God Save the Queen” as he held his gold meal. Brazil’s TV Globo showed judo medalist Rafaela Silva, who grew up in a Rio favela, bow down on her knees to Brazilian fans in the stands. Sports nationalism easily embraces ethnic and racial diversity, not only from historically biracial America and Brazil (which abolished slavery in 1865 and 1888) but also from European and other nations. One Olympic table-tennis match featured a Japanese-descended Brazilian and a Chinese-descended Congolese. People from nations with sharply divisive politics (not least our own) and suffering from economic setbacks and pervasive corruption (like the Olympics host, Brazil) nonetheless find themselves united in rooting for their country’s athletes. An elite globalist may scoff at the arbitrariness of national borders and style himself “a citizen of the world,” as Barack Obama described himself before a massive crowd in Berlin in 2008. But most people don’t think of themselves that way. Nation-states inspire loyalties in a way the United Nations or the European Union have failed to do. Nationalism, properly understood, can be a positive force, welding otherwise disparate people together to build a decent society, secure a competent government and rally to defend themselves against attack. Each nation has developed its own particular culture, its own manners and mores, its own rules, written and unspoken. An intelligent nationalist can respect the strengths of other nations, while preferring his own, just as an Olympics fan can appreciate the superb performance of athletes from other countries even while keeping an eye on the medal scoreboard. The social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, writing in The American Interest, notes that as nations grow more prosperous, their elites become more globalist in outlook, and consider nationalism as blind prejudice or even racism. But, as he writes, “having a shared sense of identity, norms and history” — e.g., nationalism — “generally promotes trust.” “Nationalists feel a bond with their own country, and they believe that this bond imposes moral obligations both ways,” he goes on. “Citizens have a duty to love and serve their country, and governments are duty bound to protect their own people.” This is a principle that Donald Trump, in between off-the-cuff gaffes and self-harming diversions, affirms. Nations have boundaries and owe greater duties to their citizens than to foreigners. They have no obligation to open their borders entirely. It is not racist, Haidt argues, to bar those “whom they perceive as having values that are incompatible with their own, or who (they believe) engage in behaviors they find abhorrent, or whom they perceive to be a threat to something they hold dear.” Even Democrats at their national convention found it useful to sound nationalist themes, decrying Trump’s “dark” picture of America in his acceptance speech as somehow unpatriotic and installing more prominent American flags on the stage. And former Treasury Secretary and Obama adviser Lawrence Summers has called for “a responsible nationalism” which recognize government’s responsibility “to maximize the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good.” Evidently, nationalism, like rooting for your nation’s Olympians, is not necessarily a bad thing.

And the developments are timely, as some European countries - Spain for example - are drawing up lists of guidelines on restrictions that over-65s may face on their driving licences in the not-to-distance future. These include limits on mileage per journey, speed, driving on motorways and driving at night depending on medical condition. A fully trained car could come to the rescue. Scientists are working on deep-learning frameworks which will evolve today's semi-autonomous cars into self-driving vehicles that can handle all traffic scenarios, in all environments, by learning from experience rather than being pre-programmed for every eventuality. Deep-learning frameworks is a form of artificial intelligence, which scientists plan to build into on-board computers which can learn to make big calls, like choosing between hitting a bus queue or a stray dog. The deep-learning frameworks technology gets computers to mimic neurons (cells in the human body specialised in carrying messages through an electrochemical process - the human brain has approximately 100bn neurons) by creating artificial neural networks to quickly absorb and pass on information on road and traffic conditions. Toyota has invested $1bn into its Toyota Research Institute which has autonomous vehicles as a priority and Intel has acquired Altera, a maker of programmable logic devices with automotive applications for $1.6bn. Experts at both companies are developing autonomous cars that not only adhere to set protocols like keeping between white lines, but react to unpredictable scenarios too. Toyota research expert Dr Gill Pratt says that part of the Institute work is to focus on augmenting machine learning and measuring the robustness of systems for all types of scenarios, while Altera's partner in the UK, i-Abra, is developing deep-learning frameworks for autonomous cars. "Ultimately you are trying to replace human sense and action with artificial intelligence by acting on data collected from the car's sensors, cameras, radar and maybe audio," says managing director Ian Taylor. "If bricks fall off a truck the idea is to stop the car as quickly as possible," he says. "The car can learn from experience and then share the experience across a fleet that is constantly connected. The moral maze is presented every day to humans - do you hit the deer or the tree? If a human can make the decision, a computer can too." Taylor admits that machines are fallible but far less so than humans. "The fully autonomous car would not only have more experience than a 17-year-old driver, but also his father. Autonomous cars will also save fuel, cut journey times and save lives," he argues.

It’s all go with Pokemon Go August 14, 2016 01:00 By Pattarawadee Saengmanee The augmented-reality game takes Thailand by storm AFTER BECOMING an instant hit with gamers in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Europe last month, interactive augmented reality game Pokemon Go finally landed in Thailand earlier this week and quickly brought pedestrian traffic to a standstill as residents of all ages took to the streets to locate and capture the virtual creatures.  Of course, there’s nothing new about the adorable mouse-like monster Pikachu and his friends. Older gamers will remember them well from the role-playing video games developed for the Game Boy back in the 1990s. Now, though, the game is using the mobile phone’s camera and gyroscope to render a live background, making players feel that they are encountering a Pokemon in the real world. Developed by Niantic Lab, an internal startup within Google, this new mobile application is designed for IOS and Android devices and took over from Niantic’s initial trans-reality game, called Ingress. Fun and creative for youngsters and adults, there are 151 Pokemon to catch based on their move set, behaviours and where they live. A gamer is called “trainer” and can create an avatar by designing its hairstyle, skin colour and outfits. More than 100 million gamers around the world have so far downloaded the free application. This virtual game uses the Google Maps database to show the locations of PokeStops. These provide players with items like the Poke Ball, monster eggs and potion. In other countries they are often discovered around sculptures and monuments but in Thailand you can find them at spirit houses and shrines, which explains why some young trainers spend their days hovering around temples. Bangkok’s gigantic shopping malls, parks and office buildings – even The Nation’s office building on Bangna-Trat Road – are converted into gyms, where trainers at level 5 can send their monsters to improve their skills on the battleground. Pokemon fans have already set up a Pokemon Go Thailand Fanclub on Facebook to serve as a community for like-minded folk Led by someone calling himself Admin K, this page is designed to help update new movements and guide players through the technical terms. “I played Pokemon on Game Boy 20 years ago. When I grew up, I wondered when it would become available on a mobile phone. I heard that Niantic had teamed up with Nintendo and Pokemon Company in the middle of last year and have been looking forward to its arrival ever since. My friends and I set up this page in February for fans of the Pokemon game to learn more. I think we are already the biggest community of Pokemon Go gamers with more than 140,000 followers,” Admin K says. “I love the Pokemon Go concept of combining reality and fantasy. We are all familiar with the Pokemon characters. You just say ‘Pikachu’ and people know what you’re talking about. The selling point of Pokemon Go is that groups of monsters are randomised to appear in several places and there are rare monsters that are specific to each continent,” he continues. “But I’d like to caution players about the need to stay safe. Don’t try and catch monsters while you’re riding or driving. Parents should take care of their kids and guide them to play the game in the right way.” Nat, a 30-year-old entrepreneur, was a Pokemon fan back when it was played on Game Boy and has been following the news about the Pokemon Go App since it first leaked two years ago. “I had a chance to play Pokemon Go when I spent a holiday in Scandinavia last month. It’s an interactive game and great fun. It brings people together. You can smile at a crowd of strangers in a park while catching a Pokemon and they smile back. You can use AR technology to capture a picture with monsters,” Nat says.  “I worry though about the emotional quotient of Thai gamers. We should focus on safety first and foremost. The number of downloads is falling because there’s no new content. But I’ve heard that Niantic is developing a battle system and gamers can trade their monsters with friends too.” Kusuma Pholthampalit, a Thai student in the UK, is another keen trainer. “The app wasn’t available in the UK at first so my friends linked our account to a server in Australia and New Zealand. Now, the game is very popular here. I’m at level 22 and I like this game. Normally, I’m very lazy about moving around and this game pushes me to walk. When we get a monster egg, we have to walk between two and 10 kilometres to incubate it, which has to be good exercise. The game also forces us to travel around town because PokeStops are often at well-known tourist attractions like churches, art venues, museums or even convenience stores.” Kusuma says.  “However, we should play it the right way and be concerned about safety too. I know in the UK some people have been hit by a car because they keep looking at their phones to try and capture a Pokemon.”  Citing public concerns of potential dangers from the popular game, Thailand’s National Broadcasting and Telecom Commission (NBTC) recently urged US-based Niantic Inc, to consider removing Pokemons and so-called PokeStops from certain places, including footpaths, railroads and canal banks as well as from temples, pagodas, schools, hospitals, and government and military buildings. The NBTC also urged the developer to restrict availability of the game at night to prevent children suffering accidents in public places. At a forum at Chulalongkorn University titled “Where Pokemon Go Will Take Thai Society” last Thursday, adult psychiatrist Dr Puchong Laorujisawat of Chulalongkorn University’s medical faculty, pointed out that the key to preventing people from causing problems for themselves or others while playing the game was basic self control. “If one does not have discipline and self control, no matter which games are introduced, there will be a problem,” Puchong said. Associate Professor Panrapee Suthiwan, a psychologist specialising in child and adolescent development, noted that the game could also bring parents and their children together. “We can turn things around by playing with children and teaching them how to play without causing problems. We can use the game as a link between parents and children. There are good and bad sides to Pokemon Go but we just have to pick the way to use it wisely,” Panrapee said. Entrepreneurs have been quick to jump on the Pokemon Go bandwagon. Pong, who works as a marketing officer in Nakhon Ratchasima, has set up a TaxiDriverPokemonGo page on Facebook to offer taxi services starting at Bt100 for a motorbike and Bt280 for a car per hour. “I noticed young gamers always ride a motorcycle to catch the monsters. Because they are not concentrating fully on the road, they might get into an accident. It’s better to have a driver take them,” Pong says. The people behind the popular GrabTaxi mobile application have also recognised the game’s potential and have introduced a special promotion called Grab Go that offers a free service for three hours for touring around town to capture a Pokemon. In Phuket, meanwhile, the Phuket Tour Holiday travel agency offers a city tour that takes gamers to find a Pokemon in several popular spots. The fee ranges from Bt1,900 for a sedan and Bt3,500 for a van for a six-hour service.  Next month, Nintendo will be launching Pokemon Go Plus, a collection of Bluetooth low-energy wearable devices that allow players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smartphone. The device will help users get items from the PokeStop and vibrate when a Pokemon is close by.   Tags pokemon Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Remembering our Monarch...

All is energy and activity. The administrative logjam created by the EU referendum has finally been broken. ‘Action this day!’ is Whitehall’s new rallying cry. Yet at the same time a vacuum is developing. And it is developing around the Prime Minister’s desk. The announcement last week that the Government plans to lift the ban on grammar schools left Ministers, MPs and civil servants scratching their heads, wondering where it had come from. Yesterday I was discussing Theresa May’s first speech on the steps of No 10 with one of her Cabinet Ministers, writes DAN HODGES. She had, I said, surprised me with her strongly socially progressive narrative. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘that’s all Nick Timothy' A quick Google search and they had their answer – an interview that Theresa May’s new joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, had given in 2015 in which he declared: ‘A new wave of academically selective grammar schools should be created to give parents more choice.’ Two weeks earlier, MPs, civil servants and journalists had also been stunned when No 10 announced – contrary to all expectations – that a final decision to build the first new nuclear power plant in Britain for a generation, at Hinkley Point in Somerset, had been postponed. Again they looked for an explanation. Again, a quick Google search provided the answer – an article by Timothy from last October in which he issued a graphic warning that Chinese investment in the Hinkley project risked ‘allowing a hostile state easy access to the country’s critical national infrastructure’.

Share this article Share 13 shares Yesterday I was discussing Theresa May’s first speech on the steps of No 10 with one of her Cabinet Ministers.  She had, I said, surprised me with her strongly socially progressive narrative. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘that’s all Nick Timothy.’ Over the past month we have heard a lot about Timothy. His working class Birmingham upbringing. His own passion for social mobility. His unflinching loyalty to May. We’ve heard a fair bit about Fiona Hill, as well. She is May’s other joint chief of staff, a former Sky News journalist with a formidable reputation for driving through May’s agenda when they worked together at the Home Office. Fiona Hill is May’s other joint chief of staff, a former Sky News journalist Collectively, Timothy and Hill are already being described as May’s ‘gate-keepers’ – or at least that’s what they’re being called by some people having trouble getting through the gate. ‘If you look at the first Cabinet meeting, Nick and Fiona made a point of sitting directly behind Theresa,’ said one Cabinet Minister. ‘Ed Llewellyn [David Cameron’s chief of staff] would always make himself scarce, or at least make sure he didn’t get in the pictures. They were making a statement.’ If we have heard a lot about Timothy, and a fair bit about Hill, the one person we haven’t heard that much about is May herself. And that is starting to create a problem. Precisely who is Theresa May? What is her guiding philosophy? What is underpinning the decisions she is making on behalf of the country?  Most importantly, when is the country going to be granted an insight into her thinking, rather than the thinking of her senior advisers? This vacuum is partly a product of circumstance.  The sudden truncation of the leadership election robbed May of the opportunity to set out her intellectual stall. It is also a product of her time at the Home Office, a department where circumspection and discretion are a core part of the ethos, as well as a reflection of her desire to retrench into a more traditional and reserved model of governance. Nor are Timothy and Hill guilty of self-aggrandisement. One senior adviser to Cameron spoke warmly of his successors. ‘They’re both really good people, and they’re serious people. They’ve got a different set of priorities to us, but they know what they’re doing. And they’d die in a ditch for Theresa.’ Given the fate that befell Cameron, such fealty is both understandable and commendable. But the reality is that people are going to need to see and hear more from May than at present. ‘What I think is, she’s a vicar’s daughter with a very strong sense of fairness and natural justice,’ said one of her Cabinet Ministers. Then he added: ‘But to be honest, I don’t know any more about her than you do.’ Opening up – to her colleagues and to the British people – isn’t going to be easy for the notoriously private May. She is pictured here with her husband, Philip Another spelled out what they already see as a gap opening between Downing Street and the other Government departments. ‘They already want to sign off on everything. Fine. But that means we need to be aligned with them. And at the moment we’re having to try to guess precisely what it is the PM wants.’ Opening up – to her colleagues and to the British people – isn’t going to be easy for the notoriously private May.  One of the most remarkable aspects of her ascent is that it was achieved with the help of very few close parliamentary allies. And anyone who saw the Michael Phelps-like death stare she directed at photographers during the arranged photoshoot that started her holiday would be in no doubt to what she thinks of the media. But that isn’t the whole picture. Downing Street officials who met her as she toured their offices for the first time report being pleasantly surprised at her relaxed and informal demeanour. ‘She was enjoying some genuine banter with us all,’ says one. Another long-standing Downing Street aide says he has detected a distinct change in May since she took up residence in No 10. ‘Before, it was David Cameron’s house, and she wasn’t that close to him. So I think she felt uncomfortable coming in here. ‘Now she’s looking much less tense. It’s like she said to herself, “Right, this is my place now.” She looks at home.’ It’s Theresa May’s house. It’s Theresa May’s country. When she returns from holiday, she needs to start to spell out what she intends to do with it.   OWEN'S A CHAMPION LOSER Ed Miliband famously had his ‘35 per cent strategy’ – the belief that if he could secure that percentage of the vote in last year’s Election he would become PM. Now, I am told, Owen Smith is pursuing a new version – the ‘40 per cent strategy’. Although the official line from Smith and other Labour rebels is that he is still pushing hard to defeat Jeremy Corbyn, in reality few people believe that is a realistic possibility. Instead they have identified a threshold of 40 per cent of the total votes, which they believe is the minimum he must achieve for his challenge to be a ‘success’. The thinking is that this would leave Labour MPs ‘within striking distance’ of Corbyn, paving the way for a fresh leadership challenge some time next year. It would also make it unlikely that Corbyn and his allies would be able to mobilise sufficient activists to mount a concerted attempt to deselect MPs in revenge for the coup. This is because while Labour ‘supporters’ may cast a vote for the party leader, only full members get a say in selecting MPs. According to insiders, Len McCluskey’s Unite union is currently setting up affiliated branches in several Constituency Labour Parties with a view to inflicting ‘punishment beatings’ on the rebels. But unless Corbyn can himself break the 60 per cent barrier, the feeling is they will not have sufficient strength to unseat many sitting MPs. ‘The fact is, Corbyn doesn’t have the numbers to throw out any half-decent constituency MP,’ said one former Shadow Minister. ‘Unite can organise, but then we’ll just get the GMB to counter-organise. And then it’s stalemate.’ So stalemate beckons if Owen Smith’s 40 per cent strategy works. And that’s quite a big ‘if’. Just ask Ed Miliband.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Why this former Google and Amazoner decided to ditch big company life to join a mattress startup (GOOG) Saturday Aug 13, 2016 at 3:33 PM Jillian D'Onfro Casper Eric Lewis had a long history of working at giant companies. He's an alum of Black & Decker, Amazon, and most recently Google, where he worked on its Express team, overseeing the launch of its same-day delivery service to seven different metropolitan areas.  But when the mattress startup Casper — comparatively tiny at 100 employees and $100 million in sales last year — came knocking, he didn't hesitate. "From my first discussion with Philip I knew that I wanted to be a part of [it]," he tells Business Insider, of his talks with Casper founder Philip Krim.  New York City-based Casper is known for delivering fluffy mattresses in boxes the size of golf bags, and has raised $70 million in venture capital funding since launching in 2014.  Lewis, hired as the VP of global operations, rounds out the company's executive team as it launches in the UK. "The opportunity to grow this business across the globe was the 'pillows on the bed,' as they say," Lewis quips.  With Lewis' hire, the company also snapped up a chief marketing officer (Micheal Behrens) and a new head of retail and business development (Taryn Laeben).  Lewis says that three years at Google Express taught him a lot but that Casper's rapid scaling and "very strong demand" enticed him. At massive organizations like Amazon and Google he got to work on wide-reaching projects, but now he has more control. Plus, his new startup life means moving very quickly and having a direct line to the company's founders.  Express, run by executive Brian Elliott, is the company's competitor to Amazon, and delivers both groceries and other goods to people in about 10 different areas. It has flown a bit under the radar since its founder Tom Fallows left for Uber in 2014.  NOW WATCH: How to find Pokémon in 'Pokémon Go' See Also:The founder of Google Ventures is leavingGoogle is expanding its tests on the way to blanketing the US in super-fast wireless internetYahoo's list breaking down its competition shows the company still has no idea what it really is SEE ALSO: Google is expanding its tests on the way to blanketing the US in super-fast wireless internet About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM, NEWSHOUR WEEKEND ANCHOR: Faced with some of the most expensive rental housing in the nation, many San Francisco Bay Area residents are priced out of the rental market.  An hour’s drive south of San Francisco, in Silicon Valley, a mecca for high-paying American computer and technology industry jobs, some residents are even turning to cars, vans, and RVs as places to live. In tonight’s Signature Segment, Special Correspondent Joanne Jennings reports how this trend exposes an unintended consequence of an economic boom for both the middle class and the working poor. This story is part of our ongoing series “Chasing the Dream,” about poverty and opportunity in America. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Mountain View, California, is home to hundreds of technology firms. From NASA’s Supercomputing Division to tech giant Google, which alone employs twenty thousand people here. The city’s unemployment rate is two-and-a half percent — half the national average — and the median household income tops 100-thousand dollars a year. But there are perils to this prosperity, says Mountain View Mayor Pat Showalter. PAT SHOWALTER: So many people have come here that the rents, because of supply and demand, have gone through the roof. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: The median rent for an apartment or house is four-thousand-three hundred-ninety a month, a 54% jump since 2012. PAT SHOWALTER: It doesn’t matter whether you make $100,000 or not, you haven’t planned for a 54% rent increase. And it’s caused a lot of people to be displaced. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: A small but growing number of the city’s 80,000 residents are now living in recreational vehicles, vans, and cars. Like these on this street next to a park. SCOTT WHALEY: This is my home, and I’m happy here. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: 59-year-old Scott Whaley moved out of his Mountain View apartment into a mini-van last November, when he lost his job as a Property Manager. SCOTT WHALEY: I just moved into my van. I said, you know, until I can find a place. This is my bedroom back here. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Whaley now lives this used, 1997 RV he bought for $10,000, depleting his savings. SCOTT WHALEY: Yes, I would love to have a home. However, this is my home. I’m not homeless. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: A couple miles away, across from an office park. Marcia Christleib also makes her home in an RV. And this is bigger than some of the studios you’ve looked at? MARCIA CHRISTLEIB: It is. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Even though she earns $65,000 a year as an environmental consultant for NASA, Christleib says it’s not enough to support her and her husband, Dennis, who’s looking for work. MARCIA CHRISTLEIB: The only apartment we’ve looked at so far that looks like it’s in a safe neighborhood goes for almost $2,400 a month. That’s a huge portion of a salary, and we’re just going to have to give up other conveniences. I still can only afford the things I could afford when I was making minimum wage, because everything else goes to rent. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: The Christleibs tried to park their RV at a proper campsite. But the only facility in Mountain View that provided power and water hookups is now a construction site. It closed last year after a developer bought the property to build million dollar townhouses. This summer, the city of Mountain View counted 126 vehicles being used as homes. TOM MYERS: It’s very difficult to get good numbers, because homeless individuals are often trying to remain hidden. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Tom Myers is executive director of Mountain View’s community services agency. TOM MYERS: People living in vehicles to this type of degree and number is completely new and completely unheard of in this community. People living in their vehicles is something that we are really, as a community, ill-equipped to be able to handle. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Delmi Ruiz is preparing dinner in the cramped RV she moved into with her husband and three kids last November. Ruiz has worked as a housekeeper in Mountain View for 10 years. Her husband cleans offices. She says the landlord of their last apartment raised their rent three times in the year before they moved out. DELMI RUIZ: The rent started increasing, and we were no longer able to pay for it. JOANNE JENNINGS: So, why do you stay in Mountain View? DELMI RUIZ: Because we’ve always lived in Mountain View. Before it was possible to live here and pay for rent, because it was cheap, but it’s become impossible to live here. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: For other displaced residents who choose to stay in Mountain View, even an RV is too expensive. Dwayne Golstein makes 30-thousand dollars a year as a Pathology Lab Technician but he lived in this rented mini-van for two months. It was retrofitted with a mattress and window curtains. He says it was cheaper and had more privacy than the boarding house where he’d lived before. DWAYNE GOLSTEIN: $200 a week for a bunk bed in a room with five other bunk beds. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: He saved money, but it wasn’t easy. DWYANE GOLSTEIN: I really had to sit down and be honest with myself and say, could I get up every day and take the necessary discipline to not eat after a certain hour? Make sure I could charge my devices every evening; Get up in time if I need to move the van because of parking tickets and so forth, do that. On top of the everyday rigors of getting dressed and being presentable for my employment. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: To keep himself clean and presentable, for $35 a month, Golstein joined a 24-hour gym with showers. DWAYNE GOLSTEIN: It’s usually cold in the evening times when I go to the gym or when I come in, so I keep my sweater. This is my laundry which I’ll take the laundromat once a week. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: For those living in vehicles who can’t afford a gym membership, the nonprofit “Dignity on Wheels” offers mobile shower and laundry services. For his part, Golstein has moved back into a shared apartment. Some Mountain View residents living in vehicles can easily afford an apartment but choose to save money and rough it. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Brandon, who’s 23 and declined to give his last name, earns $175,000 a year as a software engineer. We agreed not to name his employer. He sleeps in this windowless moving truck parked a few blocks from his office in Mountain View. He says he has all the amenities he needs at work. BRANDON: So, there are gyms on the campus where I work. There are showers there naturally. They have cafes where you can grab breakfast lunch and dinner. So, I thought it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to replicate that whole environment at home especially when I wouldn’t be taking advantage of it. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Brandon’s been living in his truck for more than a year and writing a blog about his experience called “From Inside the Box.” BRANDON: It’s a substantial sum of money that I would have just been effectively burning on rent. There’s no equity being built up on anything. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: The savings helped Brandon pay off his $20,000 student loan debt. He’s now maxing out contributions to his retirement plan. A lot of people are blaming the high cost of housing on the tech companies and on the tech workers. BRANDON: Yeah. You have all these high paid workers coming into the area. People or landlords know they can charge more for rent. It ends up becoming totally unsustainable, and intractable for people who don’t have the sort of resources that these tech workers have. I think they’re perfectly justified in blaming us. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: As the largest employer in Mountain View, Google recognizes its high salaries have contributed to an inflated housing market. Rebecca Prozan is a Public Policy Manager at the company’s San Francisco office. REBECCA PROZAN: Obviously, our footprint creates pressure. It creates pressure on housing and transportation, but that pressure isn’t just tech. It’s not just Google. It’s all the industries that are creating the economy of the Bay Area. We all have to work together to figure out what we’re going to look like, and how we’re going to live. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Prozan did not want to address published reports about a handful of its employees living in vehicles to save money. REBECCA PROZAN: I think the issue is that we don’t necessarily want to comment on our employees participating in those activities. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: But she said Google is committed to addressing the problem of homeless in the Bay Area. In Mountain View alone, the company has pledged $1 million for a “rapid rehousing” program. REBECCA PROZAN: This specific grant will work to help those who are on the fringes, either about to lose their home, or about to get into a home in the form of time limited payments, motel rooms, things of that nature to really make sure that people are able to have a home and not live in a car. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: Several California cities have prohibited people from living in vehicles parked on public streets. But in 2014, a Federal appeals court struck down a Los Angeles law that it said “opens the door to discriminatory enforcement against the homeless and the poor.” That caused LA and other cities to rescind their bans. Certainly, Mountain View officials hear their share of complaints. ASHLEY HANSON, MOUNTAIN VIEW RESIDENT: I have mixed feelings. You know, I feel sorry for the people that are there, but we pay a ton of rent to live in our building. And there’s like a lot of garbage. JOANNE ELGART JENNINGS: The sites I saw were mostly clean, and people living in vehicles say the police have been tolerant. Mountain View Mayor Pat Showalter says her approach is to offer help, not punishment. PAT SHOWALTER: The intent is to get everybody the shelter that they need. It just doesn’t seem like impounding somebody’s vehicle, charging them many, many dollars to get it back when they don’t have much money to start with, it just seems like, how does that help?

 Why this former Google and Amazoner decided to ditch big company life to join a mattress startup Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 13, 2016, 4:43 PM 13,320 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Lewis Casper Eric Lewis had a long history of working at giant companies. He's an alum of Black & Decker, Amazon, and most recently Google, where he worked on its Express team, overseeing the launch of its same-day delivery service to seven different metropolitan areas.  But when the mattress startup Casper — comparatively tiny at 100 employees and $100 million in sales last year — came knocking, he didn't hesitate. "From my first discussion with Philip I knew that I wanted to be a part of [it]," he tells Business Insider, of his talks with Casper founder Philip Krim.  New York City-based Casper is known for delivering fluffy mattresses in boxes the size of golf bags, and has raised $70 million in venture capital funding since launching in 2014.  Lewis, hired as the VP of global operations, rounds out the company's executive team as it launches in the UK. "The opportunity to grow this business across the globe was the 'pillows on the bed,' as they say," Lewis quips.  With Lewis' hire, the company also snapped up a chief marketing officer (Micheal Behrens) and a new head of retail and business development (Taryn Laeben).  Lewis says that three years at Google Express taught him a lot but that Casper's rapid scaling and "very strong demand" enticed him. At massive organizations like Amazon and Google he got to work on wide-reaching projects, but now he has more control. Plus, his new startup life means moving very quickly and having a direct line to the company's founders.  Express, run by executive Brian Elliott, is the company's competitor to Amazon, and delivers both groceries and other goods to people in about 10 different areas. It has flown a bit under the radar since its founder Tom Fallows left for Uber in 2014.    Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) Leonardo DiCaprio accepts the award for best actor in a leading role for “The Revenant” at the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 28, 2016, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) (The Associated Press) Gary WarthContact Reporter Celebrities have often used their spotlight to speak about causes they support, and a San Diego State University researcher has found that the public does listen and respond to what they say. John Ayers, who mines social media and other internet sources for trends, found that Leo DiCaprio’s statements about climate change during his Academy Award speech last February resulted in more Twitter comments on the subject than ever. Ayers also found a significant spike in the number of people doing Google searches on the subject, with many using the specific words that DiCaprio included in his talk. “Speaking out is still incredibly rare, and if part of the reason it’s rare is that people don’t think it makes a difference, we can remove that from the equation now,” Ayers said. “We know it does make a difference, and we want more people to be speaking out. That’s the value of our study.” The study was recently published in the Public Library of Science One. Ayers, who worked with UC San Diego communications student Eric Leas on the study, released a similar report earlier this year on the effect of Charlie Sheen’s announcement that he was HIV positive. In that study, Ayers and Leas mined big data and found a record spike in internet searches for HIV information on the day of Sheen’s announcement. Ayers said the new study’s findings are more significant because it could encourage people to speak out more. While the Sheen effect demonstrates that tragic news could have a positive benefit, the DiCaprio effect demonstrates that somebody can deliberately create a benefit. In his speech, DiCaprio thanked people who had helped him in his career and in the making of the movie that earned him an Oscar, then seamlessly worked in a message. “The Revenant was about man’s relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history,” DiCaprio said as he shifted the topic of his speech. DiCaprio said the film crew had to go to “the southern tip of the planet” to find snow for some scenes. “Climate change is real,” he said. “It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” DiCaprio ended saying leaders around the world need to speak for all of humanity and for indigenous people who will be effected by climate change. The comments caught Ayers’ attention when he watched the speech. “I’ve always been interested in these celebrity effects,” he said. “I’m sure celebrities are, too.” In his report, Ayers wrote that Google queries for climate change increased by 261 percent the day of DiCaprio’s speech and remained high for a few days, accounting for 104,109 total searches. At their peak, searches marked the third-highest point ever reached for people seeking information on climate change and global warming on Google. The increase was more than followed Earth Day of the 2015 United Nation’s Climate Change Conference, he wrote. The report also showed that people seemed to be responding directly to DiCaprio’s talk, with searches for the term “hottest year” up 342 percent and “indigenous” up 81 percent on the day of his speech. Searches for related terms such as “electric cars” and “solar panels” had no effect, which Ayers said demonstrates that people in the spotlight should be specific about what calls to action they talk about. In his conclusion, Ayers wrote that the scientific community must start adopting to social media as a way of getting messages to the public. “DiCaprio issued a wake-up call to the public that ignoring climate change poses great peril,” he wrote. “The scientific community must adapt to the 21st century dynamic communication landscape and ready itself for the next opportunity to harness the agents of change.” Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 63°
ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Can banks gain a share of mobile payments market? By Jonathan Duffy (sian@brightbee.co.uk) Shares Mobile payments are gaining momentum in the UK. Apply Pay had the initial monopoly, with Android Pay launching in the UK a year later. A week after Android Pay launched in the UK, 460,000 payments had been accepted. Countries across the globe are increasingly moving towards cashless societies thanks to advances in contactless payments. Instead of carrying a physical wallet with cash and bank cards, mobile wallets are becoming an increasingly popular method of payment. What role will banks play in this new era? The death of the wallet The number of smartphone users worldwide is predicted to grow to 6.1 billion by 2020 according to the 2015 Mobility Report from Ericsson. With the growth of smartphones across the globe and the consequential shifting consumer habits, mobile payments are a natural step beyond plastic cards. Smartphones have become an extension of ourselves; they are always on and we always have them with us. According to payments technology company Adyan, in Q3 2015 47 per cent of UK online transactions were made through mobile devices. Additionally, a report from Mobile Ecosystem Forum tells us that now, an estimated that 69 percent of mobile users globally conduct at least some of their banking using their mobile device. While mobile banking and payments is increasing, on the flip-side the use of cash is dropping. Last year, less than half of consumer payments in the UK were made using cash, according to Payments UK. In 2015, cash made up 45 per cent of payments, compared with 64 per cent in 2005. This number is expected to continue to fall to around 25 per cent by 2025. With millennials being digital-natives and mobile-first, they put online and convenience above physical presence and traditional banking services. Mobile payment apps have added a new and convenient way for people to pay for goods and services. The total value of proximity mobile payments is seeing significant growth in 2016 and has the power to revolutionise the shopping experience, making payments more convenient and faster. It is an attractive option for brands and customers alike as it makes a smoother payment journey for the customer. It is not surprising that major phone-technology players from Apple to Google and Samsung are pushing forward with their mobile wallets, but where does this leave the banks? It is no secret that banks have concerns about the tech giants Apple and Google entering their sectors with mobile wallets and payment solutions. Don’t be the next MVNO The risk of banks losing market share is very real, especially as the likes of Apple build on their consumer relationships to make further progress into mobile payments. Banks need to innovate and explore ways to retain their brand position and their customers’ loyalty or face becoming sidelined. Decreasing revenue and increasing costs are forcing banks, including high-street names, such as Lloyds and Barclays, to lay off employees and automate functions. This tactic of slashing costs can be helpful up to a point, but what about exploiting new markets and technologies to create business and healthier balance sheets? Banks must now compete on technology in order to stay relevant. According to a 2015 survey by software firm Temenos, 27 per cent of senior bankers reported tech companies as the greatest threat to their business. Take Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) as a recent example of a sector overtaken by technology. In the early 2000s they had all the influence over their customers. Fast-forward to 2007 and Apple iPhone is launched. Exclusive contracts with operators were signed (AT&T in the US and O2 in the UK) and the operators’ worst nightmare of becoming ‘dumb pipes’ began turning to reality. Gone are the MVNO heydays; Apple and Google are now the brands most synonymous with mobile innovation. How do banks avoid the same fate? Play tech firms at their own game Banks can ward off tech firms and disrupt the industry if they look at innovative ways to use existing technology quickly. There are a few early movers such as Danske Bank in the Nordic countries which has the MobilePay app using a phone agnostic beacon payment technology, based on Netclearance’s mBeaconPay, to accept payments at retailers. It has over 2.9 million active users and has been installed on an estimated 90 per cent of Denmark’s smartphones. The payment system has also been rolled out to Norway and Finland. Dankse Bank’s mobile wallet is the third most popular app in Denmark and Norway and over 90 million transactions were made through MobilePay in 2015. Cashless societies Denmark is well on its way to becoming the world’s first cashless society and MobilePay shows that frictionless, tech agnostic and highly secure POS systems are winning the hearts and minds of the customer, and delivering real value to merchants. It is enabling banks to retain or even grow their customer base. Tech-savvy consumers, world-leading smartphone penetration and progressive banks have kept the Nordic countries ahead of the game with mobile payments. Mobile payments platforms are providing retailers with an intuitive customer experience via inexpensive technology and remove costly merchant fees as the technology takes transactions direct from bank to retailers, changing the value chain. Without requiring tokenised card details to be held on a database somewhere, the technology is inherently more secure. By directly engaging their customers, banks can also create additional brand loyalty as well as providing a desirable feature to entice new customers. Banks have access to huge, proprietary data about their customers’ spending habits, which some have begun using to offer customers more personalised experiences and recommendations. When combined with partnerships with outside retailers and firms, this data could be used to drive spending and create customer satisfaction on a larger scale than the loyalty program from a single company. Customers want an app that allows them easy access to products they like and so far the big technology firms have all failed to deliver. Frictionless first At its core, mobile payments are about making payments easy and creating a process that is as frictionless and simple as possible whilst also being secure and adding value to the end user. Banks have the ability to provision this through mobile beacon technology and the time is now to start using it in order to stop the tech giants getting there first. Topics Apple Pay.

They want to feel like they're really there. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 13 August, 2016 21:00 - - - - print email Comments What do Snapchat stories, Pokémon Go, Facebook live video and virtual reality all have in common? Two words: virtual experience. In his book, The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future (Amazon), author Kevin Kelly talks about the "internet of experiences," where the internet will increasingly become more about virtual and augmented reality and artificial intelligence-as-a-service, rather than the old "internet of information" that it's been since the beginning. Kelly is right. His "internet of experiences" is inevitable. But why? The reason is obvious: Information overload. The first web site, which was created by web inventor Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, was all about linking pages of information with other pages of information. Since then, just about everyone who produces information has gone online. Plus, there are billions of blog posts, social media messages, articles, podcasts, videos and more online. Bill Gates' 1994 groundbreaking Comdex speech was called "Information at your Fingertips." Google's mission was to "organize the world's information." The boomers and Gen X-ers put a world of information at everyone's fingertips. But the millennials are opting out by demanding more experiences and less information. It's clear that the online and tech-using culture has been moving away from information-based communication for years. Social networking and messaging have evolved gradually in the past five years. Back in 2011, people wrote (and read) multi-paragraph length posts. Over the past five years, the sharing of and engagement on social networking posts have favored pictures, animated GIFs and text-and-picture memes over information-rich posts. One way to look at it is that social interaction has gotten less "literate," moving from paragraphs to sentences to partial sentences to emojis. But it's not really about "literacy," it's about escaping from information overload. Emojis require a kind of emoji literacy, but they communicate vaguely and ambiguously and prioritize feelings and emotions over facts and information. The rise of emojis is a symptom of the decline of information -- or at least, the rise of information avoidance. The growing desire for less information has been accompanied by an increasing desire for more experience. Here's where the public's growing obsession with "virtual experience" over information is already showing up on the internet. 'What it's like' headlines Have you noticed the sudden rise in headlines that use the phrases "what it's like" or "how it feels"? Here are thousands of examples from Google News. This headline trend, which used to be rare, is clearly an attempt to hook a public craving experience, rather than information. Traditionally, a standard news story might start with the headline: "California Woman Loses Home to Wildfire." But the new headline style is: "What It's Like To Lose Your Home To A Wildfire." It's the same story, but to attract experience-craving readers on social media you have to promise a vicarious experience of events, rather than just information about events. And the technique works. People now gravitate to "what it's like" and "how it feels" headlines because people are increasingly repelled by information and attracted to experience. Live video Live mobile video is taking the internet world by storm. It started with Meerkat and Periscope and now Facebook and Google are getting into the act. (Google's live mobile video feature should hit YouTube any day now.) Here's a truism that vloggers, video podcasters, TV professionals and others know well: Whether you watch live or watch a recording, anything that's broadcast live has a distinct quality that is very different from video with multiple takes and polished editing before broadcast. Live video has less of a packaged feeling and more of a "you are really there" vibe to it. The world of online video is growing more popular, and the authentic, unscripted, unedited live format is on the rise because it's less like content consumption and more like experiencing someone else's world. Snapchat and Instagram 'stories' Snapchat fans were a little stunned by the degree to which Instagram essentially copied the Snapchat stories concept. Instagram Stories hit phones in an update Aug. 2, and, like Snapchat stories, it enables the creation of 10-second photo and video clips that vanish after 24 hours. The promotional video for Instagram stories shows, among other scenes, a woman shopping for shoes. She captures a video of the shoes with her phone, then draws a question mark over the video before sending it off to friends. This new way to communicate represents the decline of information and the rise of "virtual experience." This story of the woman shopping for shoes would replace the behavior standard six months ago, where she would have taken a photo of the shoes, messaged them to friends and asked, "what do you think of these shoes?" But in the world of "virtual experience," the question mark replaces information in her request, and the video adds the feeling of experience that isn't easily conveyed with a photo. Most people I know who add images, drawings and words on top of their Snapchat or Instagram stories do so to add a sense of humor or fun to their stories, without explicitly saying so with words. The trend is especially stark on Instagram, where stars used to thrill followers with beautiful photos. Now, when they add stories, the quality is way down, but the feeling of "being there" is way up, making that content more appealing. Pokémon Go and virtual reality Pokémon Go is a huge hit. But why? The game is made by Niantic, a Google spinoff that previous published Field Trip and Ingress. If Pokémon Go is a hit, Field Trip was a flop and Ingress was a semi-hit. What accounts for the relative popularity of Niantic's three apps? If you're unfamiliar with Field Trip, the app alerted you to facts about your current location. For example, it could notify you if you're at the location of a famous movie scene or historical event. Ingress, on the other hand, is a game like Pokémon Go in the sense that it's location based and pits teams against each other. But Ingress is a vastly more complex game than Pokémon Go, with a long list of rules and strategy best practices to learn. There are all kinds of theories about the radical popularity of Pokémon Go. But one way to look at all three apps is that Field Trip focuses on information, Pokémon Go focuses on experience and Ingress is a kind of hybrid of information and experience, and their relative popularity reflects the degree to which each favors experience over information. Virtual reality While mixed reality games and applications like Pokémon Go provide a "virtual experience" lite, full-blown virtual reality (VR) is explicitly and completely about creating "virtual experience." VR is assumed to be all about games. But games, and especially "first-person shooter," "open world" and other game types are already highly experience-oriented. VR games will be great. But the real VR revolution will be in applications that replace information-intensive activities like reading, social networking and business communication with a "virtual experience" of "being there" and "doing that." Of course, we'll always have more information coming at us than we could process in a thousand lifetimes. But the new world of "virtual experience" will give us more appealing and human ways to learn, communicate and play. Now sit back, put on those goggles and experience the rise of "virtual experience."

The study led by  an Indian-origin entrepreneur further says that Facebook staff are less creative compared to other tech workers. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. "The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple's, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook , or IBM employees," Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. "They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn't require them to personally be innovative," Birwadker said. "They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there's always been this layer of innovation," Birwadker explained adding, "but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees." On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. "But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B," Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft's latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work "fun", the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren't necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. "You can't have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there," Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google , Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

Is this the upcoming Nexus smartphone by Google and HTC? By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 14:00 [IST] Google's upcoming smartphones are the most anticipated ones for the year along with the iPhone 7. As per the previous leaks and benchmark reports, we already know that Google is manufacturing two new smartphones namely the Nexus Sailfish and the Nexus Marlin. Also Read: Nexus Sailfish Leaked Specifications Some earlier reports also leaked the render images of both the smartphones, but yesterday, in the process of promoting Google Photos app for Android and iOS in Instagram, Google showed a new smartphone whose design is on par with the leaked render images of Nexus Sailfish. It is a known fact that Google already has the history of doing this. The Search giant also accidentally leaked Nexus smartphone in past. So, the trend continues with this year Nexus smartphones as well. However, it is unclear on which smartphone the video actually has. Based on the screen size, we believe that it will be the Nexus Sailfish as the previous reports suggested that the Sailfish will feature a 5.2-inch display. Photo Credit: google However, Google showed an iOS popup on the screen and the smartphone might be the iPhone SE as well. But, it surely has a 2.5D curved glass and the iPhone won't feature a curved glass. That said, this might well be the upcoming Nexus smartphone from the company which is accidentally released, may be, or it can also be a hint from Google. Also Read: Nexus Sailfish GFXBench Specifications In terms of specifications, both the 2016 smartphones will feature 4GB of RAM and latest Snapdragon 820 chipset. The Sailfish will arrive with a 5.2-inch FHD display and the Nexus Marlin might come with a 5.7-inch QHD display. As seen on the 2015 Nexus smartphones, the fingerprint sensors will be rested on the rear below the camera. The same 12MP camera can be seen on both the smartphones, which gave a tight competition for the 2015 Galaxies.

By Sarmistha Acharya August 13, 2016 09:09 BST Galaxy Note 7 expected to get Android Nougat in two to three months Samsung Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which was unveiled earlier this month, might get Android 7.0 Nougat within another two to three months. Although the exact date of the roll-out is yet to be revealed, but the new Android iteration will be released only after collecting feedback from users. "It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what's more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users. That's why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates," Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung Electronics' mobile communication told the Korean Times. Google made the first preview of Android Nougat, which was unveiled on 9 March 2016, available for developers on the same month. The fifth, which is the last, developer preview update was released in July. Google promises to roll out the final software update starting with the Nexus devices in the third quarter of the year. This means Android Nougat for Note 7 will be available only after that, may be sometime in October or November. Speaking at a press conference in Seoul Koh also said the company was planning for a 128GB version of the Note 7, but only for the Chinese market. Samsung's latest move is a possible consequence of the Chinese smartphone manufacturers who are pushing for aggressive marketing strategies by launching phones with higher storage. "We are considering launching Note 7 with a 128 GB internal storage capacity for the Chinese market, even though the handset made its global debut with a 64 GB memory," said Koh. "We will continue to accept different needs from each marketplace, and respond by releasing localized products by changing memory capacity or color," he added. Featuring different colour variants such as blue coral, gold platinum, silver titanium and black onyx, the new Note will go on sale on 19 August through carriers in the US, followed by a rollout in European market on 2 September.

The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said.

Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. Also Read: Sree Sreenivasan: I look at my job as chief listening officer of New York “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.   Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 24, 2016 Larger / SmallerNight Mode Pokemon GO tips, hacks, facts Dominica Sanda@dominikasanda 13 Jul 2016, 2:30 p.m. What you may or may not know about the popular app like some businesses have banned Pokemon GO gamers. 1. Walking into private property is an offence Avoid venturing onto private land while playing the game. It’s easy to wander into cemeteries, parks, farms, hospitals and police stations (it has been done) while hunting a Pikachu or Charmander, but it is an offence to do so in NSW. Under Section 4 of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901: "Any person who, without lawful excuse (proof of which lies on the person), enters into inclosed lands without the consent of the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands, or who remains on those lands after being requested by the owner, occupier or person apparently in charge of those lands to leave those lands, is liable to a penalty..." The penalty is a hefty $110 fine in the case of a government owned building, school, hospital, child care service or nursing home or $550 in any other case. 2. Learn while you hunt As you probably know, Pokestops are located near historical monuments, artistic features or other locations of cultural interest.  If you take the time to read the name of the Pokestop (instead of swiping madly to catch any items), you will probably learn a thing or two. 3. Some Pokestops are no-go zones There are four Pokéstops in Canberra’s Parliament House that the public can’t get access to. They’re hidden in restricted courtyards on the house of representatives side of parliament and Pokefans need security swipes to get close enough to spin them. Kayza Grenfell captured this Zubat hanging out at Parliament House. Photo: Kayza Grenfell 4. Spin for the win You can spin your Pokéball to get more experience points (XP). This is how it’s done: when you’re capturing a Pokémon, draw a little circle around your Pokéball to give it some spin. That will give you a curveball for bonus XP. INSTA @f1senna 5. You can trade duplicates  If you have one too many of the same Pokemon, you can transfer duplicates to Professor Willow in exchange for candy. Check out your captured Pokémon, then tap on them and transfer them to Professor Willow in exchange for one candy. But, it’s best to do this with low-powered Pokémon that you already have multiple of.  6. It makes people happy...and fit Pokefans across the world have been sharing the fact that the game has improved their mental health and fitness. Some gamers reported to have walked 40kms in just three days. everyone after a week of pokemon go pic.twitter.com/dX9F7NA1YU— PokemonGo™ (@CatchEmAlI) July 13, 2016 7. Beware of businesses The influx of people entering businesses to catch Pokemon has got some owners on the wrong side. Some businesses have put up notices on shop windows asking Pokefans not to enter unless they planned on entering as paying customers. But, some businesses have embraced the revenue opportunities Pokemon GO presents. Cafes have started to offer phone and USB charges with the purchase of coffee or cake to help Pokefans catch ‘em all. Be aware of the shops you enter. 8. Google docs, emails, images: it wants to catch 'em all If you're playing the game on an iPhone or other Apple device, signing in to Pokemon GO gives the app full access to your Google-powered life. This includes the ability to sift through emails, documents and files associated with your Google email address. The Android version of the app doesn't ask for full access to the user's Google account. After privacy concerns surfaced this week, Niantic issued a new version of the app on iOS on Wednesday, July 13, which has more limited access to your Google account. This will come into effect once you update the app. Privacy, Nintendo and origins: What you might not have known about Pokemon Go. https://t.co/nGPpvi7jAl— smh.com.au (@smh) July 12, 2016 9. It can cause injuries Reports and photos have surfaced of battered and bruised Pokefans after a night on the hunt. One Pokemon GO Reddit user confessed that: "Pokemon Go put me in the ER last night.” Soon come all of the #PokemonGO injuries! 'I can't come into work today I have a brokemon foot' pic.twitter.com/GADvtCjyot— Daniel Franzese (@WhatsupDanny) July 12, 2016 Another posted: “Not even 30 minutes after the release last night, I slipped and fell down a ditch. Fractured the fifth metatarsal bone in my foot, 6-8 weeks for recovery. I told all the doctors I was walking my dog lol... Watch where you're going, folks!” Other have posted that they too have had near misses or scrapes and bruises from chasing Pokemon into ditches or the like. Pay attention while you play and do not Pokemon GO and drive. No claims for #PokemonGo injuries in NZ just yet. Don’t be the first! Stay aware & in the game, NZ. pic.twitter.com/VBZ3XJMDkV— ACC New Zealand (@ACCNZ) July 12, 2016 10. There is life outside the game There is a life outside of Pokemon GO. Shocking, I know. But it does exist and you used to exist in it as well – before Pokemon GO. Your quest to become the very best that no one ever was doesn’t have to be a lonely one. Organise group walks with friends, join a team with workmates or have real life meet-ups at your local virtual gym. Pokemon GO doesn’t have to take over your life, not in a bad way, use it to make friends, take in your surrounds and learn about the history of your town.

It will take up to 28 months to complete and will be delivered two years later than expected. The company joins Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which have already built data centres here. The centre will help run online services including the iTunes store, App store and Siri. An Bord Pleanála granted permission for the massive development on a 197-hectare site owned by State forestry company Coillte, despite some objections. Coillte refused to state how much the land was sold for, while Apple could not be reached for comment. Among the reasons why the project was approved included the "projected demand" for data storage in the future, coupled with the "economic and operational rationale for the clustering of data storage capacity on one site," the board said. It also noted the difficulties in identifying suitable sites required for the massive developments, which must be linked to the national grid. An electricity sub-station was also approved. OPW Minister Sean Canney said the permission was "fantastic" news for Galway. "The Atlantic economic corridor is a vision for balanced development of the country, and this makes a statement about the west of Ireland," he said. Independent TD Noel Grealish said he had been "assured" by Apple executives that building work would commence shortly. The Galway Chamber said it would provide a welcome boost to the local economy. The plans were approved by Galway County Council in September last year, but appealed to the board following a number of objections. Among the concerns included flooding fears, energy usage, environmental and climate change impact and wildlife issues. The decision can be appealed to the High Court, but only on a point of law. In its decision, the board said the development would not have a "significant effect" on protected nature sites, and that the effects of the proposal had been properly addressed. "The proposed development would, therefore, be in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area," it said in its decision. The data centre will be powered by renewable energy, but 18 diesel generators will be available in the event of a power shortage. Work on the electricity sub-station will take place while the centre is under construction. The decision is subject to 20 conditions, including a reduction in the number of car parking spaces, and plans for an amenity walkway, open to the public, must also be agreed with the local authority. Up to 300 people will be employed during construction, and 150 after.

Whether on the web or via Android, if users receive a message that can’t be authenticated with either the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or DKIM, they’ll see a question mark in place of the sender’s profile photo, corporate logo or avatar. And on the web, if a user receives a message with a link to a dangerous site known for phishing, malware or potentially unwanted software, Gmail will pop up a warning if the user clicks on it.   “These warnings are an extension of the Safe Browsing protection available to various web browsers today,” the company explained, in a blog post. “Not all affected email will necessarily be dangerous. But we encourage you to be extra careful about replying to, or clicking on links in messages that you’re not sure about. And with these updates, you’ll have the tools to make these kinds of decisions.” Google is gradually rolling out the update over the next couple of weeks, with the target of including all users in the scheme. This is the latest improvement to protect users against malware, phishing, ransomware encryption and unwanted or deceptive software with revamped warnings. And, it recently updated its Safe Browsing alerts to include warnings about deceptive embedded content and messages for administrators about unwanted and malicious software. Google has also embraced DMARC, announcing that it will be moving Gmail to a strict DMARC policy this year. The idea is to thwart cyber-criminals who hack into user accounts and then scrape the address books; they then use a different server to spoof messages from the hacked user to his or her own contacts. They do this for spam and fraud purposes, for phishing and to spread malware. A DMARC policy combats this by allowing a sender to indicate that its emails are protected, and tells a receiver what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes—such as junk or reject the message.
