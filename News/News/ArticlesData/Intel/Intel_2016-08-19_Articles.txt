The IDF 2016 dev conference in San Francisco included brand new technology such as virtual reality (VR) headsets, robots, drones, Raspberry Pi-like mini computers, 5G networks, and even DJ tables. It was also a big surprise when the chip maker announced it is willing to build custom ARM chips that could be used in mobile devices.   Advertisement Like Us on Facebook This year's three-day event started on August 16, Tuesday. The first day's keynote featured a wireless VR headset developed by Intel and Microsoft. Project Alloy combines the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets with Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality (AR) headset. The device's RealSense 3D cameras show real-world objects in a virtual world. Intel will open-source the VR headset's design in mid-2017. The chip giant also announced that it is willing to build custom chips with ARM-based designs, according to PCWorld. This shows that the company has dropped x86-based mobile chips. Intel also introduced its development kit for drones called Project Aero. The dev kit includes a flight controller, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communications, and RealSense camera. Project Aero can be pre-ordered for $400 although Intel CEO Brian Krzanich did not announce a shipping date.    Intel also showed off the benefits of USB-C digital audio over 3.5mm headphone jacks. Apple has reportedly removed the analog port from iPhone 7 devices likely to launch next month. The tech company also wants to turn entire smart homes into Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small sensors would be added to the building's infrastructure including beams and foundations.   Intel also unveiled its future plans for self-driving cars. Intel is teaming up with automakers such as Germany's BMW and China's Baidu to develop on-board systems and data centers so cars and trucks can navigate together. The Silicon Valley company augurs that 120 million cars on the road will have some kind of autonomous vehicle (AV) tech by 2030. It wants to launch the first version of its driverless car platform by 2021.   In related news, a block away from the IDF conference Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced that its Zen processor exists and is set to ship early next year, according to Engadget. The target market of AMD's last few chips were budget builders yet the new processor is designed for state-of-the-art PC gaming. AMD's chips have already powered gaming consoles including Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. They are also included in the new Xbox One S and future Project Scorpio.   Here's Intel's AR/VR headset:   Advertisement Tags:intel vr headset intel drone intel processors idf 2016 intel atom chip new intel chip Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

(Seeking Alpha) Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymore was impressed with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) after visiting the company's Developer Forum. The analyst believes Intel is making the right moves to transform the company beyond PCs. "For the second consecutive year, we came away from INTC's Developer Forum (IDF) impressed by INTC's commitment to moving beyond its PC heritage into a wide array of new markets (Networking, AI, Autonomous Driving, IoT, etc.)," stated Seymore. Well Suited To Accelerate Growth The analyst believes Intel's scale of manufacturing and research and development leaves the company well suited for success in this transition, which will become increasingly visible in 2017 as PC-based revenues are expected to fall about 50 percent in terms of the company's total revenue mix. Related Link: Risks To Intel's Estimates Are Increasing As a result of Intel's efforts, Seymore is confident in the company's ability to accelerate growth through its new product lines.

It's based on the Magenta kernel, which is designed for embedded devices, mobile devices, and desktop computers. Tech blog Android Police thinks "it will have potential applications in the Internet of Things." You can find Fuchsia on GitHub. An interesting detail on Fuchsia, covered by the Inquirer, is that it will run on 64-bit ARM chips and Intel-based systems. And is also expected soon for the Raspberry Pi 3. "The key message here is universality. This could be an all-in-one solution." Intel's Alloy, the first open source HoloLens Intel will be the first third-party hardware developer to bring a HoloLens VR device to Windows 10. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced Project Alloy at Intel's Developer Forum in San Francisco last Tuesday. Intel plans to open source the hardware and provide open APIs, allowing everybody to create their own branded products. Linux kernel 4.7 first point release This week, kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the first point release for Linux kernel 7.4, version 4.7.1. This comes a month after Linus Torvalds announced 4.7. With version 4.7.1., the kernel will move from the maintenance channel to stable. This release includes enhancements to ARM, MIPS, and x86 hardware architectures, as well as a variety of fixes for the EXT4 and FUSE filesystems. Greg Kroah-Hartman also announced the 4.6.7 kernel, the last of the 4.6 kernel to be released. He urged users to move to 4.7.1. Microsoft open sources PowerShell Microsoft announced it is open sourcing PowerShell, bringing it to Linux and OS X.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 20, 2016 at 1:23PM Image source: Intel.  At its annual developer forum, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked about its next-generation Atom processor core, code-named Goldmont. Although the Atom family had primarily been interesting to investors because it was at the heart of the company's (failed) mobile applications processor efforts, the cores are still useful in a number of different markets including the Internet of Things, low-end networking processors, and even low-cost personal computers. To that end, it's important that the company keep making significant performance and power enhancements to its Atom processor cores. Intel's 2013 Atom core, Silvermont, was a significant improvement over its prior-generation Atom core, and allowed the company to build credible offerings in a number of segments. The company's 2014-2015 Atom core, code-named Airmont, was a very modest improvement over Silvermont. However, it looks as though with this year's Goldmont core, the company is bringing some hefty performance enhancements to the table. Massive jump in per-core performance Here is a slide illustrating the performance and power of the prior-generation Airmont core and upcoming Goldmont core in SPECint_base2000 (once an industry-standard test of CPU performance): Image source: Intel. According to the slide, a Goldmont core running at 2.4GHz offers 56% more performance than an Airmont core running at 2.24GHz. A quad-core Goldmont with all cores at 2.2GHz also offers 56% more performance than a quad-core Airmont running at 2.24GHz. This means that, at least in SPECint_2000, Goldmont is substantially faster than Airmont, implying that the new core is substantially enhanced from the prior-generation core. Looks good, but Intel can't let up The main problem with Atom processor cores is simply that Intel doesn't release chips in a timely fashion. Products based on the Goldmont CPU core were originally supposed to come out in the 2015 time frame, targeting smartphones, tablets, and low-cost PCs. Intel's Atom-based networking chips have also been neglected, with its current product line still based on the Silvermont architecture manufactured in the company's 22-nanometer process. Intel should be able to assemble system-on-a-chip products, which integrate CPU cores and other components to make a complete product, in a more rapid fashion. Clearly there is some issue within the company that it needs to remedy. What I would like to see is the company releasing products based on successive Atom cores at a yearly clip. That means products based on the post-Goldmont Atom in the second half of 2017, products based on the successor to that in the second half of 2018, and so on. If Intel can do that, then the company's businesses that rely on the Atom core should be in pretty good shape, particularly if the company continues to make significant generation-over-generation strides in core performance. However, if the company's product releases continue to be as unpredictable as they have been over the last couple of generations, then it may be difficult for those businesses to achieve the growth and profitability that the company hopes.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Project Alloy Is A Wireless VR Headset By Intel Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:20am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 22 2016, 9:08pm CDT, in News | Technology News     Project Alloy is the new VR headset that Intel has been working on. This particular VR technology is wireless and has its own personal battery and processor. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Alloy is pretty cool as it locates rooms for you and keeps a track of your fingers so that you can interact with virtual objects. The camera which is part of Intel’s push around “merged reality” that lets you experience VR and augmented reality as a single unit allows you to see other objects as well as people around you. This former mentioned concept is similar to Microsoft’s "mixed reality" with HoloLens. This Holographic platform owned by Microsoft will assume an important position with the Alloy hardware. The Holographic platform will be accessible to all Windows 10 PCs from next year and Intel’s Alloy hardware specifications and APIs will become an open source from next year. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel made the following statement at the IDF keynote today, “"Anyone can take Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class VR system.” A demo was given by a rep from Intel to showcase the Project Alloy headset. Whilst wearing this headset he was able to navigate through a virtual room while simultaneously move around on the stage. Although the headset took a few minutes to recognize the rep’s hand it was impressively able to do so when the rep made the move to a door in VR. This project by Alloys is significant when it comes to the future of VR as well as AR. This is the first set of technology that is not limited to the fact that it has to be connected to a PC or a phone with pest wires. Intel plans on pushing the boundaries of wireless VR with Project alloy.

Intel officials are ready to bring silicon photonics—in development for 16 years—to the market. At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) this week, Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the company's Data Center Group, announced that the chip maker has begun shipping silicon photonics modules, the first products in an expected portfolio that officials have said will help meet the growing demand from cloud service providers for more network bandwidth, better scalability and faster connectivity. Silicon photonics refers to the use of pulses of light rather than electrical signals over copper wires to move large amounts of data at high speeds and over long distances. Intel's first two products, the 100G PSM4 (Parallel Single Mode fiber 4-lane) and 100G CWDM4 (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 4-lane), will target switch-to-switch optical interconnects in data centers and will be available later this year, with adoption ramping next year. The first silicon photonics-based components will enable the transfer of data at 100 gigabits per second over distances of 2km or more, and will come in a pluggable model and an embedded form factor. Silicon photonics not only will use light to offer faster connectivity, but Intel's technology also uses silicon lithography to more precisely align the laser, all of which will lead to greater performance, better efficiency and lower costs, officials said. The technology will enable organizations to move beyond the scaling and distance limitations of copper wire for transferring data between data centers and within systems, all at lower cost and greater efficiency, Bryant said during her keynote address at the show. Intel plans to increase the speed between network switches to 400g bps, and officials eventually want to bring optical communications onto the chip, driving at faster connectivity for inside the server. Intel, which has been shipping the modules since June, is the first step with silicon photonics for helping cloud service providers deal with the rapid growth in data center traffic. According to Bryant, network traffic in the data center is five times that of internet traffic every year, and the amount of traffic is doubling every year. A change is needed, she said. "Electrons running over network cables won't cut it," Bryant said. "We see a future where silicon photonics optical input-output is everywhere in the data center." Microsoft is an early adopter of Intel's silicon photonics, with officials planning on using it in its Azure cloud data centers. Kushagra Vaid, general manager of Azure cloud hardware engineering at the software giant, joined Bryant on stage. Vaid said the growth of data traffic in cloud data centers calls for new technologies that can scale better than copper. "It's a great way to continue that scaling, to use silicon photonics," he said. The plan is initially to deploy the technology in Azure for switch-to-switch connectivity, Vaid said. Intel isn't the only tech company pursuing silicon photonics. IBM engineers a year ago announced they had designed and tested a fully integrated wavelength multiplexed silicon photonics chip, which officials said was a key step to developing 100g-bps optical transceivers. IBM's silicon photonics research is part of a $3 billion effort announced in 2014 to research technologies that will replace traditional silicon chip architectures.             LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Microsoft Plans to Build a Quantum Computer Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

But are any worth buying today? Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Aug 20, 2016 at 9:08AM Image source: Getty Images. Income investors broadly aim to buy above-average dividends that boast market-beating stock-price growth, as well. That's a tall order, because high-dividend payouts often come shackled to shares that have declined sharply -- often due to underlying business difficulties in stodgy, slow-moving industries.  To combat these natural difficulties, the technology sector just might offer the right mix of growth, dynamism, and dividend yield to be worthy of investor's attention. Below, we'll look at the top-dividend stocks in the technology sector with an eye toward finding the ones that could provide that elusive mix of hefty cash returns and capital appreciation. Highest dividend-paying technology stocks Stock Dividend yield Payout ratio Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 8.7% N/A Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) 4.5% 56% AT&T (NYSE:T) 4.4% 82% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 4.2% 64% HP (NYSE:HPQ) 3.5% 25% IBM (NYSE:IBM) 3.5% 43% Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) 3.4% 57% Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) 3.4% 44% Xerox (NYSE:XRX) 3.2% 74% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 3% 48% Source:Yahoo Finance. Sustainable dividend A high dividend won't do you any good if it isn't also growing over time, so we can screen out dividends that aren't well covered by current earnings and cash flow. In Frontier's case, for example, the communications giant booked a net loss in its last fiscal year and for the first quarter of 2016. Sure, free cash flow is about twice the $125 million it pays out each quarter in dividends. However, Frontier's large debt load and costly expansion plans means that there are more-important priorities than boosting an already-generous payout. INTC Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Consider IBM as a stronger dividend-growth candidate. Its $1.3 billion quarterly payout was less than half of its (substantial) earnings last quarter, and just one-third of its operating cash flow. Big Blue's debt level, meanwhile, is less than twice its cash on hand. The consistently improving cash production has helped the dividend double since 2010, even as the payout ratio remains below 50% of earnings . Solid market outlook Intel stands out in this list as a dividend tech giant with solid growth prospects. Despite weakness in the PC market, Intel's management sees an acceleration in sales gains this year thanks to healthy demand in its data center, programmable solutions, and Internet of Things divisions. Profitability is also running ahead of plan thanks to falling production costs. Image source: Getty Images. Unfortunately, restructuring expenses will continue to pinch short-term profits. Yet Intel appears set to emerge from its transition in fine shape to take advantage of major tech trends like cloud computing and big data. Contrast that outlook with hard-drive giant Western Digital, whose stock has slumped by 40% in the last year as sales volume and profitability dropped. Like Frontier, WDC is hoping a major acquisition will help it right the ship, but sustainable dividend growth won't be possible until sales and earnings recover. Finding a good value Thanks to their relatively slow growth and spotty recent financial performance, nearly all of these tech stocks can be purchased at a discount to the broader stock market. Newly formed HP is the cheapest of the group at nine times forward earnings, while Qualcomm weighs in as the priciest, at 16 times next-year's profits. Investors are paying about 19 times forward earnings, meanwhile, for the S&P 500. All of the above stocks also pay an annual yield that's at least 50% higher than the S&P's current 2%.  Of course, the valuation and income gaps alone don't make these dividend stocks screaming buys. But they do suggest that income investors could find some solid long-term bets among mature dividend tech giants right now. With that in mind, I'm most interested in Intel at today's prices. The chip titan's cash flow and profits seem to have stabilized and are primed for steady growth even if the PC market stays weak, which means its dividend has room to improve from its already market-thumping 3% yield.  Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The 3.5mm audio jack, which was introduced as a way to connect headphones into an audio player is poised to be replaced by USB-C port. Most smartphones and high end laptops have transitioned from microUSB to USB-C as the primary port of interface and the reversible USB port is now aiming to kill the well known audio jack. At IDF, Intel has announced new USB audio standard that will push 3.5mm audio out of the smartphone industry. The first problem with USB-C port replacing the headphone jack is the countless number of headphones people own right now and ones that are lying in the inventory. The second problem being that while listening to music with a USB-C based headphone, it will become impossible to charge the device and vice-versa. Intel says its new USB audio standard will ensure efficient battery consumption and also define new mechanism for buttons to pause music or lower volume, reports CNET.

Miller August 19, 2016 10 Comments AMD showed good signs that it could again be a real competitor in processors for high-performance PCs and servers. In announcing the first details of its Zen architecture, and showing off the first products based on the design yesterday, AMD showed signs that it could again be a real competitor in processors for high-performance PCs and servers. That will be good news for buyers of both PCs and servers because Intel now thoroughly dominates both markets, and while Intel makes some great processors, more competition typically results in better products or at least better prices. Although AMD was once a big player in both of these markets and can claim many firsts—its Opteron server products were the first to go 64-bit—it's been years since AMD really had competitive products. The "Bulldozer" architecture and its successors just didn't deliver the performance the company wanted or needed compared with Intel's offerings. At a press conference announcing Zen held during the annual Intel Developer Forum this week, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that "AMD is at its best as a high-performance computing company." She also said that work on the Zen architecture goes back two years, to the beginning of her time as CEO. AMD SVP and CTO Mark Papermaster showed some details of the Zen microarchitecture, saying it was a "ground-up" new design architecture that can stretch from PCs to servers to mobile. He said Zen was designed for performance, throughput, and efficiency, which sounds good but not unique, and it's the details that matter. On that subject, Papermaster talked about how the new architecture provides a 40 percent improvement in performance per clock at the same energy compared to AMD's existing architecture, and with more parallelism, including 75 percent more scheduling capacity and 50 percent more instruction width. He said Zen has better branch prediction, as well as a micro-op cache. Perhaps the biggest departure is the addition of symmetric multitasking (SMT)—the ability to run two threads per core. In its previous architecture, AMD went for more integer calls, while Intel instead focused on its version of SMT, which it calls hyperthreading. Papermaster said additional details would be revealed at next week's Hot Chips conference. The new products will be produced on Global Foundries' 14nm FinFET process, which Papermaster said allows for improvements in performance per watt, making it more suitable for mobile processors. AMD is currently using this process on its Polaris Radeon Graphics GPUs. This first product, code-named Summit Ridge, will be an 8-core, 16-thread processor aimed at the desktop enthusiast market, Su said. This will support the AM4 socket the company plans to roll out with its next APU this fall, called "Bristol Ridge" (based on the older architecture). It supports DDR4 memory, PCIe 3.0, and next generation I/O, such as USB 3.1 and NVMe. The Summit Ridge chip is now expected to ship in volume in the first quarter of 2017, a bit later than some had hoped. In demonstrations, it appeared to do a fine job playing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided at 4K using a Radeon Fury X graphics board. AMD compared it with an 8-core, 16-thread Intel Core i7-6900K (Broadwell-E) at 3 GHz, showing it completing the Blender rendering test just slightly faster. As usual, I take all vendor benchmarks with a grain of salt; AMD has worked on the Blender benchmark to make it work better with Open CL on discrete GPUs, so it's unclear whether this is a representative test. Also note that Broadwell-E typically runs at 3.2 GHz with turbo up to 3.7 GHz, so AMD slowed it down for the test; it is also available in a 10-core, 20-thread version. That said, it does indicate that Zen should at least be competitive. Perhaps more importantly, the company announced a server processor, known as Naples, that will have up to 32-cores and 64-thread, designed for the standard 2-processor server market. AMD showed off a motherboard of such a system and had it running in one of the demos, though it was not running any real applications. This is supposed to be out in the second quarter of 2017. AMD said it now had "hundreds" of such servers in its labs and with software partners. Su said entry into the server market was not about a "point product," but about being competitive for the next five years. This seems important given how Intel has completely dominated the server market in recent years, with a market share well above 95 percent. Naples seems aimed squarely at the Xeon E5 and standard 2P servers, the kind of server that most businesses use for their everyday computing. It's not necessarily the most exciting part of the market, but it is the broadest, and one where there is room for competition. In the second half of next year, AMD plans to have an APU (integrated CPU and graphics) version designed for notebooks, with embedded products to follow. In short, the Zen products look competitive from a performance viewpoint; that's something AMD has not been able to claim about its CPUs in recent years. Of course, there's still a lot we don't know, including details about actual shipping versions of the chips, with things such as frequency, memory specifications, or Total Desktop Power (TDP). It's highly likely there will be versions of these chips with fewer cores, though AMD has not shared any details. The company hasn't announced pricing. Still, I'm always a fan of competition, and Zen represents AMD's best shot in years at giving Intel some real competition in the desktop and notebook markets, and particularly in the server market. "We are back," said an exuberant Su, and that's something that should be good for all of us who buy x86 processors. Back to top By Michael J. Miller Michael J.

Slideshow 19 Views of IDF16 PC giant aims to play a new tune Rick Merritt 8/19/2016 07:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO – Whether Intel can remain the world’s largest semiconductor company in the wake of the PC tsunami is anyone’s guess. But there’s no doubt the company is trying to move fast on multiple fronts to participate in a richly diverse set of opportunities ahead. This year’s Intel Develop Forum showed the company racing to get traction with a broad set of new platforms in machine vision, the Internet of Things, FPGAs, machine learning and more. None of them will replace the PC, but some collection of them could someday more than fill that gap. Analysts’ opinions were mixed. In a research note entitled, “Battleship is turning,” Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank said he was “impressed by Intel’s commitment to move beyond its PC heritage into a wide array of new markets … this transition will become increasingly apparent in 2017 as PC-related revs fall to ~50% of the company's mix. He and others praised the company for an update on its 10nm node that showed “its ability to keep pace with Moore’s law when others have found doing so more difficult.” Semiconductor analyst Mathew Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity added that Intel’s willingness to embrace ARM cores in its foundry and FPGA offerings a “refreshing relatively new sense of market pragmatism from CEO Brian Krzanich.” Market watcher Nathan Brookwood of Insight64 was less sanguine noting that the PC was probably was “the most important design win of all time…but it’s not clear IoT will be the same horn of plenty…I think ARM is going to be the long term winner in IoT,” he added. The three-day event began with a high octane band playing on virtual instruments using armbands powered by Intel Curie IoT modules, including a virtual keyboard played with gloves using its RealSense depth cameras (below). Among the many new platforms Intel is pursuing, RealSense is a clear star candidate. Next page: A depth camera with breadth (All Images by EE Times except where noted.)

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware AMD’s Zen Outperforms Intel’s $1000 i7 6900K In Its First Ever Demo – Zen Architecture Detailed By Khalid Moammer Posted Aug 18, 2016 1.1kShares Share Tweet Submit This is the moment that all PC hardware enthusiasts have eagerly awaited for nearly half a decade. AMD today has officially pulled back the covers on its brand new high performance Zen CPU microarchitecture, its features, specs and most importantly performance. That’s right, this is the very first time that the company has actually demonstrated the performance of Zen directly against its competition from Intel. This all took place in a private media event that the company held in San Francisco. At which AMD’s President & CEO Lisa Su took the stage alongside Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster to talk all about Zen.  So what exactly did they have to say? to summarize it in two words, a LOT! Zen, AMD’s Most Important Product In More Than A Decade Many Years In The making Zen has been one of AMD’s most eagerly anticipated products for as far as I can remember. It’s the company’s first attempt to compete at the high-end, enthusiast, CPU market since the introduction of the Bulldozer microarchitecture five years ago. Zen breaks new ground for AMD in many ways. It’s the company’s first ever CPU architecture to feature simultaneous multithreading. It’s also the very first product for AMD to be built on a process technology that’s very close to parity with Intel since the days of the original Athlon more than a decade ago. This fact alone is huge. It means that for the very first time since the early 2000s AMD’s CPU products won’t be at an inherent disadvantage due to Intel’s process lead. From an architectural point of view Zen is a brand new clean-slate design that’s been led from the get-go by accomplished CPU architect Jim Keller. The very same engineer that played a pivotal role in designing the original Athlon XP and Athlon64 processors. The most competitive CPU products in the history of the company. Zen is AMD’s biggest long-term technology bet and one of the company’s largest engineering efforts undertaken by the company. President & CEO Lisa Su stated that this year’s products, culminated in Zen and Polaris, represent company’s most competitive roadmap in more than a decade. AMD President & CEO Lisa Su – Q4 2015 Earnings Call “We remain focused on completing our strategic work around three key growth pillars. First, in PCs, even in a declining overall market, we believe we can regain client compute and discrete graphics share for the year, driven by gaming, VR, commercial, and our most competitive product roadmap in more than a decade. We have clear opportunities to regain GPU share in 2016 based on the performance per watt of our new GPUs and software leadership. Earlier this quarter at CES, we announced our new Polaris GPU architecture, which we expect to begin shipping in the middle of 2016.” The microarchitecture taped out back in 2015 and is already sampling. Consumer based desktop products are on track to be available en mass in 2017. However, we know that AMD is working on far more than just high performance desktop CPUs. The company has had 32 Core Zen server CPU, a sixteen core Zen HPC APU and a quadcore Zen consumer APU all in the works for several years. The Zen Microarchitecture Below we have a visual representation of Zen’s high-level design from AMD. Interestingly enough it looks very much like our very own in-house diagram that we had published last year.  The integer cluster in each Zen core has six pipes, four ALUs, Arhithmatic Logic Units, and two AGUs which is short for Address Generation Units. These AGUs can perform two 16-byte loads and oine 16-byte store per cycle via a 32 KB 8-way set associative write-back L1 data cache. According to AMD the move from a write-through to a write-back cache has noticeably reduced stalls in several types of code paths. The load/store cache operations cache in Zen also reportedly exhibit lower latency compared to Excavator. AMD Zen Benchmarks Leaked - 8 & 4 Core CPUs with 16 & 8 Threads Confirmed, Rated At 95W & 65W TDP The floating point unit is capable of performing two FMAC operations or a single 256-bit AVX operation per cycle. Exactly as we had detailed in our exclusive architectural deep-dive last year funnily enough. AMD’s First Microarchitecture To Feature Simulataneous Multithreading AMD has done away with the CMT – clustered multi-threading – concept that was introduced with the Bulldozer family of cores in 2011 in favor of a more traditional SMT – sumultaneous multi-threading – design. This means that each Zen core will be able to execute two threads simultaneously. A principal very high throughput thread and a secondary thread that can be used opportunistically. In contrast, each Bulldozer module can execute two identical threads. This is achieved through two separate integer clusters with a single front-end. This approach saves area versus building two separate cores and delivers two high throughput threads. However, there are advantages that Zen’s SMT implementation holds over the Bulldozer CMT implementation.  For one it allows AMD to build a single larger integer cluster with significantly higher single threaded performance. Another advantage with this approach is that it leaves a lot of wiggle room for clever savings in area and power. A Drive For Power Efficiency CPU Microarchitecture AMD Phenom II / K10 AMD BD/PD AMD SR/XV AMD Zen Intel Skylake Instruction Decode Width 3-wide 4-wide 8-wide 4-wide 4-wide Single Core Peak Decode Rate 3 instructions 4 instructions 8 instructions 4 instructions 4 instructions Dual Core Peak Decode Rate 6 instructions 4 instructions 8 instructions 8 instructions 8 instructions A lot of the engineering effort around Zen has also been done to address one of Bulldozer’s major flaws. Bulldozer and Intel’s Sandy Bridge – and subsqeuent Intel architectures including Skylake – had equally deep pipelines to achieve high clock speeds. The deeper the pipeline the more latency that the design will exhibit. Particularly when it comes to branch misprediction errors, which are quite common in such pipelines. The latency that results from branch mispredicts are quite significant. To combat this issue Intel introduced a micro-op cache with Sandy Bridge. It worked to a great extent in reducing mispredict penalties and was believed to be the principle reason behind Sandy Bridge’s significant single threaded performance advantage over Bulldozer. The good news is that AMD has confirmed that it’s finally introducing its own micro-op cache with Zen. Another thing that we had pointed out in our architectural deep dive on Zen last year. On the front-end each Zen core is capable of decoding four instructions per cycle, which are fed to the operations queue. The micro-op cache along with the queue have a throughput of six operations per cycle going into the schedulers. Advertisement The final result is similar overall throughput when we look at both treads of each SMT core vs both threads in each CMT core. This evidenced by the leaked Zen benchmarks that we’ve seen recently. However, Zen delivers significantly higher single threaded performance. Furthermore, because each Bulldozer module houses two integer clusters and a single floating point unit it was always very integer heavy. Each Zen core on the other hand includes one large integer cluster and one large floating point unit making it a much more balanced design. The Zen Microarchitecture In A Nutshell AMD’s brand new Zen core features a significantly wider execution engine than anything we’ve seen before from the company. Leveraging simultaneous multi threading and a micro-op queue to boost throughput and single threaded performance.  This combined with a brand new, low latency cache sub-system and a new set of pre-fetch algorithms result in a dramatic instruction per clock improvement and doubling of throughput per core compared to AMD’s previous 8 Piledriver FX 8300 series CPUs. AMD Celebrates Radeon Technologies Group's First Year Aiming For The Stars High Level View: Two threads per core 8 MB shared L3 cache Large, unified L2 cache Micro-op Cache Two AES units for security 14nm FinFET Transistors AMD : Zen Outperforms Intel’s High-End Broadwell-E CPUs Zen Performance Demo vs Intel’s $1000 Broadwell-E i7 6900X During the event AMD treated the audience to the very first public, real-world performance showdown featuring Zen and a contemporary competing Intel high-end enthusiast class CPU. The demo involved two similarly specced PCs one configured with an eight core, 16 thread Zen engineering sample clocked at 3.0Ghz and the other configured a with an eight core, 16 thread Intel Broadwell-E processor also clocked at 3.0Ghz. Both systems started the same Blender render session at the same time and the Zen CPU was actually able to finish first. This marks the very first time that we have seen an AMD CPU outshine an Intel CPU in instructions per clock in more than a decade. Outperforming the Intel CPU core for core, and clock for clock. That demo represents a truly historic moment for AMD. The key takeaways here are – Zen has better or equivalent IPC to Intel’s highest performing desktop CPUs yet, Broadwell-E. – AMD states that 8 core, 16 thread Zen CPUs will scale to frequencies beyond 3.0Ghz. All New AM4 Socket & Platform AMD is finally bringing all of its desktop products under one roof. The next generation AM4 socket will be compatibel with both desktop APUs and CPUs. This includes the upcoming Excavator based Bristol Ridge APUs which are set to arrive some time during the next four months. As well as the brand new Summit Ridge family of high-performance Zen CPUs. All CPUs inside the Summit Ridge family will include the company’s new platform security processor, PCIe 3.0 support, dual channel DDR4 memory controllers, copious amounts of L3 cache and updated storage features. Including USB3.1 and NVMe. AMD AM4 platform key technology features include: DDR4 Memory PCIe Gen 3 USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps NVMe SATA Express Availablity & Closing Comments AMD confirmed that AM4 motherboards will begin shipping throughout the next number of months. The first processors to be available on the new socket are Bristol Ridge APUs, which will begin shipping some time before the Holiday season. The multi-core enthusiast Zen CPUs that have been the subject of most of this article will be available en mass in early 2017 CEO Lisa Su has confirmed. There were some hints that Zen could launch around CES, so January 2017 would be a good bet. It seems that all the stars are lining up for AMD, which has seen its fair share of struggles over the past several years. All the components are there to make Zen a successful product.  It has taken more than a decade, but it’s finally here. An AMD product that can actually challenge Intel’s highest performing Extreme Edition CPUs. It’s almost unfathomable at first thought, after all we all grew accustomed to seeing Intel’s enthusiast CPUs go uncontested for the longest time. Bringing this to a close, it’s clear that AMD’s is doing a lot of things right with Zen. Pushing IPC and power efficiency to where they need to be. Building a comprehensive modern platform and bringing much needed updates to the feature-set. Creating an attractive value proposition for desktop users, servers and notebooks. All the ingredients to make Zen a success are here, all that’s left is for AMD to execute and deliver. The mere prospect that enthusiasts may actually have AMD CPUs as a worthwile option again for the first time in a decade come this October is refreshing. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll finally be able to say “AMD’s back”.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Intel & ARM Announce Historic Licensing Deal; Santa Clara To Also Manufacture 10nm Chips For LG By Ramish Zafar Posted Aug 17, 2016 121Shares Share Tweet Submit Even as Intel dominates in the personal computing space, the company’s yet to make its mark in mobile. Qualcomm and Samsung have dominated this sphere consistently. Despite its advanced manufacturing processes, Intel’s yet to churn out a top tier, long lasting flagship mobile processor. However, that just might change soon. The company’s looking to make some big changes to its semiconductor platform. Intel, will now manufacture chips for other companies such as ARM. To be more precise, it will be licensing technology from Britain’s ARM holdings. This will increase the company’s presence in the mobile sphere significantly. Intel To License ARM’s Chip Licenses To Increase Presence In Mobile Sphere When it comes to processors, there’s no one out there who understands silicon like Intel does. The US company’s stable and dominating presence in personal computing is out there for everyone to witness. However, it’s still manged to fail to translate this in the mobile sphere, where even a fraction of Intel’s modems making it on the iPhone make for big news. However, the company’s fortunes look to change soon. In a historic announcement today, Intel has announced that it will be licensing British design house ARM’s chip designs. In lay man terms, it means that ARM will now be using Intel’s foundries for its chio manufacturing purposes. The announcement was made by the pair at the Intel Developer Forum taking place in San Francisco, California. Advertisement After all, as Moore’s Law comes to an end, Intel’s going to need other avenues for growth. With the server market also slowing down, outsourcing its facilities to other tech houses does seem to be the right move. As Santa Clara starts to manufacture ARM chips, its presence in mobile devices will increase exponentially. However, these won’t be Intel’s own designs – a fact which will take some time to change. Still, it’s a big win for Intel and the company should undoubtedly find new areas for growth after today’s announcement. Intel 200-Series (Z270/H270) Chipset Platform Detailed - Kaby Lake and Skylake Processors To Work On Both 200 and 100 Series Boards Intel’s liason with ARM isn’t the company’s only big mobile news today. We’ve been hearing for quite a while about LG Inc.’s mobile processor. This has been rumored in conjunction with Santa Clara and today, you can confirm these rumors. In a blog post Intel announced that LG will be using its 10nm foundry to manufacture various mobile components. LG’s been stepping up its mobile game for quite a while and increased self sufficiency in this end will help the Korean manufacturer by quite a bit. Thoughts?

 Intel has introduced a ready-to-fly drone BI Intelligence Aug. 19, 2016, 1:24 PM 3,948 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Autonomous aircraft could soon fight forest fires Amazon Echo owners can now send texts with AT&T The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. At its annual developers conference, Intel released a drone that developers can implement their software on, Engadget is reporting. In some ways, the drone is like a developer board (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.). While the tech giant did not set a timetable for the release of the drone or a sale price, the company did confirm that it will be made available by the end of 2016. The drone, called Aero, is specifically designed for developers who want to develop and test applications for drones. Aero is powered through an Atom processor and comes with Intel’s RealSense camera for navigation purposes, and the drone comes with cameras powered by Ambarella, the same company who makes GoPro cameras, according to TechCrunch. Additionally, the drone comes pre-loaded with AirMap — an app that helps drone users determine where it is safe and legal to fly a drone. Intel has made equity investments in several drone startups, while AirMap has partnered with drone makers DJI and 3D Robotics.  Drones turned the corner in 2015 to become a popular consumer device, while a framework for regulation that legitimizes drones in the US began to take shape. Technological and regulatory barriers still exist to further drone adoption. Drone manufacturers and software providers are quickly developing technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance that will make flying drones safer. The accelerating pace of drone adoption is also pushing governments to create new regulations that balance safety and innovation. Safer technology and better regulation will open up new applications for drones in the commercial sector, including drone delivery programs like Amazon’s Prime Air and Google’s Project Wing initiatives. Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed drones report that forecasts sales revenues for consumer, enterprise, and military drones. It also projects the growth of drone shipments for consumers and enterprises. The report details several of world’s major drone suppliers and examines trends in drone adoption among several leading industries. Finally, it examines the regulatory landscape in several markets and explains how technologies like obstacle avoidance and drone-to-drone communications will impact drone adoption. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: We project revenues from drones sales to top $12 billion in 2021, up from just over $8 billion last year. Shipments of consumer drones will more than quadruple over the next five years, fueled by increasing price competition and new technologies that make flying drones easier for beginners. Growth in the enterprise sector will outpace the consumer sector in both shipments and revenues as regulations open up new use cases in the US and EU, the two biggest potential markets for enterprise drones. Technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance will make flying drones safer and make regulators feel more comfortable with larger numbers of drones taking to the skies. Right now FAA regulations have limited commercial drones to a select few industries and applications like aerial surveying in the agriculture, mining, and oil and gas sectors. The military sector will continue to lead all other sectors in drone spending during our forecast period thanks to the high cost of military drones and the growing number of countries seeking to acquire them. In full, the report: Compares drone adoption across the consumer, enterprise, and government sectors. Breaks down drone regulations across several key markets and explains how they’ve impacted adoption. Discusses popular use cases for drones in the enterprise sector, as well as nascent use case that are on the rise. Analyzes how different drone manufacturers are trying to differentiate their offerings with better hardware and software components. Explains how drone manufacturers are quickly enabling autonomous flight in their products that will be a major boon for drone adoption.

This solution monitors the status of a home’s front door and garage door for increased security. The gateway gathers data from a doorbell, door lock, stepper motors, and a garage door application for edge data analytics. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a smart home vertical rapid path to product edge IoT solution using cloud data analytics, a proof of concept was created using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, and scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, Intel® XDK IoT Edition, and IBM Bluemix* cloud services. This solution monitors the status of a home’s front door and garage door for increased security. The gateway gathers data from a doorbell, door lock, stepper motors, and a garage door application for edge data analytics. The promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to provide connectivity that lets us control and be aware of countless points of presence, everywhere and all the time. As the center of every consumer’s world, the home is possibly the most vital site where this vision is unfolding. In short, when we are away from our homes, we would like to know that they are secure, and technology can play a rich role in making it so. Everyone has had the nagging suspicion that they left the door unlocked or the garage door open, often when it was too late to conveniently double-check. And in a world of instantaneous access to infinite information from anywhere, anytime, that can be hard to take. Many of us are ready to adopt (and pay for) solutions that can remove this annoyance. While many products are available on the general market to enable the smart home, this segment is still in its infancy, and insufficient interoperability exists among products and components from various vendors. Intel has identified value to building solutions using standards-based, open platforms. This approach would allow for a whole- home approach that enables simple implementation of smart devices, with security and monitoring through the cloud. The corresponding commercial potential for these products and services is substantial. Intel undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building systems for the smart home. The project drew inspiration in large part from the existing solution blueprint of the smart home platform from Yoga Systems. This document recounts the course of that project development effort. It begins with an abstract description of a structured project methodology, divided into phases, and then recounts the process of the project’s development in detail, phase by phase. Interested parties can use this narrative to retrace the steps taken by the Intel project team in developing the smart home path to product. Perhaps more importantly, however, it can be generalized as a set of guidelines to address the needs of other types of projects. Intel makes this document freely available and encourages the use of this methodology and process to drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the IoT. This article contains an overview of the IoT Path-to-Product: Smart Home. To see the project tutorial, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build the Smart Home Prototype. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. Methodology By its nature, the IoT embraces open- ended innovation, with an endless diversity of projects to add intelligence to objects from the simple to the complex, and from the mundane to the exotic. At the same time, every project builds on experience the industry has gained from IoT projects that have gone before, and best practices suggest structural elements in common among IoT projects in general. To take advantage of those commonalities and help increase the chances of success during development, Intel has developed a structured approach to IoT project development. This approach consists of a six-phase model that guides the entire path to product, which begins with the first glimmer of an idea and follows through until the final solution is in commercial deployment. The six- phase model is intended to be general enough that it can be adapted to the needs of any IoT project. Initiation Phases (1-3) The first three phases of the project methodology are investigative. They focus on ideation and assessing the potential of the project to solve a given problem, in preparation for ultimately leading to a commercially viable product. As such, these phases value brainstorming and proof of concept over rigorously addressing the finer points of design. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino 101" board. Phase 1 Define the opportunity that the project will take advantage of. The first step of an IoT project is to identify the problem or opportunity that the project will address. Documentation at this stage should identify the opportunity itself, the value of the solution (to end users as well as the organizations that build and implement it), and limitations of the project concept, including design challenges and constraints. Phase 2 Design a proof of concept to take advantage of the opportunity. The initial solution design proposes a practical approach to building the solution, including hardware, software, and network elements. The design must address the design challenges and constraints identified in Phase 1 to the extent that is possible before building a prototype, including due consideration of factors such as cost and security. Phase 3 Build and refine the proof of concept. The solution prototype is based on the design established in Phase 2, making and documenting changes as needed. Design changes based on shortcomings and additional opportunities identified during testing should be documented as part of this phase. Completion Phases (4 – 6) The last three phases of the project methodology proceed only after the decision has been made to go forward with productizing the solution. As such, these phases are explicitly concerned with hardening, in terms of stability, security, and manageability, preparing the product for mass production, and monetizing it to realize its commercial potential. The completion phases of the project involve shifting the solution to industrial-grade sensors and related components, building it out using a commercial-grade gateway, and finalizing the feature set. Phase 4: Produce a solid beta version. Once the project has been approved as a viable solution to develop toward production, the next step is to produce a product-oriented version that is explicitly intended to finalize the design. This version represents a significant investment in resources, including commercial- grade sensors and other components, as well as a commercial IoT gateway. Phase 5 Evaluate functionality and add features. The completed beta version of the solution is tested to verify that it functions correctly according to the design parameters. As part of the testing process, the project team also identifies additional features and functionality, which are incorporated into the solution to make it more robust and valuable to end users. Phase 6 Finalize design and move into production. Once the product is feature-complete, the team hardens the solution by adding advanced manageability and security features, as well as optimizing the design as needed to enhance factors such as marketability and efficiency of manufacturing. The production user interface (UI) for the solution is also finalized. This phase also includes final planning for merchandising and marketing the solution before moving into full production. Phase 1: Defining the Opportunity Sensors to detect the status of a door being locked or unlocked, a doorbell being rung, and a garage door being open or closed provide rudimentary data, but the significance of that data can be profound. The duality between the simplicity of this information and its significance is the basis for the commercial value potential of this solution. The core group of project initiators at Intel determined that a smart home is viable as the basis for a potential project to demonstrate IoT capabilities and the project methodology described here. That core group identified skill sets that were likely to be required during the project, including project management, programming, cloud architecture, and documentation. Based on that list of required skills, the core group formed the full project team, with personnel on the project mostly drawn from Intel employees, with external personnel included in a small number of instances to round out the expertise of the team. The full project team’s first order of business was to quantify the potential opportunity associated with the project, as the basis for the initial prototype design. The core opportunity for this use case was identified as integrating programmatic control and notification associated with certain functions of the smart home, including the following: Front door: The project will lock and unlock the door and provide status about the locked/unlocked state as well as the open/closed state of the door on the physical model. Doorbell: When the doorbell button is pushed on the model, a visual representation will be displayed on the administration application and the mobile application. Garage door: Users can send commands from the mobile application to raise and lower the garage door. The mobile application will also display the door’s progress as it opens or closes and provide an alert if the door is blocked from closing. Sensors will detect and send this information to the cloud to enable logging and analytics, as well as remote secure access so a user can view event notifications and status of the various smart-home elements listed above. The team also identified opportunities to further expand the solution that it designated as being out of scope for this project. These included managed service offerings for both residential and commercial customers, including incorporation into existing solutions to enrich home-security offerings. Phase 2: Designing the Proof-of-Concept Prototype The project team determined that, for this project to be as useful as possible for the developer community, it should be based on readily available parts and technologies. Based on that decision, it was decided to limit the bill of materials to the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, Intel® IoT Developer Kit, and Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633283), using software technologies that are widely used in the industry and available at low or no cost, with the use of free open-source software (FOSS) wherever practical. To accelerate the prototype stage and reduce its complexity, the team elected to build the local portion of the prototype as a bench model that would consist of the compute platform and sensors, without incorporating an actual scale model of a smart home, although such a model would be added at a future stage of the project. Prototype Hardware Selection The Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE small-form-factor PC was chosen for this project. This platform is pictured in Figure 1, and its high-level specifications are given in Table 1. In addition to its robust performance, the team felt that, as Intel’s most recently introduced hardware platform specifically targeting IoT, it was a forward-looking choice for this demonstration project. Based on the Intel® Atom™ processor E3815, the Intel NUC offers a fanless thermal solution, 4 GB of onboard flash storage (and SATA connectivity for additional storage), as well as a wide range of I/O ports. The Intel NUC is conceived as a highly compact and customizable device that provides capabilities at the scale of a desktop PC. To simplify the process of interfacing with sensors, the team elected to take advantage of the Arduino ecosystem using the Arduino 101 board, also shown in Figure 1, with specifications given in Table 1. This board makes the Intel NUC both hardware and pin compatible with Arduino shields, in keeping with the open-source ideals of the project team. While Bluetooth* is not used in the current iteration of the project, the board does have that functionality, which the team is considering for future use. Table 1. Prototype hardware use in the smart home project   Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE Arduino* 101 Board Processor / Microcontroller Intel® Atom™ processor E3815 (512K Cache, 1.46 GHz) Intel® Curie™ Compute Module @ 32 MHz Memory 8 GB DDR3L-1066 SODIMM (max) 196 KB flash memory 24 KB SRAM Networking / IO Integrated 10/100/1000 LAN 14 Digital IO pins 6 Analog IO pins Dimensions 190 mm x 116 mm x 40 mm 68.6 mm x 53.4 mm Specifications Full specs Full specs Figure 1. Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE and Arduino* 101 board For the sensors and other components needed in the creation of the prototype, the team chose the Grove Starter Kit for Arduino (manufactured by Seeed Studio), which is based on the Grove Starter Kit Plus used in the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit. This collection of components is available at low cost, and because it is a preselected set of parts, it reduces the effort required to identify and procure the bill of materials for IoT prototypes in general. Selection of sensors and other components for the prototype (detailed in the following section) are guided by key data that includes the following: Locked/unlocked status of the front door Open/closed status of the front door Open/closed status of the garage door Blocked/unblocked status of the garage door Events: doorbell ring, lock/unlock front door, open/close front door, open/close garage door, block garage door Prototype Software Specification For the prototype OS, the team considered Yocto Linux* as well as Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite. Yocto Linux supports the project’s ideal of using FOSS, and it offers a high degree of flexibility, as well as robust control over the source code and the ability to create a custom lightweight embedded OS that is tailored to the needs of the system. Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, on the other hand, provides an out-of-the-box implementation, without requirements for customization. It also provides Node- RED functionality for development. The team identified this combination of factors as a best practice for prototype development, and so Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite was chosen as the OS for the prototype. The following applications were identified to be developed as part of the solution: Control application will run on the smart-home model itself, gathering data from sensors and handling operation of the electromechanical aspects of the solution (for example, opening/closing the garage door), as well as data exchange with both human users (that is, through the administration and mobile applications) and with the cloud. Administration application will operate on a PC or tablet and allow for a detailed view into the operation of the smart home, including events, status, and logs, as well as access to the cloud data and analytics. Mobile application will operate on a smartphone or other mobile device, enabling a customer to open and close the garage door as well as monitor the progress of the door as it opens and closes or is blocked. Phase 3: Building and Refining the Proof of Concept Prototype Using the Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, the Arduino 101 board, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus IoT Edition, the team developed the proof of concept prototype illustrated in Figure 2. The prototype is built as a benchtop proof of concept that is not attached to mechanical parts such as working doors, which the project team determined are not required at this stage. Instead, for example, the rotary angle sensor is used to simulate the locking and unlocking of the front door, the stepper motor stands in for the garage door, and a simple button functions as the doorbell button would in a full model of the smart home. Figure 2. Smart home proof-of-concept prototype The bill of materials for the prototype is summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The control application used in the proof-of-concept prototype was written in JavaScript*. It accesses IBM Bluemix to transfer data to and from the mobile and administration applications to support functions that include opening and closing the garage door, locking and unlocking the front door, as well as for notifications of events such as the doorbell ringing. The mobile application was written in JavaScript for use in a web browser, to avoid the necessity of migrating the application to multiple smartphone platforms. The development environment used to develop the software for this solution was the Intel® XDK IoT Edition, which is included in the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit and can be downloaded free of charge. It enables developers to create and run Node.js applications directly on Intel® architecture-based IoT platforms, including the Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, as well as remote debugging capabilities. Node-RED is also a development option. In order to access I/O on the Intel NUC, it is necessary to declare MRAA, which is a C/C++ library with bindings to JavaScript and Python*, to interface with other platforms. It provides a structured and sane API, where port names and numbering match the physical hardware. For more information, visit GitHub. In addition, the development of this solution used Firmata, which allows for programmatic interaction with the Arduino development environment, taking advantage of Arduino’s hardware abstraction capabilities. Abstracting Firmata using Libmraa enables greater programmatic control of I/O on the Intel NUC, simplifying the process of gathering data from sensors. UPM provides the specific function calls that are used to access sensors. The smart home proof-of-concept prototype includes an activation button for the garage door, an activation button and buzzer for the doorbell, a touch sensor to identify the open/ closed status of the front door, a rotary angle sensor to simulate the locking and unlocking of the front door, and a backlit RGB LCD display that shows the open/closed status of the garage door and front door, as well as displaying a message when the doorbell is rung. The prototype also includes indicator LEDs that show the open/closed status of the garage door. The smart-home software application, which is built in Node.js, collects input data from the sensors and displays information on the LCD display. If the "Door Open" message is displayed on the LCD, the green LED is lit. If the "Door Close" message is displayed on the LCD, the red LED is lit. The application can also control a stepper motor to open and close an actual garage door, although for the sake of simplicity, the motor is not implemented in the proof-of-concept prototype. Phase 4: Producing a Solid Beta Version Once the proof of concept for the smart home was completed, the project team determined that the functionality was sufficiently successful to proceed with building a production version. The solution as a whole was conceived at this stage as including the following parts: Physical model of the home, built to scale and including the functional parts highlighted in the solution: the doorbell, front door, garage door, and related systems. Gateway, which is purchased as a commercial product based on Intel architecture and implemented using custom-developed software. Client application, implemented in JavaScript, which is used to control the solution as a whole and to generate and access cloud-based analytics. Cloud analytics, based on IBM Bluemix, which allow for the development of insights to improve business processes, based on usage data from the vending machine over time. Selecting Components for the Beta Version of the Project An early effort in the completion phases of the project involved selecting the specific components that would make up the final solution in production. Smart-Home Model Procurement Whereas the team had elected to create the proof-of-concept prototype as a board-level simulation of a smart home, it decided that the production version was to be based on a scale model of an actual house. The team engaged an external fabricator with expertise in building sophisticated, functional scale models. The initial specification for the smart-home model and an artist’s rendering of the finished model are shown in Figure 3. Other key decisions to be made at this stage included the choice of industrial- grade sensors, an Intel architecture- based gateway, a cloud service for data storage and analytics, and software technologies for the client application. Sensors and Related Components Selection Industrial-grade sensors and related components to replace those from the Grove Starter Kit that were used in the proof-of-concept prototype are detailed in Table 3. Custom model house built at 1/12 scale from tight-ply plywood with metal reinforcement, an approximate size of three feet in each dimension, and the following components: Manually-opened front door with Intel-provided sensors to detect open/closed status and operable doorbell button.

Ready commercial availability was clearly needed so the project could proceed on schedule. The gateway must also be available in sufficient quantities for the hypothetical productization of the smart-home concept. Ultimately, the Dell iSeries Wyse 3290 IoT Gateway, specifications of which are summarized in Table 4, was chosen for implementation in the product phase of this project. That gateway provides the needed performance for present and foreseeable functionality, as well as ready availability (potentially in large quantities) for hypothetical commercial distribution of the smart-home product. The team agreed that continuing to use Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (which the prototype was already based on) was a straightforward decision, particularly because the gateway is pre-validated for that OS. Moreover, Intel® NUCs and gateways can both run Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, simplifying the process of porting software elements from the prototype to the product version of the smart- home model. Likewise, the other core software components such as the Intel® XDK and libraries used in the prototype were held constant to simplify the transition to the product phase. Sensor status for the smart home product phase is summarized in Table 5. For each sensor, the "Open" and "Closed" values give the logic level returned, and "Edge Action" indicates what transitions to monitor. Table 4.

Figure 4. Smart home solution topology Phase 5: Evaluating Functionality and Adding Features Prior to evaluating the smart-home solution, the team installed the hardware and software components into the model, as shown in Figure 5. Differentiation of Administration and Mobile Applications Figure 5. Smart-home solution installed in model The project team identified that it would be valuable for the solution to include two separate applications for control and monitoring of the smart- home solution: Client application, for use by system administrators, supports test/debug functionality and provides access to cloud-analytics data. Mobile application, for use by end users, allows control of the doorbell and garage door opener and displays open/closed status of both doors. The team also decided to add status monitoring of the lock on the front door. Implementing Administration and Mobile Applications for Browsers Rather than providing multiple versions of a rich-client application for different platforms (or taking on the added complexity of cross-platform rich- client development), the team decided to implement the administration and mobile applications in HTML5 and JavaScript using the Intel XDK IoT Edition. This approach allows for a single version of each application to be consumed by multiple hardware platforms in use by administrators and end users. The key platforms identified by the team include the following: iOS* devices, including iPads* and iPhones* Android* devices, including smartphones and tablets Laptop and desktop PCs running Windows* or Linux Door Lock Functionality The team identified that it would be valuable to add functionality to show the locked/unlocked status of the front door, in addition to the open/closed status of the front door and garage door. Therefore, a door lock was added to the specifications of the model given to the fabricator. Cloud Alerts The following cloud-based functionality was added: When the garage door opens, a light turns on inside the garage. The light turns off after a specified period when the garage door is closed. If the garage door is left open for a specified period of time, an alert is generated to the user. If the front door is left open or unlocked for a certain period of time, an alert is generated to the user. Additional Authorization Methods for Entry The potential exists to integrate an open-ended set of ways for people to identify themselves to the smart-home systems, for access to the front door or garage door. These could potentially range from near field communication (NFC) functionality on a smartphone to biometrics such as thumbprint readers. This extension of functionality has not been implemented, but the modular nature of the smart-home design and availability of additional sensor capacity makes it plausible as a future effort. Phase 6: Finalizing Design and Releasing to Production The project team tasked with developing this solution was engineering-centric, and so producing first-rate UIs for the final product was somewhat outside the team’s core competency. Therefore, the team engaged an external resource on a contract basis for that purpose. The UI provider participated in regular team meetings and dedicated meetings with the core software-development team. Figure 6. Smart home administration application UI During those discussions, the UIs were refined to incorporate additional capabilities and functionality. For example, the team added more robust status indications for the garage door and front door to indicate whether the doors were open, closed, locked, or blocked. The visual appearance of the mobile application was changed to more closely evoke the appearance of a conventional garage door opener. Administration Application UI The administration application UI, shown in Figure 6, is designed to operate on a tablet computer and to provide administrative functionality for the smart home, based on cloud data. The administration application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Menu system contains a Home button to go to the home screen (shown in the figure), an About screen with information about the software, a Setup button that provides hardware-setup details (including placement and connectivity of sensors), and a Log button to access an events log that tracks the most recent instance of each type of event tracked, including the doorbell being rung, the front door being locked, unlocked, opened, or closed, and the garage door being opened, closed, or blocked. Notification panel displays event notifications about the doorbell being rung and changes in the status of the front door (opening, closing, locking, and unlocking) and the garage door (opening, closing, or being blocked). This display is based on data that is exchanged with and saved in the cloud, rather than locally derived data. It displays both the event itself and the sensor that has detected it. Status panel shows the most recent instances of each of the events tracked by the system, including the garage door being opened, closed, or blocked, the front door being opened, closed, locked, or unlocked, and the doorbell ringing. It includes timestamps for each event. Front door view shows the open or closed status of the door, as well as an animated icon to indicate whether the door is locked or unlocked. Visual notification is also provided when the doorbell is rung. Garage door view provides an animated display of the garage door opening, closing, or being blocked by an object as those actions occur. If the door is blocked, the application shows the block visually in the animation and prevents the door from closing. The administration application also provides pop-up notifications about requested actions that can’t be fulfilled, such as the "The front door is locked. Unlock it first." A similar notification occurs if a user tries to lock the door while it is open. Mobile Application UI Figure 7. Smart-home mobile application UI The mobile application UI, shown in Figure 7, is designed to operate on a smartphone, allowing customers to open and close the garage door on the smart home. It also reports on the status of the door, based on the polling of cloud data once per second. The mobile application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Notification panel shows the open or closed status of the garage door, and the action of the garage door opening or closing using an animation. It also indicates whether the door has been blocked by an obstruction by showing an obstruction within the animation and presenting a "Remove block to continue" dialog box to the user. Open and close buttons allow the user to remotely open and close the garage door. When a button is pressed, the application sends data to the cloud, receives a response from the cloud, and displays the status of the door based on that response. The administration application also responds immediately to actions taken with the mobile application. Conclusion A structured process is vital to the efficiency of moving a project such as the smart home described here from the early stages of ideation through prototyping and ultimately to production of a commercial solution. The six-phase approach described here is intended to provide a model that organizations can adapt to the needs of their own projects. By prototyping on low- cost components similar to those used by the maker community, the viability of a project can be discerned early in the project, whilvpne the investment in time and money is limited. For those projects that show promise, feature refinements can be made and the solution can be moved to a production-ready platform based on a commercial gateway and industrial-grade sensors and other components. This stepwise approach to project development provides a pathway toward commercially viable products that helps limit risk while enabling project teams to innovate freely.

This solution monitors the inventory, product sales, and maintenance of a vending machine. The gateway gathers data from temperature sensors, stepper motors, a coil switch, and a product-purchasing application for edge data analytics. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a rapid path-to-product IoT solution for retail using cloud data analytics, a proof of concept was created using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit that was scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, Intel® System Studio, and Microsoft* Azure* cloud services. This solution monitors the inventory, product sales, and maintenance of a vending machine. The gateway gathers data from temperature sensors, stepper motors, a coil switch, and a product-purchasing application for edge data analytics. This article contains an overview of the creation of the Intelligent Vending Machine Prototype. For a how to, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build an Intelligent Vending Machine. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. A key vector of opportunity related to the Internet of Things (IoT) springs from adding intelligence to everyday devices, as a means to improve their operation as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the business operations associated with them. For example, vending machines are ubiquitous, and the familiar, common machines with coin or currency acceptors represent a significant potential revenue stream for retailers of various types. It’s no wonder that the scope of goods available in vending machines has grown dramatically in recent years, including consumer electronics being commonly sold in airports and other facilities. Figure 1. Completed intelligent vending machine. Vending machines have the advantage over other retail points of presence that they operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, without the requirement for human cashiers. They also give distributors significant control where it would otherwise not be possible, such as in public spaces and office buildings. At the same time, however, vending machines require regular service: frequently to replenish the product being sold and less frequently for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Giving the owners of vending machines greater insight into the status of each unit in their vending fleet has the potential to improve the efficiency of that service effort. Intel® undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building an intelligent vending machine. The completed device is shown in Figure 1. This project drew inspiration in large part from the existing solution blueprint for intelligent vending machines from Intel and ADLINK Technologies. This document recounts the course of that project development effort. It begins with an abstract description of a structured project methodology, divided into phases, and then recounts the process of the project’s development in detail, phase by phase. Interested parties can use this narrative to retrace the steps taken by the Intel® project team in developing the intelligent vending machine. Perhaps more importantly, however, it can be generalized as a set of guidelines to address the needs of other types of projects. Intel® makes this document freely available and encourages the use of this methodology and process to drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the Internet of Things. Methodology By its nature, IoT embraces open-ended innovation, with endless diversity of projects to add intelligence to objects from the simple to the complex, and from the mundane to the exotic. At the same time, every project builds on experience the industry has gained from IoT projects that have gone before, and best practices suggest structural elements in common among IoT projects in general. To take advantage of those commonalities and help increase the chances of success during development, Intel has developed a structured approach to IoT project development. It consists of a six-phase model that guides the entire path to product, which begins with the first glimmer of an idea and follows through until the final solution is in commercial use. It is intended to be general enough that it can be adapted to the needs of any IoT project. Initiation phases (1-3) The first three phases of the project methodology are investigative. They focus on ideation and assessing the potential of the project to solve a given problem, in preparation for ultimately leading to a commercially viable product. As such, these phases value brainstorming and proof of concept over rigorously addressing finer points of design. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and the Grove* Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino 101" board. Phase 1:Define the opportunity that the project will take advantage of. The first step of an IoT project is to identify the problem or opportunity that the project will address. Documentation at this stage should identify the opportunity itself, the value of the solution (to end users as well as the organizations that build and implement it), and limitations of the project concept, including design challenges and constraints. Phase 2: Design a proof of concept to take advantage of the opportunity. The initial solution design proposes a practical approach to building the solution, including hardware, software, and network elements. The design must address the design challenges and constraints identified in Phase 1 to the extent that is possible before building a prototype, including due consideration of factors such as cost and security. Phase 3: Build and refine the proof of concept. The solution prototype is based on the design established in Phase 2, making and documenting changes as needed. Design changes based on shortcomings and additional opportunities identified during testing should be documented as part of this phase. Completion phases (4-6) The last three phases of the project methodology proceed only after the decision has been made to go forward with productizing the solution. As such, these phases are explicitly concerned with hardening the solution in terms of stability, security, and manageability, preparing it for mass production, and monetizing it to realize its commercial potential. The completion phases of the project involve shifting the solution to industrial-grade sensors and related components, building it out using a commercial-grade gateway, and finalizing the feature set. Phase 4: Produce a solid beta version. Once the project has been approved as a viable solution to develop toward production, the next step is to produce a product-oriented version that is explicitly intended to finalize the design. This version represents a significant investment in resources, including commercial-grade sensors and other components, as well as a commercial IoT gateway. Phase 5: Evaluate functionality and add features. The completed beta version of the solution is tested to verify that it functions correctly according to the design parameters. As part of the testing process, the project team also identifies additional features and functionality and incorporates them into the solution to make it more robust and valuable to end users. Phase 6: Finalize design and move into production. Once the product is feature-complete, the team hardens the solution by adding advanced manageability and security features, as well as optimizing the design as needed to enhance factors such as marketability and efficiency of manufacturing. The production user interface (UI) for the solution is finalized. This phase also includes final planning for merchandising and marketing the solution before moving into full production. Phase 1: Defining the opportunity While traditional vending machines represent lucrative revenue streams, they are woefully inefficient. Each machine must be serviced on a regular basis by a human attendant to replenish the machine’s stock of product. This task is typically handled by assigning machines to regular routes that are followed by personnel in trucks. To understand the inherent inefficiency in this approach, consider the activity along a route that includes a high-rise office building. Here, the attendant pulls up in front of the building and has the choice either to guess what will be needed in the machines up on the 15th and 20th floors, bring the product up, and then make another round trip to bring the rest of what was needed, or else to make a dedicated inventory trip with a notepad in hand. Either approach takes needless time and effort that costs the vending company money. Moreover, distributors must seek a balance between dispatching too many trips by attendants (wasting payroll hours) or too few (leaving machines depleted of stock and missing out on revenue). The situation becomes even more problematic because the distributor must depend to some degree on end-customers to report when a machine is out of order. Project initiators at Intel® determined that an intelligent vending machine is viable as the basis for a potential project to demonstrate IoT capabilities and the project methodology described in this document. That core group identified skill sets that were likely to be required during the project, including project management, programming, cloud architecture, and documentation. Based on that list of required skills, the core group formed the full project team, with personnel on the project mostly drawn from Intel employees, with external personnel included in a small number of instances to round out the expertise of the team. The full project team’s first order of business was to quantify the potential opportunity associated with the project, as the basis for the initial prototype design. The core opportunity for this use case was identified as enabling a vending machine to intelligently monitor its level of product inventory and its operational status, and to be able to report that information back through an IoT gateway to the cloud. The team elected to integrate cloud resources for the data store and administrative functionality. The goal of this approach was to facilitate a fully connected and scalable solution that optimize operations using an overall view of a fleet of vending machines. The key value to the cloud approach lies in the potential for analytics, which could potentially predict sales to optimize the supply chain among many distributed machines. It could also be used to optimize the efficiency of the personnel who replenish the inventory in the machines and perform unscheduled mechanical maintenance. Phase 2: Designing the proof-of-concept prototype The project team determined that, for this project to be as useful as possible for the developer community, it should be based on readily available parts and technologies. Based on that decision, it was decided to limit the bill of materials to the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, Intel® IoT Developer Kit, and Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/gateways/wind-river), using software technologies that are widely used in the industry and available at low or no cost, with the use of free open-source software (FOSS) wherever practical. To accelerate the prototype stage and reduce its complexity, the team elected to build the local portion of the prototype as a bench model that would consist of the compute platform and sensors, without incorporating an actual vending machine, although such a device would be added at a future stage of the project. Prototype hardware selection The Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE small-form-factor PC was chosen for this project. This platform is pictured in Figure 2, and its high-level specifications are given in Table 1. In addition to its robust performance, the team felt that, as Intel’s most recently introduced hardware platform specifically targeting IoT, it was a forward-looking choice for this demonstration project. Based on the Intel® Atom™ processor E3815, the Intel NUC offers a fanless thermal solution, 4 GB of onboard flash storage (and SATA connectivity for additional storage), as well as a wide range of I/O. The Intel NUC is conceived as a highly compact and customizable device that provides capabilities at the scale of a desktop PC. To simplify the process of interfacing with sensors, the team elected to take advantage of the Arduino* ecosystem using the Arduino* 101 board, also shown in Figure 2, with specifications given in Table 1. This board makes the Intel NUC both hardware and pin compatible with Arduino shields, in keeping with the open-source ideals of the project team. While Bluetooth* is not used in the current iteration of the project, the board does have that functionality, which the team is considering for future use. Figure 2. Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE and Arduino* 101 board. Table 1. Prototype hardware used in intelligent vending project.   Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE Arduino* 101 Board Processor/ Microcontroller Intel® Atom™ processor E3815 (512K Cache, 1.46 GHz) Intel® Curie™ Compute Module @ 32 MHz Memory 8 GB DDR3L-1066 SODIMM (max) 196 KB flash memory 24 KB SRAM Networking / IO Integrated 10/100/1000 LAN 14 Digital I/O pins 6 Analog IO pins Dimensions 190 mm x 116 mm x 40 mm 68.6 mm x 53.4 mm Full Specs specs specs For the sensors and other components needed in the creation of the prototype, the team chose the Grove* Starter Kit for Arduino* (manufactured by Seeed Studio), which is based on the Grove* Starter Kit Plus used in the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit. This collection of components is available at low cost, and because it is a pre-selected set of parts, it reduces the effort required to identify and procure the bill of materials for IoT prototypes in general. Selection of sensors and other components for the prototype (detailed in the following section) are guided by the following key data: Internal temperature of the machine Inventory levels of each vendable item in the machine Door open or closed status Detection of a jam in the vending coil Prototype software specification For the prototype OS, the team considered Yocto Linux* as well as the Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite. Yocto Linux supports the project’s ideal of using free open-source software (FOSS), and it offers a high degree of flexibility, as well as robust control over the source code and the ability to create a custom lightweight embedded OS that is tailored to the needs of the system. Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite, on the other hand, provides an out-of-the-box implementation, without requirements for customization. The team identified this combination of factors as a best practice for prototype development, and so Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite was chosen as the OS for the prototype. The following applications were identified to be developed as part of the solution: Control application will run on the vending machine itself, gathering data from sensors and handling operation of the electromechanical aspects of the solution (e.g., turning the vending coils) as well as data exchange with both human users (e.g., customers and administrators) and with the cloud. Administration application will operate on a PC or tablet and allow for a detailed view into the operation of the vending machine, including events, status, and logs, as well as access to the cloud data and analytics. This application will also support regular maintenance. Customer application will operate on a smartphone or other mobile device, enabling a customer to purchase products from the machine. Phase 3: Building and refining the proof-of-concept prototype Using the Intel NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, the Arduino 101 board, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus IoT Edition, the team developed the proof of concept prototype illustrated in Figure 3 to simulate a simple vending machine that dispenses two products. It includes a 2x16-character LCD display that shows product names and price information, as well as two product selection buttons, a step motor to dispense products, and two LEDs (green and red) to show the machine status. It also includes a temperature sensor and a "fault detection" button. Once the buy button on the customer application is pressed, the product is dispensed; for simplicity, payment processing hardware was left out of the prototype. Figure 3. Intelligent vending machine proof of concept prototype. Prototype Hardware Implementation The bill of materials for the prototype is summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

It also uses a Node.js component for accessing the Azure cloud. The cloud is used to exchange events with the mobile and administration applications. Such events include for example, temperature alerts and product dispense requests. The mobile application was written in JavaScript* for use in a web browser, to avoid the necessity of migrating the application to multiple smartphone platforms. The development environment used to develop the software for this solution was Intel® System Studio, a plug-in for the Eclipse* IDE that facilitates connecting to the NUC and developing applications in C/C++. In addition, the development of this solution used Libmraa, a C/C++ library that allows for direct access to I/O on the NUC, as well as Firmata, which allows for programmatic interaction with the Arduino development environment, taking advantage of Arduino’s hardware abstraction capabilities. Abstracting Firmata using Libmraa enables greater programmatic control of I/O on the NUC, simplifying the process of gathering data from sensors. UPM provides the specific function calls that are used to access sensors. Phase 4: Producing a Solid Beta Version With a proof of concept prototype up and running, the team turned its attention to creating the production version of the intelligent vending machine. The solution as a whole was conceived as including the following main parts: Vending machine, which dispenses products and communicates data back through the gateway. This part of the solution is complex and custom-built, including a variety of sensors and related components. Gateway, which is purchased as a commercial product based on Intel architecture and implemented using custom-developed software. Administration and Customer application, implemented in JavaScript, which is used to control the solution as a whole and to generate and access cloud-based analytics. Cloud analytics, based on Microsoft Azure, which allow for the development of insights to improve business processes, based on usage data from the vending machine over time. Selecting Vending Machine Components An early effort in the completion phases of the project involved selecting the specific components that would make up the final solution in production. Vending Machine Device Procurement Whereas the team had elected to create the proof of concept prototype as a board-level simulation of a vending machine, the production version was to be an actual, functioning vending machine. The team investigated having a custom machine purpose built, as well as purchasing a used machine that could be retrofitted for the purposes of this project. Ultimately, a custom machine was selected in order to support selling the widest possible range of products. The initial specification for the custom vending machine and a picture of the machine itself at an early stage of fabrication are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Vending machine specification and photo of device during fabrication. Vending Machine Model Specification Custom tabletop vending machine for a variety of small products packed in boxes, blister packs, or bags. Each of three coil-driven vend trays will be configured for a different size product: 3" close pitch coil for 12-14 small blister packs 4" medium pitch coil for 9-12 medium size boxes or packages large 5-6" coil for 6-8 larger packages such as t-shirts The coils will be driven from one stepper motor per coil and drop product in to a singlewide tray at the bottom of the machine. There will be a plexi-window to view vend selections and optional cutouts for Intel choice of flatscreen and/or keypad. Machine body will be powder-coated steel, trays will be aluminum, and vend coils will be plated steel. Front of machine will open to refill product, and rear will open to install and service vending mechanism. Approximate dimensions of machine will be 24-30" deep x 36" tall x 30" wide. Overall target weight is under 70lbs. Customer applications allows for purchasing products. Other key decisions to be made at this stage included the choice of industrial-grade sensors, an Intel® architecture-based commercial gateway, a fully supported production OS, a cloud service for data storage and analytics, and software technologies for the administration and customer application. Sensors and Related Components Selection Industrial-grade sensors and related components to replace those from the Grove Starter Kit that were used in the proof of concept prototype are detailed in Table 3.

Ready commercial availability was clearly needed so the project could proceed on schedule. While some members of the team expressed preference for the Vantron VT-M2M-QK gateway, difficulty in obtaining that device in a timely manner disqualified it from use in the project. Ultimately, the Dell iSeries Wyse 3290 IoT Gateway, specifications of which are summarized in Table 4, was chosen for implementation in the product phase of this project. That gateway provides the needed performance for present and foreseeable functionality, as well as ready availability (potentially in large quantities) for hypothetical distribution of the vending machine as a commercial product. Table 4. Gateway specifications for intelligent vending machine product phase.   Dell iSeries Wyse* 3290 IoT Gateway Processor Intel® Celeron® processor N2807 (1 M cache, up to 2.16 GHz) Memory 4 GB DDR3 RAM 1600 MHz Networking LAN: 1 x 10/100/1000 BASE-T WLAN: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac PAN: Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Physical Specifications Dimensions: 69mm x 197.5mm x 117mm Weight: 2.34kg Continuing to use Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite (which the prototype was already based on) was a straightforward decision, particularly because the gateway is pre-validated for that OS. Moreover, Intel NUCs and gateways can both run Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite, simplifying the process of porting software elements from the prototype to the product version of the intelligent vending machine model. Likewise, the other core software components such as Intel System Studio and the libraries used in the prototype were held constant to simplify the transition to the product phase. Online Operation The system includes the software running on the IoT gateway, the Azure cloud, and a server-side application, as illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5. Intelligent vending machine topology: online operation. IoT Gateway Software Implementation The IoT gateway software consists of three parts: Control application is implemented in C++ using the IoT Developer Kit libraries libmraa and libupm; it performs the following tasks: Check for mechanical failures and report failure/no-failure events to the local database. Monitor for temperature fluctuations in and out of the allowed range, reporting events when the temperature goes out of and returns to that range. Check for events from product selection buttons that occur in the customer application, followed by the application generating a "dispense" event, which is sent to the machine through the cloud. Local DB is used for inter-process communication between the control application and the DB daemon. The local SQLite database uses the file $HOME/Vending_Prototype/events.sqlite3, which contains the "events" table with the events to be reported to the cloud. The events table is replicated both ways to and from the machine. DB daemon is implemented using Node.js; it sends reported events bi-directionally between the local database and the cloud. Azure Cloud Implementation The Azure cloud maintains information about product inventory for the intelligent vending machine, keeps track of the events received from customer app and vending machine, and provides functionality to analyze this data and trigger responses to various conditions (e.g., low inventory or mechanical failure). Primary cloud analytics functions are as follows: If a product is out of stock, that information is sent to the cloud and an alert displays in the admin app for the user. If the vending machine internal temperature reaches above or below a preset threshold, that information is sent to the cloud for analysis. An alert displays in the admin app for the user. If any of the three vending machine coils function improperly, that information is sent to cloud for analysis. An alert displays in the admin app for the user. If the vending machine tray is pulled out, "Machine Opened" status displays red in LCD and LED. Once the tray is pushed back in, "Machine is ready" status displays green in LCD and LED. The Admin app provides information regarding home, setup, log history, inventory status and alert details. Phase 5: Finalizing Design and Releasing to Production The project team tasked with developing this solution was engineering-centric, and so producing first-rate UIs for the final product was somewhat outside the team’s core competency. Therefore, the team engaged an external resource on a contract basis for that purpose. The UI provider participated in regular team meetings and dedicated meetings with the core software-development team. During those discussions, the UIs were refined to incorporate additional capabilities and functionality. For example, the team added color coding and options for switching between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures to the administration application UI. Functionality was added to the customer application UI asking users to verify that they wish to make the purchase before the transaction is made, along with other minor refinements. Admin Application The administration application UI, shown in Figure 6, is designed to operate on a tablet computer and to provide administrative functionality on the intelligent vending machine. Figure 6. Intelligent vending machine administration application UI. The administration application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Menu system contains a "home" button to go the home screen (shown in the figure), an "About" screen with information about the software, a "Setup" button that provides hardware-setup details (including placement and connectivity of sensors), a "Log" button to access an events log that tracks purchases, alerts, and maintenance, and an "Alert" button that provides information about active maintenance alerts, including the type and time of occurrence for each alert. Inventory panel reflects inventory levels that are set within the cloud, using color coding to indicate those levels: dark blue for levels above two thirds of capacity, lighter blue for levels one third to two thirds, and orange for levels below one third. Clicking on the panel generates a detailed inventory window that displays exact inventory quantities, which tray the item is in, and price for each item. Temperature module is a dual-threshold radial temperature graph, with display of the machine’s current internal temperature selectable as Fahrenheit or Celsius. The white bar represents the acceptable temperature range; if the temperature goes outside that range, the system generates an alert. The software polls the temperature and updates the UI every few seconds. Coil status module reports on the status of the vending coils and motors, indicating if there is any malfunction, such as a jam or electrical failure. Vending unit module provides visual information about the presence and location of error conditions, as well as the door open/closed status. Customer Application The customer application, shown in Figure 7, is designed to operate on a mobile device, allowing customers to interact with the vending machine in order to make a purchase. Figure 7. Intelligent vending machine customer application. The customer application incorporates the following primary elements: Status pane indicates whether the machine is ready for an order to be made, and it also functions as a shopping cart to display a list of items selected by the user, pending sale. When items are added to the shopping cart, a "Buy" button appears that indicates the sale total; clicking on that button completes the purchase by sending the order information to the cloud and upon receipt of confirmation from the cloud, dispensing the item and updating the inventory number. Ordering pane contains a selection button for each product in the machine; when clicked, the button adds the item to the shopping cart list in the status pane. Each product button is accompanied by fields that display the amount of inventory in stock as well as the price of the item. Completed Production Vending Machine The assembled intelligent vending machine, with the gateway, sensors, and other components installed, is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Fully assembled intelligent vending machine. Phase 6: Evaluating Functionality and Adding Features Once the actual product version of the vending machine was operational, several team members began to identify possible future functionality that could be built into the product. Enhancing Cloud Analytics The team identified the opportunity to enhance cloud-analytics functionality using the Microsoft Power BI service and Power BI Desktop, a cloud-hosted business intelligence and analytics service that is integrated into Microsoft Azure. These capabilities offer data-visualization enhancements for the intelligent vending solution. Enhancing Event Notification Data Flows During the evaluation phase, the team identified possibilities to automate certain aspects of the machine’s operation using event notifications in conjunction with Azure analytics. Specifically, future enhancements based on the following data flows were identified: Inventory. If the quantity of a product drops to two units, a future enhancement could cause a notification to be sent to the cloud for analysis, and an alert could be sent to the administration application as a notification to reorder stock. This sequence could be repeated if the quantity drops to zero, and notification could also be sent to the machine display and the mobile application, indicating that the item is out of stock. Maintenance. If the machine malfunctions (e.g., the coil fails to make a full turn, the temperature goes outside preset limits, etc.), a future enhancement could cause a notification to be sent to the cloud for analysis, and service personnel could be notified. An alert could also be sent to the administration application to monitor the status of the service call. Conclusion Tracing the path to product during the development of the intelligent vending machine is intended as a pattern for teams to consider as they build their own solutions. Beginning with an ideation phase and rapid prototyping on low-cost equipment and a simplified physical model allows projects to take off quickly. Decisions can therefore be made early about the potential viability of the project, when a relatively small investment in time and money has been made. This project also suggests a model for thinking about cloud analytics in IoT solutions. Rather than focusing just on opportunities for big-data insights, this implementation reveals how the cloud can function foremost as a communication nexus and centralized data store. At the same time, the cloud data provides substantial opportunities for generating business intelligence to optimize supply chains, increase maintenance efficiency, and enhance profitability.

Robotics is an exciting and fun hobby that has become very affordable in recent years. Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Summary This project is about a simple obstacle avoiding robot using Intel® Edison module. Robotics is an exciting and fun hobby that has become very affordable in recent years. Lets do it. Parts List Cardboard. Battery. Ball bearing for front roller. 2 servo motors. 2 matching wheels. Intel Edison with Arduino breakout board. Breadboard. Ultrasonic Range sensor – HC-SR04. Capacitors (220uF). Jumper Wires,rubber bands,Glues, etc… Steps To Be Followed Step 1: Chassis We chose a simple cardboard based chassis with the servos attached to it with the help of rubber bands. Make it convenient for your use. The above choices work as long as your rover is roving over smooth surfaces. Attach the front ball bearing in front of the cardboard. Set front wheel ball bearing: Attach single servo motor: Attach both servo motors: our chassis is ready. Step 2: Arduino Board With Intel Edison Configure your arduino board with intel edison. Look at this link to configure (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/library/edison-getting-started). Make sure your serial communiction and port are fixed. Check out your arduino board with intel edison by loading a simple program to your board. Let's check out our board with simple blinking led. Step 3: Battery And Board Mount this battery using battery holder and board then later secure it to the chassis using rubber bands – surprisingly this works pretty well (remember this is planned on using this on smooth surfaces only – adjust the attach according to your plans). We have to use 6 AA battery holder in order to hold six batteries (based on motors you can use your batteries). Step 4: Arduino Pins These are the ARDUINO PINS which it is attached for this project. You can set the pins on your own. Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) ECHO 9 Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) TRIG 10 Servo signal (left) 5 Servo signal (right) 6 Step 5: Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) First of all check Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) by using a simple arduino code. Connect the ultra sonic sensor using some jumper wires. Here we have checked our ultra sonic sensor using simple program. By checking in serial port of arduino uno we can have a clear thought that it is working. Ultrasonic sensor shows the distance of the object in front of it. Here in our code distance is calculated in centimeter. Below image shows the distance calculated by ultrasonic sensor in serial port (cm). Step 6: Servo Motor Connections The wiring needed for connecting the servo cable — 3 pin connection coming out from the servo – red (vcc), black(ground) and in my case yellow(signal). The picture (Servo wiring 1) shows the 220uF capacitor connected between vcc/ground – this is needed for each servo in order to avoid the brownout issues. Since we are using the same battery source to power the servos and the board. on sudden rover turn of directions, there can be spikes of current draw which can cause the board to recycle if we don’t provide a sizeable capacitor (220uF works just fine in our case). The pictures show wiring for 1 servo without the servo cable attached (Servo wiring 1) with the servo cable attached (Servo wiring 2) and then both the servo cables attached. Step 7: Coding And Testing Apply the code and test it. #include<Servo.h>
#define trigpin 10 // Trigger pin
#define echopin 9 // echo pin

Servo servoLeft;
Servo servoRight;

int forward = 180;
int backward = 0;

void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
servoLeft.attach(5);
servoRight.attach(6);

pinMode(trigpin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(echopin, INPUT);

}

void loop ()
{
int duration, distance;
servoRight.write(forward);
servoLeft.write(forward);

digitalWrite(trigpin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(1000);
digitalWrite(trigpin, LOW);
duration = pulseIn(echopin, HIGH);

distance = ( duration / 2) / 29.1;

delay(1000);
if (distance >= 10)
{
Serial.print(distance);
Serial.println(&rdquo; cm&rdquo;);
}
else
{
Serial.println(&ldquo;danger&rdquo;);
servoLeft.write(90);
servoRight.write(90);
delay(1000);

servoLeft.write(backward);
servoRight.write(forward);
delay(5000);
servoLeft.write(forward);
servoRight.write(forward);

}

} Now we have done. Here is our simple obstacle avoiding robot using intel edison.

This solution monitors the temperature within a truck’s refrigerated cargo area, as well the open or closed status of the cargo doors. The gateway generates events based on changes to those statuses, to support end-user functionality on a tablet PC application. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a rapid path-to-product edge IoT solution for the transportation sector, a proof of concept was created using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit. That prototype was scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, and Intel® System Studio. This solution monitors the temperature within a truck’s refrigerated cargo area, as well the open or closed status of the cargo doors. The gateway generates events based on changes to those statuses, to support end-user functionality on a tablet PC application. Figure 1. The finished product demonstration with custom trailer housing. The core opportunity associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) lies in adding intelligence and connectivity to everyday devices, harnessing information and putting it to use in ways that add value. Monitoring the status of a refrigerated semi-truck trailer hauling perishable goods is a simple example. Alerting the driver when the temperature passes outside a pre-set range or when cargo doors are opened unexpectedly can help avoid financial losses. An IoT solution to monitor and track these aspects of a semi-truck trailer could therefore be a viable commercial product. Intel undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building a connected transportation solution. The project was presented as a demonstration at Intel® Developer Forum in 2015 and again in 2016. This document recounts the course of the project development effort, to help drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the Internet of Things. For a how to for this project, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build a Connected Transportation Solution. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. Introduction The goal of this project was to build a functional prototype and then to transition that proof of concept into an industrial-grade solution for scalable deployment as a commercial product. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and sensors and their components from the Grove* Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Hardware used in the prototype stage of this project is illustrated in Figure 1, and specifications are given in Table 1. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino* 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino* 101" board. Table 1.

Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE and Arduino* 101 board. The course of this project demonstrates the value of the path-to-product approach: it allows a prototype to be built with a relatively small investment of time and effort, followed by an efficient transition to a commercially viable solution. Using a precompiled OS as well as RPMs helps to eliminate unnecessary downloads, having to customize the OS, and identifying libraries necessary to bring a project to life. This project was devised to contribute to innovations around solutions for similar use cases being produced and marketed. While this project was designed to provide only basic functionality, its design is flexible and extensible enough that a variety of features could be added. In particular, the project could be expanded in the future to include web connectivity, cloud capabilities, remote monitoring, and other components. In the project’s earliest stages, the team listed potential features for the prototype and the product. A sample of these included rear-door status (open or closed), temperature of the trailer, alarms based on the state of the door and temperature, an online application to view data, and in-cab monitoring of information. To demonstrate the viability of creating a robust solution while maintaining simplicity and low cost, the team elected to limit the bill of materials for the prototype phase to just the contents of the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit. Creating the Prototype Proof of Concept To allow for separation of duties and efficient progress, the team divided the solution into three primary areas of effort: User interface (UI). Part of the team began working on the actual production UI layout and design, looking ahead to the production stages of the project. Application business logic. Part of the team began working on the logic for the prototype application, while also recognizing that changes would be needed as the project progressed toward the commercial solution. Prototype sensor solution. Part of the team began to create the configuration of sensors for the solution, utilizing the UPM/MRAA libraries for rapid development. This approach of separating the project into discrete segments allowed the team to progress through the prototype phase more rapidly than otherwise, taking best advantages of skill sets available within the team. In particular, while the user interface was not strictly required in the early phases of the project, it was expected to require the most development time of the three areas listed above. Therefore, so beginning it as early as possible allowed for it to be well underway by the time it was needed later in the project. In terms of the application logic, the team was able to look ahead to the expected final functional prototype and make decisions in the early prototype process looking to the future. Overall, the team expected the operation of the door sensor to be relatively simple, allowing greater attention to the proper utilization of a temperature sensor on a small and then commercial scale. By utilizing the sensors in the Grove* Starter Kit Plus, we were able to rapidly create a prototype with a functional sensor environment that the UI team could work with. This approach enabled layout and design elements to come to life quickly and provided a future framework for the final functional use case. The prototype configuration, with the Intel® NUC, Arduino* 101 board, and sensors, is illustrated in Figure 3. The bill of materials is given in Table 2. Figure 3. Developer kit with selected sensors enabled. Table 2.

Solid red LED lights up in cab. LCD displays current temperature and door status (open), as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Showing door status. Touch temperature sensor to raise ambient room temperature by five degrees: Buzzer sounds. Red LED blinks continuously. LCD turns red and displays actual temperature and door status (open), as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Showing high temperature status. Touch sensor to acknowledge alert (buzzer turns off). Press button to close the door: Red LED continues to blink until temperature passes below threshold. LCD displays temperature and door status (closed). When temperature passes below threshold, blinking red LED turns off, solid green LED lights up, and LCD turns green. LCD displays temperature and door status (closed). Simulation This simulation demonstrates the reduced potential loss of temperature-sensitive cargo by monitoring temperature changes and alerting the driver if it becomes critical, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6. Log file showing events. Figure 7. Base online view as envisioned. Target Commercial Solution With an operational prototype based on the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, it was necessary to determine how to proceed to create a commercial solution. Table 3 outlines how the components used in the prototype phase could be transitioned to a production solution. Table 3. Components in prototype versus production solution.   Prototype Production Solution Buzzer Grove Kit Buzzer Alarm on Phone (customer application) LCD Grove LCD panel Screen on Phone (customer application) LED (RED) Grove Kit LED Light on Phone (customer application) Button Grove Kit Button Industrial magnetic sensor with paired magnet Touch Sensor Grove Kit Touch Sensor Touch on Phone (customer application) Temp Sensor Grove Kit Temp Sensor Commercial Temp Sensor Heat Source Person’s Finger 20-watt Halogen Puck Light Gateway Intel® NUC and Arduino 101 Board Intel® IoT Gateway In addition, there are many commercial gateways available, with design differences making them suited to various industries and use cases. A key consideration for this project was a broad range of I/O options, to support both current and future functionality, specifically for connecting sensors to provide a data feed. An Intel® IoT Gateway was chosen as the gateway device for the product portion of this project, as shown in Figure 8. The processing power and I/O functions were deemed sufficient for the presented commercial usage. A wired Modbus temperature sensor was chosen to provide a reliable connection to obtain temperature readings every several seconds. All communications on devices were performed via direct wiring or via Ethernet. Standard MRAA/UPM libraries were maintained throughout the process without any modifications. The gateway acts as a web server, storing data as well as making calls to the temperature sensor to keep the data fresh. The Java UPM Library uses libmodbus to read and send periodic updates from the Comet* temperature sensor to the Tomcat* web server. Figure 8. Gateway installed as part of demo with temperature sensor. Transferring Code to the Gateway Typically, ramping up to a commercial gateway involves having to revamp code so that it is compatible with whichever services are available on the system. In this case, the coding on the prototype was all performed in Java*, HTML, and JavaScript*, making the transition to a commercial solution relatively simple. The code transition was simplified by the use of the same MRAA/UPM libraries in both phases of the project. Mapping Grove Sensors to Industrial Sensors Using MRAA and UPM libraries can help jumpstart a project. The following steps cover porting the app to the commercial product solution: Target desired industrial hardware: Determine whether the hardware requires additional libraries or application support. If needed, integrate libraries and software and create OS layers for software deployment. Once commercial product hardware is successfully integrated into the prototype solution, remove the code that is no longer needed: Utilize existing layers created during the prototype phase to install solution dependencies. Make changes as needed for new hardware. Take new and old layers and build into production runtime. Complete all installation and testing on production hardware. Customer Application The base customer application, shown in Figures 9 through 12, was created to replace the functionality of the Grove LCD, LED, buzzer, and touch sensor that the driver would interact with. In the production solution, the customer application would reside on the mobile device carried by the driver, allowing for easy notification and response to alerts. The customer application is quite simple in this example but could be easily expanded. It has two status indicators that refer to temperature and door status. An alert button becomes active and then gives an acknowledge button to clear the alert. Figure 9. Main status screen. Figure 10. Status showing an alert. Figure 11. Showing a full alert and acknowledge button active. Figure 12. Initial setup screen finding IP address of gateway. Conclusion This exercise demonstrates use of the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit to rapidly develop a prototype. With wide-ranging libraries, the ease of use of the Developer Kit simplifies the development process while also providing high compatibility for commercialization of the product. Scaling up to a commercial gateway was quite easy, as the team was able to directly copy code and have it function immediately.

Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. The Arduino 101*/Genuino 101* board is the first development board to be powered by Intel® Curie™ technology. It counts with the same peripheral list and controllers as the Arduino* UNO board. Sharing the same physical shape and pin layout as the UNO board, the Arduino 101 board accepts many of the shields that fit in its predecessor; you can also interchange cases and mounts between the two boards. The Arduino board has a dual-core x86 32-bit Intel® Quark™ processor, which allows for multithreaded applications and enables the use of powerful peripherals that the UNO board did not support. The board’s operating voltage is 3.3 V input/output (I/O), with 5 V tolerance, meaning that you can also connect 5 V components. It has 20 general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins: 14 digital I/O pins and 6 pins for analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). It is equipped with four pulse width modulation (PWM) pins and three channel logic converters connected to the GPIO pins. The Arduino 101 board has an in-circuit serial programming header with serial peripheral interface (SPI) signals that you can use to access microcontrollers and I2C dedicated pins. With a built-in six-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth* low energy (Bluetooth* LE), you can easily create Internet of Things (IoT) apps that allow you to use your smartphone to control your board (Figure 1). Figure 1. Arduino 101* board with Intel® Curie™ technology ADC and PWM So, what does all this mean? To understand ADC and PWM, you first need to take a closer look at analog and digital signals. For components to communicate, they must send signals—think of them as messages—that reflect a change of state in a given time. In electronics, the quantity being measured is voltage. How the change takes place is what differentiates these two types of signals. You can represent signals (change in voltage over time) in graphs: Analog signals are shown as smooth, continuous waves given that the transition in voltage is gentle, while digital signals are represented in square waves where there is an "on" (5 V) or "off" (0 V) state only (Figure 2). Figure 2. Digital (squared) and analog (smooth) signals Most communication between integrated circuits is digital, and ADC allows microcontrollers to read signals from analog devices. Conversely, digital-to-analog conversion allows the microcontroller to generate an analog signal and communicate with the analog interface. PWM comes into play when you want to control the time variable in a digital signal, allowing for a longer on or off state. The amount of time the signal is on (5 V) is known as duty cycle. Figure 3 provides a graph representation of various duty cycles. You can alter the time unit to have the on state for a longer or shorter period. The bigger the duty cycle percentage, the longer the LED will be lit and so reducing the time the LED is off (0 V). PWM can be demonstrated using an LED; a common example is the fade effect, where by switching the on and off state very fast, you can mimic analog behavior. Remember that in analog waves, the transition between on and off is smoother; therefore, to the observer, the LED will seem to fade. In a digital setup, the change is more abrupt, and you will only see the LED rapidly switching between on and off. PWM allows the LED to trick your eye by making it seem as if it’s fading even when using digital signals. On an RGB LED (composed of one red, one green, and one blue LED), each color can be represented at a different percentage, which affects the light’s overall color. If you have green and blue at a 50 percent duty cycle (equal quantities) while red is at 0 percent, the light generated will be teal. Figure 3. LEDs whose pulse width modulation is set at 50 percent, 25 percent, and 100 percent duty cycles, respectively Serial Communication: Interintegrated Circuit, SPI, and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter The Arduino 101 board uses serial communication between its microcontrollers and peripherals. In serial systems, you can send only 1 bit at a time, while in parallel communications, you send multiple bits. You can think of serial as a single-lane road and parallel as a multilane highway. SPI and interintegrated circuit (I2C) are serial buses that communicate through digital signals. Think of a bus as a road for data transpiration: Its purpose is to allow communication between multiple master–slave chips, where one device acts as the controller (master) while others are being controlled (slaves; see Figure 4). The board uses I2C for communication with slower, on-board peripherals that it accesses occasionally. It only requires 2 wires to have up to 127 devices, where each receives a unique identifier that the master uses to recognize its slaves. I2C can read and write data from and to many sensors. Synchronous systems require a clock to ensure that the data is written and read at the correct tempo. The master defines which device is performing which action (read/write). The serial clock (SCL) wire provides the clock signal that the master generates, which synchronizes the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus. The serial data (SDA) is the second wire, and it carries the data flowing through the bus. Because of its simplicity and being a low-bandwidth protocol, it’s a great option for infrequently accessed devices, but it’s slower than SPI. Figure 4. Interintegrated circuit master–slave bus with serial data and serial clock lines. SPI allows one master and one or multiple slaves using four signal types. Think of them as four channels (lines) of communications between the masters and slaves: Master-out-slave-in (MOSI). Carries data from master to slave (data line) Master-in-slave-out (MISO). Carries data from the slave to the master (data line) Serial-clock (SCLK). Clock signal that synchronizes the system Slave-select line (SS_). Used to select and enable the slave on the bus; notifies the slave that it should wake up and send or receive data You can set up SPI in two ways. If all slaves share the same slave-select line, SPI requires a minimum of four wires (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, SS_). Another option is to give each slave have its own SS_ line to connect to the master; here, you need an additional wire per slave. Figure 5 summarizes these two setups. Figure 5. A serial peripheral interface with one shared slave-select line (SS_) versus each slave with its own SS_ line When contrasting I2C and SPI, you should also understand the concept of full duplex and half-duplex. Full-duplex communication is where two parties (slave and master in this context) can send data at the same time. In half-duplex communication, one party has to wait until the other is done sending data. Taking a closer look, given that SPI is full duplex, it has an additional data wire compared to half-duplex I2C, where there is only one data line and it can’t send and receive data at the same time (Figure 6). Figure 6. Serial peripheral interface versus interintegrated circuit communication In asynchronous systems, there is no clock to dictate when the information is sent. Instead, the sender and receiver must agree on a speed (bit rate) at which the information will be communicated. If the sender is delivering at a faster rate, the receiver won’t be able to understand the data being sent because it will be processing it at a lower tempo. Therefore, it’s essential that you establish a bit rate to effectively use asynchronous communication. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is an asynchronous unit now commonly included in microcontrollers, and it acts as an intermediary between parallel and serial interfaces. It’s intended to have two connected devices, where the transmitter’s output, labeled Tx, is connected through a unidirectional data line to the receiver (Rx input; Figure 7). In this fashion, one UART takes bytes of data (1 byte = 8 bits) and transmits each individual bit through the Tx line to the receiving UART (Rx line). On the receiver end, the UART reassembles the bits, generating the byte that was originally sent. Figure 7. Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter send and receive bus Summary The Arduino 101 board is equipped with a broad array of pins, chips, and other devices that communicate by using synchronous and asynchronous methods. Complex, time-sensitive solutions have been designed to ensure that data is sent, received, and processed correctly.

This project describes how to recognize certain types of human physical activities using acceleration data generated from the ADXL345 accelerometer connected to the Intel® Edison board. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. This project describes how to recognize certain types of human physical activities using acceleration data generated from the ADXL345 accelerometer connected to the Intel® Edison board. Human activity recognition has a wide range of applications especially in wearables. The data collected can be used monitoring patient activity, exercise patterns in athletes, fitness tracking and so on. We will be using support vector machine learning algorithm to achieve this. The project is implemented using the LIBSVM library and done separately in both Python and node.js. The set of activities to be recognized are running, walking, going up/down a flight of stairs and resting. We collect the accelerometer data over a set of intervals, extract the features which in this case are the acceleration values along the x,y and z axes. We then use this data for building a training model that will do the activity classification. The project code can be downloaded from here: Download Hardware Implementation. The diagram below shows the pin connection for the ADXL345 to the Intel® Edison board. Part 1. Python Implementation. Setting up LIBSVM Download the LIBSVM library and transfer the LibSVM zipped folder to the Intel® Edison board root directory using WINSCP. Then extract it by running: tar &ndash;xzf libsvm-3.21.tar.gz Run make in libsvm-3.21 directory Run make in libsvm-3.21/python directory Create the predict-activity.py python script in the libsvm-3.21/python directory Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer import pyupm_adxl345 as adxl345
# Create an I2C accelerometer object
adxl = adxl345.Adxl345(0)
while True:
    adxl.update() # Update the data
    raw = adxl.getRawValues() # Read raw sensor data
    force = adxl.getAcceleration() # Read acceleration force (g)
   
    forceX=format(force[0],'.2f')
    forceY=format(force[1],'.2f')
    forceZ=format(force[2],'.2f')

sleep(2) Classifying the various activities The training file contains instances of the various activities classified as; 0-walking 1-running/jogging 2-up/down staircase 3-resting Below is the screenshot of a small section of the training file Running a grid search to determine the best value for C The parameter C controls the tradeoff between errors of the SVM on training data and margin maximization. C is used during the training phase and says how much outliers are taken into account in calculating Support Vectors. from svmutil import *
import numpy as nu

param = svm_parameter("-q -h 0")
y, x = svm_read_problem('activity.ds')
problem = svm_problem(y[:100], x[:100])
results = []
for c in range(-10,20):
  for g in range(-10,5):
    param.C, param.gamma = 2**c, 2**g
    m = svm_train(problem,param)
    p_lbl, p_acc, p_val = svm_predict(y[100:],x[100:],m)
    results.append([param.C, param.gamma, p_acc[0]])

bestIdx = nu.argmax(nu.array(results)[:,2])

print results[bestIdx] Classifying various user activities #load the LIBSVM shared library:
from svmutil import *
#Construct an svm_problem instance where the activity.ds is the dataset with the training data
y, x = svm_read_problem('activity.ds')
where y is the tuple of labels representing the various activities and x is a tuple of data instances representing acceleration values from x,y and z axes

m = svm_train(y[0:], x[0:], '-c 0.03125 -h 0 -b 1 -q')
#y[0:] and x[0:] means we train the model on the whole dataset array from the first instance[0] to the last
#-h disable shrinking heuristics
#-c : set the cost parameter C of C-SVC
#-q: quiet mode (no outputs)

values=[[float(forceX),float(forceY), float(forceZ)]]
#forceX,forceY and forceZ are data instances of the accelerometer values in x,y,z axes

 p_labels,p_acc,p_values = svm_predict([0]*len(values),values,m])
#pass the accelerometer values for prediction in the svm_predict() method which returns 
#p_labels: a list of predicted labels   p_acc: a tuple including accuracy and p_values: a list of decision values or probability estimates (if '-b 1' is specified)
print p_labels
#output the predicted labels to represent the predicted activity Part 2. Node.Js Implementation Create a new project directory in the board’s home root folder and install node-svm: npm install node-svm Copy the build and lib folder from the node-modules/node-svm to the project directory. Next install the packages required by node-svm by running: npm install <package-name> The packages are Stringify-object, Mout, Graceful-fs, Optimist, Osenv, Numeric, Q and underscore. Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer
var adxl345 = require('jsupm_adxl345');
var adxl = new adxl345.Adxl345(0);

setInterval(function()
{
    adxl.update(); // Update the data
    var raw = adxl.getRawValues(); // Read raw sensor data
    var force = adxl.getAcceleration(); // Read acceleration force (g)
    var rawvalues = raw.getitem(0) + " " + raw.getitem(1) + " " + raw.getitem(2);
    //console.log("Raw Values: " + rawvalues);
    var forceX=force.getitem(0).toFixed(2);
    var forceY=force.getitem(1).toFixed(2);
    var forceZ=force.getitem(2).toFixed(2);

}, 2000); We can now write the code to classify user activity using the value of c we determined from running the grid search using Python in part 1. var so = require('stringify-object');
var svm = require('./lib');
var numeric = require('numeric');
var fs = require('fs');
var fileName = './activity.ds';

//create the classifier
var clf = new svm.CSVC({
    c: 0.03125,
    normalize: false,
    reduce: false,
});

//Build the training model
svm.read(fileName)
    .then(function (dataset) {
        return clf.train(dataset)
            .progress(function (progress) {
                console.log('training progress: %d%', Math.round(progress * 100));
            });
    })
    .spread(function (model, report) {
        console.log('SVM trained. \nReport:\n%s', so(report));
    }).done(function () {
        console.log('done.');
    });

//Classify data instance at some interval
var prediction=clf.predictSync([forceX, forceY, forceZ]);
var probability=clf.predictProbabilitiesSync([forceX, forceY, forceZ]);
console.log(prediction); Summary The project covers how to determine the training parameters of the classifier using a grid search and running the classifier to be able to accurately predict various activities using LIBSVM in both Python and node.js. SVMs require a lot for processing power and memory; the Intel® Edison board delivers effectively on these requirements thus making the project a success. What will you make?

The App Cloud provides a cloud-based IDE for the development of firmware for IoT devices, including collaboration between two or more developers. This firmware can be tested on physical or virtual devices using the Lab Cloud, scaling to your testing needs. Finally, when your IoT device is ready to be deployed, the Device Cloud can be used for secure management and data transfer as well as overall device monitoring as your network of devices scales. Figure 1. The Helix IoT ecosystem. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author created.) Let's explore each of these services, and how they can be used to accelerate your IoT product development. Helix* App Cloud The App Cloud is a fully-featured development environment, built in the context of a web browser. This cloud-based development environment makes IoT firmware development possible anywhere there's a connection to the Internet. Figure 2 shows it running in the Google Chrome browser. Figure 2. Helix* App Cloud browser-based IDE. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author Captured Helix App Cloud Web Site Screenshot) As shown in Figure 2, the App Cloud is exposed as a fully-featured IDE in a web browser, with four panes. On the left is a file pane, showing the files that make up the workspace. At the top middle is the editor, showing a test application (C source file); tabs like the active one make multi-file editing simple and efficient. The right pane shows the debugger (currently executing the test application) with a list of control icons (for pausing execution and single-step debugging), the list of threads that are currently executing, the call stack, and an empty list of breakpoints. Finally, the bottom, middle pane contains a number of tabs for output, including the build tab and the output tab for the currently running application. Where this application executes is a topic for the next section. The power of the App Cloud is not just that you can access an IDE through a web browser anywhere there's an Internet connection. The power is in the IDE's connectivity to other services, such as the Lab Cloud. Helix* Lab Cloud While the App Cloud provides the means to build your IoT application, you'll need hardware (virtual or otherwise) to execute it. This is where the Lab Cloud comes in. The Helix* Lab Cloud is a cloud-based environment for debugging and testing your IoT applications. Using the Lab Cloud, you can attach to physical hardware resources (like the Intel® Edison board) or create and attach to virtual hardware resources. One virtual option is the QEMU x86 Intel® Quark™ simulator, which behaves identically to a physical processor. Your IoT application runs with complete transparency on the virtual platform as if it were a physical one. As a cloud-based service, the Lab Cloud also enables collaboration with other users, sharing physical and lower-cost virtual resources. Once your IoT application has been validated by one or more devices in the Lab Cloud, you can deploy your application to your target device of choice. From Figure 2, you can see a device from the Lab Cloud used for debugging the test application. In the upper right corner, you'll see green text with the name “TestDevice.” This is a virtual Intel® Quark x86 device that is online, as indicated by the green bubble. The debugger pane on the right is attached to this virtual device, as is the output pane connection (middle bottom) receiving console output from the application running on the virtual device. Figure 3 shows the web page for the Lab Cloud, and a short list of the platforms that are supported (hardware and RTOS). Figure 3. Helix Lab Cloud browser interface. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author Captured Helix Lab Cloud Website Screenshot) So far, we've seen how to develop and build our IoT application, as well as test it on physical or virtual devices. Now let's explore the deployment of our IoT devices, and how we can securely manage them in the field. Helix* Device Cloud The scale of IoT deployments can stress the traditional methods for device management. Managing a handful of devices is a trivial task, but once the set expands to hundreds, or hundreds of thousands of devices, more scalable methods are necessary. The Device Cloud is a cloud-based platform that can scale to your particular IoT deployment. It provides you with key capabilities, such as the ability to provision new devices, monitor their operation, manage them for configuration, securely capture data into the cloud, and decommission devices at the end of their lifecycle. The Device Cloud enables secure migration of data from your IoT devices into the cloud using end-to-end encryption for subsequent storage and analytics. It allows the development of rules for incoming telemetry data that can automatically trigger actions such as fault conditions or properties of the device. The Device Cloud also provides manageability and a number of other features, including firmware updates and integration with edge-device RTOS’s (such as Wind River* Linux*) along with health monitoring of devices using RESTful APIs. Additionally, the ability to configure devices in the field is enabled through RESTful APIs. The Device Cloud creates a seamless integration from the edge device into the cloud, allowing you to focus on developing your application, and reducing your overall time-to-market. Key benefits of the Helix* Cloud Accelerate your development with the App Cloud through anywhere and anytime access Provide instant test resource access to your team with the Lab Cloud and build new virtual device configurations on the fly Scale your IoT device deployment with the Device Cloud to provision, configure, monitor, and service Leverage Wind River* embedded operating systems (such as Rocket* and Pulsar*) with full integration with Helix* Cloud services. Leverage Intel® hardware designs for OS integration and seamless connectivity to the Helix Cloud services. Summary The Helix* Cloud provides you with an integrated set of services that cover the product lifecycle, from development and test, to deployment and analytics/monitoring. The Helix Cloud solves the common problems you'll encounter with device management, such as secure data delivery and robust management, allowing you to focus on your IoT application.

These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. The Intel® Edison board is a powerful, new, single-board computer capable of handling broad-spectrum of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from small to reliable industrial projects. Using the JavaScript* framework Cylon.js*, you can control different robotic components easily in a web-based interface. To do so, you need a basic robot kit that has two direct-current (DC) motors controlled and powered only by the board: There’s no need for extra hardware, which makes the project easy to set up. Cylon.js has an easy syntax that helps you understand code without any prior knowledge of programming. It names the components based on their type, and generating commands need to work with the driver you use (for example, for your motor device, you need the turn_on and turn_off commands to make the robot move). This article is meant to help beginners understand the basic requirements for creating wireless controlled robots using the built in Wi-Fi module from the Intel® Edison board. To make sure that the board has enough power to supply the motors and the Wi-Fi module, connect it to a power supply of 7–15 V with 1,000 mA (1.0 A). To upload JavaScript code to the Intel® Edison board, you can use Intel® XDK IoT Edition. For details on how to set up the Intel® Edison board, see Getting started with the Intel® XDK IoT Edition. To upload the code that gives you control of your robot, use the Cylon.js HTTP application programming interface (API). This API is already implemented: You just have to call the function and let Cylon.js handle the rest. Board Setup Based on the robot kit you have (most of them have the same design), you need to make the same connections for both motors: GND - GND (on the Intel® Edison board) VCC - 5 V (on the Intel® Edison board) Forward Digital Pin (IB)* - Pin ~3 (PWM pin on the Intel® Edison board) Backward Digital Pin (IA)* - Pin ~5 (PWM pin on the Intel® Edison board) * The names of the pins can vary based on your robot kit. The pins you must connect to your Intel® Edison board to power the motor are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The pin connections on the Intel® Edison board Note: These pins power a single motor. You must do the same for the second motor, using pins ~6 and ~9 on your board. For this articles, you’ll use a robot kit equipped with two 5-V DC motors and a driver to control each. The motor has two pins to control each direction and two pins for GND and VCC (5-V pin on the board), as shown in Figure 2. It’s easy to find out where the pins go because every motor has the same setup. Figure 2. The four pins you must connect to your Intel® Edison board Controlling the Motors The Cylon.js HTTP API provides a means to control the motors directly from a web browser, making it easy to control the robot. You use a natural language to send commands to the specific pins, which means that you can prototype easily without having to write code. For this step to work, you must find the IP address that the Intel® Edison board uses to connect to your wireless router. For instructions, see Connecting your Intel® Edison board using Wi-Fi. After running the code from your integrated development environment, on the Intel® Edison board you should get the output shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. This output tells you which devices are connected and that the server is running. To control the motors connected to the board, access the corresponding link for the device you plan to control. By using the Cylon.js HTTP API, you can do so by entering the following URLs in your browser’s address bar. They use the names of the devices as listed in the console output in Figure 3, and each corresponds to a pin on the Intel® Edison board: To make the motor go forward, enter this URL: http://edison.local:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_on To make the motor go backward, enter this URL: http://edison.local:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_off. Now, based on your board configuration, you can stop and start the robot and make it move by replacing edison.local with the IP address you get from your board. (In Intel® XDK IoT Edition, you can see the IP address when you uploading the code—for example, 192.168.0.100): http://192.168.0.100:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_on http://192.168.0.100:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_off Summary After learning how to remotely control motors using the Cylon.js framework, you can easily extend your application to command different components by replacing the devices connected to your Intel® Edison board based on the examples from the Cylon.js documentation.

And here's why consumers might care this time. Speedy Thunderbolt ports will take off with next-gen PCs, Intel says 0 Computers by Stephen Shankland August 19, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image "Anything you plug in, it's going support," says Jason Ziller, Intel's Thunderbolt marketing chief. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Intel's long-running but largely unsuccessful effort to transform how you plug devices into your PC will make major progress this year and ultimately conquer much of the industry, the chipmaker predicts. Intel has promoted a connection technology called Thunderbolt for years with few signs of the mainstream success enjoyed by its chief rival, USB. At this week's Intel Developer Forum, though, the company offered two reasons why its high-speed connection technology will soon take off as a better way to hook storage systems, external displays and other peripherals to PCs. First is the arrival this fall of PCs powered by Intel's "Kaby Lake" seventh-generation Core processor. Those machines will include the new USB Type-C multipurpose port. Thunderbolt piggybacks on the same physical design, so it will be easier for PC makers to support Thunderbolt. "We're expecting more than double number of designs," up from 60 Thunderbolt-equipped PCs for sale today, said Jason Ziller, the Intel marketing director who's been the public face of Thunderbolt. "The marriage of USB-C and Thunderbolt is really driving a lot of that adoption." Second is Intel's belief that Thunderbolt will soothe compatibility headaches it expects will crop up with USB-C. Today's USB is pretty predictable, but not all new PCs and devices will support new USB abilities like high-power charging and video. If Intel is right, many more people could benefit as Thunderbolt boosts the usefulness and power of ordinary PCs, for example transforming a mainstream laptop into a powerful gaming system. Enlarge Image A single Thunderbolt cable lets an ordinary laptop use a poweful external graphics card and three external monitors at the Intel Developer Forum.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET If you're not familiar with Thunderbolt, think of it as a beefier version of USB, with faster data-transfer speeds and some extra abilities. But it's also a proprietary technology available only from Intel, not an industry standard like USB that's more likely to spread broadly and to cost less. The new Thunderbolt 3 version doubled its top speed in 2015, and this year Thunderbolt begins using the same physical port and cable connector design as USB-C so you can connect either a USB or Thunderbolt device to a Thunderbolt port. Still, Thunderbolt's overall speed advantage has dropped as USB has gotten dramatically faster in recent years, too, and Thunderbolt is no shoo-in with PC makers. "I've been watching this for six years," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "Every time they roll out a new version they say, 'This is it!' But it never has achieved mainstream status. It's unlikely it will this time as well." Why use Thunderbolt? On a few laptops like Dell's XPS 13 and HP's Spectre, you'll see a lightning-bolt logo next to a connector port. That means you can plug in fast storage systems, multiple high-resolution monitors, fast network adapters and multipurpose docking stations. You can even plug in high-end desktop PC video cards for playing the latest video games, either on external monitors or with better performance on a laptop's own screen. It's all possible due to Thunderbolt's data-transfer speed. At 40 gigabits per second, it's four times faster than the latest and greatest version of USB and enough to copy an entire 100GB 4K movie in 3.2 seconds -- at least in principle. The fastest Thunderbolt 3 drive out there now, the Akitio Thunder3 PCIe SSD, would take 40 seconds to actually read that much data. Tul's Thunderbolt 3 docking station gives a PC four USB 3.0 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, DisplayPort and HDMI video connectors -- and a second Thunderbolt connection to link to other devices. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Thunderbolt devices can be hooked one to another in a "daisy chain," too, so a single port can connect several devices. A Thunderbolt port on a PC can power external devices, up to 15 watts, good enough to run a hard drive, video adapters and network adapters. It will accept up to 100 watts of power so you can charge your laptop, too. Price counts Ziller remains bullish, predicting that ultimately Thunderbolt will ship in more than half of all PCs. Note, however, that in 2012, Ziller hoped "most PCs" would have Thunderbolt by 2015 to 2017. A tiny Intel NUC PC can play high-end games by connecting a hulking desktop graphics card in a Tul Devil Box via a Thunderbolt 3 port. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Many partners are counting on Thunderbolt. More than 100 new devices will arrive in the next six to 12 months using the new Thunderbolt 3 version of the connector, Ziller said. Intel's current Thunderbolt chip, this year's "Alpine Ridge," costs $8.55 for a device maker wanting dual Thunderbolt ports. That may not sound expensive, but it's a full twentieth of the cost a $182 midrange Core i5 processor and fourteenth that of a lower-end $117 Core i3. And PC makers are sensitive to every penny when laptops retail for less than $300. Intel is gradually lowering the costs of these Thunderbolt controller chips, Ziller said, but not as fast as some would like. Cheaper Thunderbolt would spread much faster, said a representative of one device maker at IDF who's eager to sell Thunderbolt products. Intel plans a move that should lower Thunderbolt costs by integrating Thunderbolt into supporting chipsets that computer makers already have to buy alongside a computer's main processor. Chipset integration would mean computer makers essentially get Thunderbolt at no extra cost. "That's in the road map," said Mat Vaughan, a technical marketing engineer, though he declined to say when the integration would happen. Delivering USB-C's promise? The 40Gbps speed is great for gamers with multiple monitors and video editors handling huge files. Now Intel has a Thunderbolt sales pitch for more mainstream computer users, too: It will allay any concerns about what your next PC's USB-C port will be able to do. The back of the HP Spectre has two Thunderbolt ports, right, and a USB port, left. USB devices can be plugged into any of the ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET USB-C can in principle handle high-speed data transfer, video and charging at much higher power levels than earlier USB ports. But there's no guarantee each USB port actually will have all those abilities. For example, Google's Nexus 6P phone still transfers data at the slow rate of a 15-year-old version of the USB standard. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 phone transfers data faster but can't send video to TV. The Thunderbolt logo on a port guarantees all these advanced capabilities are there for both USB and Thunderbolt devices, though. "We affectionately call it 'The USB-C that does it all,'" Ziller said. "From the end-user's perspective, when they see that Thunderbolt port on a computer, it's the worry-free port. Anything you plug in, it's going support."

At its annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF) event in San Francisco, the firm discussed its vision for a 5G world, where mobile networks will be much more than just a technology for making phone calls and will instead serve a bewildering array of devices – such as sensors connected up via the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and other network-enabled infrastructure. “If you look at 5G, we view it as the age of the machines, and everything that enables a fully mobile, connected, intelligent society,” said Asha Keddy, vice-president in Intel's mobile and communications group and general manager of the company's standards and advanced technology team. For this reason, 5G is proving a harder nut to crack than earlier mobile standards, because it will have to serve a wide array of use cases, from connecting billions of small low-power sensors to low-latency streaming of high definition video, to users with tablets or smartphones – and almost certainly some applications that have not been thought of yet. “We don’t know what the future will look like. If you look back to 2G networks, it was all about phones and voice, and then we started having the data revolution. By the time we were rolling out LTE [4G networks], we started requiring things that hadn’t been planned for when LTE was originally designed,” added Keddy. Initially, 5G networks are likely to be made up of multiple wireless technologies, including new air interfaces operating at millimetre wavelengths with data rates measured in gigabits per second, and with the aim of keeping latency down to below 1ms for an end-to-end round trip delay. However, while the exact standards are still a work in progress, AT&T senior vice-president for wireless network architecture Tom Keathley said that he expected to see some early pre-standard deployments as soon as next year, with full roll-outs slated for some time following 2020. Unlike earlier generations of mobile network technology, 5G will be built upon infrastructure making extensive use of technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualisation (NFV), and advanced data analytics. These will be required to enable a service model that can slash the cost of carrying the huge volumes of data that are expected to be generated by billions of connected devices and more widespread use of high-definition video, according to Intel. “One of the things that is important to keep in mind for 5G is that the backhaul network, from the base station back into the core, is already in a transformation, and this is because, as those devices have more and more data passing through them, the network itself has to transform,” said Lynn Comp, director of market development at Intel’s network products group. Not surprisingly, Intel sees this an opportunity, as it has been putting much development effort over the past few years behind SDN and NFV initiatives, as well as working to optimise its processors for handling analytics workloads. But it is not just in the cloud or datacentre, Intel’s traditional area of expertise. The firm is now talking about the need to have intelligence distributed throughout the network, and especially at the network edge, to support some expected use cases for 5G networks. “What you’re seeing is cloud-like capabilities going from the datacentre, into the network and out to the edge, helping to process and add intelligence and insights about what data should go where,” said Comp. The need for this will be driven by applications where a rapid response is called for, according to Intel. For example, when monitoring industrial processes or controlling autonomous vehicles, sending all the data back to a remote datacentre for analysis may simply cause too much of a delay. Having some local analytics capability would be a better solution. If Intel is right, then processing power is not going to be concentrated inside mega datacentres operated by the major cloud providers, but will be spread across the network with base stations and other nodes becoming miniature datacentres in their own right, perhaps caching content locally to cut latency. And naturally, this will also see more Intel chips being sold. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

And here's why consumers might care this time. Speedy Thunderbolt ports will take off with next-gen PCs, Intel says 0 Computers by Stephen Shankland August 19, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image "Anything you plug in, it's going support," says Jason Ziller, Intel's Thunderbolt marketing chief. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Intel's long-running but largely unsuccessful effort to transform how you plug devices into your PC will make major progress this year and ultimately conquer much of the industry, the chipmaker predicts. Intel has promoted a connection technology called Thunderbolt for years with few signs of the mainstream success enjoyed by its chief rival, USB. At this week's Intel Developer Forum, though, the company offered two reasons why its high-speed connection technology will soon take off as a better way to hook storage systems, external displays and other peripherals to PCs. First is the arrival this fall of PCs powered by Intel's "Kaby Lake" seventh-generation Core processor. Those machines will include the new USB Type-C multipurpose port. Thunderbolt piggybacks on the same physical design, so it will be easier for PC makers to support Thunderbolt. "We're expecting more than double number of designs," up from 60 Thunderbolt-equipped PCs for sale today, said Jason Ziller, the Intel marketing director who's been the public face of Thunderbolt. "The marriage of USB-C and Thunderbolt is really driving a lot of that adoption." Second is Intel's belief that Thunderbolt will soothe compatibility headaches it expects will crop up with USB-C. Today's USB is pretty predictable, but not all new PCs and devices will support new USB abilities like high-power charging and video. If Intel is right, many more people could benefit as Thunderbolt boosts the usefulness and power of ordinary PCs, for example transforming a mainstream laptop into a powerful gaming system. Enlarge Image A single Thunderbolt cable lets an ordinary laptop use a poweful external graphics card and three external monitors at the Intel Developer Forum.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET If you're not familiar with Thunderbolt, think of it as a beefier version of USB, with faster data-transfer speeds and some extra abilities. But it's also a proprietary technology available only from Intel, not an industry standard like USB that's more likely to spread broadly and to cost less. The new Thunderbolt 3 version doubled its top speed in 2015, and this year Thunderbolt begins using the same physical port and cable connector design as USB-C so you can connect either a USB or Thunderbolt device to a Thunderbolt port. Still, Thunderbolt's overall speed advantage has dropped as USB has gotten dramatically faster in recent years, too, and Thunderbolt is no shoo-in with PC makers. "I've been watching this for six years," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "Every time they roll out a new version they say, 'This is it!' But it never has achieved mainstream status. It's unlikely it will this time as well." Why use Thunderbolt? On a few laptops like Dell's XPS 13 and HP's Spectre, you'll see a lightning-bolt logo next to a connector port. That means you can plug in fast storage systems, multiple high-resolution monitors, fast network adapters and multipurpose docking stations. You can even plug in high-end desktop PC video cards for playing the latest video games, either on external monitors or with better performance on a laptop's own screen. It's all possible due to Thunderbolt's data-transfer speed. At 40 gigabits per second, it's four times faster than the latest and greatest version of USB and enough to copy an entire 100GB 4K movie in 3.2 seconds -- at least in principle. The fastest Thunderbolt 3 drive out there now, the Akitio Thunder3 PCIe SSD, would take 40 seconds to actually read that much data. Tul's Thunderbolt 3 docking station gives a PC four USB 3.0 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, DisplayPort and HDMI video connectors -- and a second Thunderbolt connection to link to other devices. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Thunderbolt devices can be hooked one to another in a "daisy chain," too, so a single port can connect several devices. A Thunderbolt port on a PC can power external devices, up to 15 watts, good enough to run a hard drive, video adapters and network adapters. It will accept up to 100 watts of power so you can charge your laptop, too. Price counts Ziller remains bullish, predicting that ultimately Thunderbolt will ship in more than half of all PCs. Note, however, that in 2012, Ziller hoped "most PCs" would have Thunderbolt by 2015 to 2017. A tiny Intel NUC PC can play high-end games by connecting a hulking desktop graphics card in a Tul Devil Box via a Thunderbolt 3 port. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Many partners are counting on Thunderbolt. More than 100 new devices will arrive in the next six to 12 months using the new Thunderbolt 3 version of the connector, Ziller said. Intel's current Thunderbolt chip, this year's "Alpine Ridge," costs $8.55 for a device maker wanting dual Thunderbolt ports. That may not sound expensive, but it's a full twentieth of the cost a $182 midrange Core i5 processor and fourteenth that of a lower-end $117 Core i3. And PC makers are sensitive to every penny when laptops retail for less than $300. Intel is gradually lowering the costs of these Thunderbolt controller chips, Ziller said, but not as fast as some would like. Cheaper Thunderbolt would spread much faster, said a representative of one device maker at IDF who's eager to sell Thunderbolt products. Intel plans a move that should lower Thunderbolt costs by integrating Thunderbolt into supporting chipsets that computer makers already have to buy alongside a computer's main processor. Chipset integration would mean computer makers essentially get Thunderbolt at no extra cost. "That's in the road map," said Mat Vaughan, a technical marketing engineer, though he declined to say when the integration would happen. Delivering USB-C's promise? The 40Gbps speed is great for gamers with multiple monitors and video editors handling huge files. Now Intel has a Thunderbolt sales pitch for more mainstream computer users, too: It will allay any concerns about what your next PC's USB-C port will be able to do. The back of the HP Spectre has two Thunderbolt ports, right, and a USB port, left. USB devices can be plugged into any of the ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET USB-C can in principle handle high-speed data transfer, video and charging at much higher power levels than earlier USB ports. But there's no guarantee each USB port actually will have all those abilities. For example, Google's Nexus 6P phone still transfers data at the slow rate of a 15-year-old version of the USB standard. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 phone transfers data faster but can't send video to TV. The Thunderbolt logo on a port guarantees all these advanced capabilities are there for both USB and Thunderbolt devices, though. "We affectionately call it 'The USB-C that does it all,'" Ziller said. "From the end-user's perspective, when they see that Thunderbolt port on a computer, it's the worry-free port. Anything you plug in, it's going support."

The event took place at St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco. CEO AMD Lisa Su unveiled the names of both the CPUs— Summit Ridge and Naples. However, the Gaming PCs and Thin Laptops would feature the former while Data center Servers will exhibit the latter. Their chips will be manufactured under a 14nm Fin Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) process. AMD specified that Summit Ridge CPU will feature 8-core simultaneous multi-threading technology (SMT) to give it a 16-thread processing power. Naples will feature 32-core and 64-threads with SMT, which is similar to Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Hyperthreading. Interestingly, this is the first time AMD aims to cater the high-end gaming PC market as compared to its prior budget-friendly chips. The CEO also claimed that the high-end performance of Zen processors could be a challenge for Intel’s Broadwell-E processor, which is the fastest to date. This would help AMD to compete with Intel and swipe a large chunk of the market share. The Zen chips are expected to be available in 2017— Summit Ridge will release in the first quarter whereas Naples is likely to launch in the subsequent quarter. This can be a leading factor as to why AMD stock price has escalated 82% in second-quarter fiscal 2016 (2QFY16) over blockbuster earnings in 1HFY16. The company’s foray into high-end gaming places is right in the ring with NVidia Corp. and Intel. The semiconductor company is expected to post a loss of 1 cent per share on revenue of $1.21 billion. Such results would reflect a healthy year-over-year (YoY) increment in Advanced Micro Device’s fortunes.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing What to expect when you’re expecting AMD Zen What to expect when you’re expecting AMD Zen By Joel Hruska on August 19, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Last week, the first purported benchmarks of AMD’s upcoming “Zen” microprocessor leaked, giving us an early glimpse of how the chip performs vis-à-vis various Intel products. While the leaks haven’t been confirmed as genuine, it was interesting to see the conversation around Zen and AMD’s expected performance level. Then, at an event on Wednesday, AMD showed some demos of Zen running clock-for-clock against Intel’s 6900K. While these demos were not performed at full speed, they offered some evidence that AMD could match Intel clock-for-clock in certain workloads — and while such demos are always cherry-picked to favor one’s own company, they gave some additional context on what Zen can do. What I want to talk about here has less to do with AMD’s demo or specifics of the architecture and more to do with what AMD needs to deliver to be considered a success. One thing I’ll say up front: I have no secret sources, no hidden informants, and no leaks to credit for what I’m about to write. Agree or disagree, these are my own thoughts and observations. AMD claims that Zen will have 40% better IPC than its previous Excavator architecture and it’s shown demos illustrating how Zen can compete clock-for-clock against the 6900K in some workloads. This is both a solid indication of where the chip currently is and a generalized prediction of where it could end up. The details and specifics will depend on a number of factors including final clock speeds and application-level optimization. What does 40% more IPC mean, anyway? IPC stands for instructions per clock or instructions per cycle (the two terms are synonymous). It’s a metric of CPU efficiency — the higher a CPU’s IPC, the more work that CPU can perform in a given amount of time. There’s typically an inverse relationship between a CPU’s clock speed and its IPC. While IPC has always been used to measure CPU performance, the term became common in enthusiast circles when Intel debuted the original Pentium 4. While the P4 was clocked much higher than its Pentium 3 predecessor, the amount of work it performed per clock cycle was significantly lower. The net result of this was that the Pentium 4 1.5GHz often struggled to outperform the slower Pentium 3 1GHz or its Athlon K7 counterpart from AMD. The most common way to parse AMD’s statement is as follows: If you took an Excavator CPU and a Zen CPU and ran them at the same clock speed, the Zen CPU should be 40% faster, on average, then the AMD CPU it replaces. But even here, there have been questions: Does that 40% IPC improvement include the impact of simultaneous multi-threading (what Intel calls Hyper-Threading) or not? Is that based on two chips clocked at the same frequency or not? Finally and most importantly, which tests were used to derive that figure? IPC isn’t a constant — it fluctuates a great deal based on the behavior of the target application. The benchmark above is from tests I ran when Bulldozer launched nearly five years ago. Despite losing to AMD’s older six-core X6 1100T in multiple benchmarks, the FX-8150 was actually significantly faster in Maxwell Render — one of the few tests it unilaterally won. This kind of variance is normal, which is why it’s so difficult to draw conclusions about relative chip performance based on any single metric. AMD’s claimed 40% IPC uplift should be treated like a general or average prediction and not the guaranteed result of any single test. How will Zen compare with Intel CPUs? The real question, of course, isn’t whether Zen will improve on Carrizo, but whether it’ll give AMD a CPU that can compete with Intel. The realistic answer is “It’ll depend on where you look and what you’re looking for.” Here’s what I mean by that. Compare AMD’s current top-end Piledriver, the FX-9590, against Intel’s Core i7-6700K using Anandtech’s Bench tool. I’ve snipped a section of tests to include below, but you can view the full comparison here. In the graph below, blue is for the FX-9590, while the orange-ish bar is Intel’s Core i7-6700K. Data by Anandtech Assume for a moment that these FX-9590 results actually reflected Excavator performance instead of Piledriver. Now, assume they were 40% faster than they actually are. Would this theoretical top-end chip offer competitive performance with Intel? In some tests, it absolutely would. In other tests, the gap between AMD and Intel is large enough that even a 40% improvement isn’t enough to allow AMD to catch its competitor. Those of you who want to perform this comparison using actual data from Excavator can refer to this AT review of the chip and do the math from there. Either way, the point holds — there are tests where a 40% improvement would absolutely be enough to allow AMD to catch Intel and tests where it wouldn’t be. When we say “It’s going to depend,” it’s not a dodge or an excuse, it’s a fact. AMD’s IDF showcase gave some additional information but not enough to change this basic situation. How do you eat an elephant? One of the common arguments raised in the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark thread was that Zen’s comparatively weak performance compared with the Core i7-6900K is proof that AMD’s eight-core chip won’t be able to compete against Intel. The simple fact that these test results were run on an ES chip of unknown stepping and vintage make that an extremely premature conclusion. Worse, it’s a conclusion founded in an incorrect premise — specifically, that AMD has to match Intel’s top-end performance in order to compete at all. While AMD’s recent demos should assuage some of these fears, the early unveil wasn’t meant to be a complete overview of every aspect of the chip’s performance. Right now, AMD’s FX-8350 is a $160 CPU, while the top-end FX-9590 retails for $229. Intel’s quad-core Core i5 desktop processors start at $185 for older Haswell parts and $190 for Skylake. The cheapest Core i7 you can buy starts at $295 for Haswell and $305 for Skylake (all prices from NewEgg). This means the FX-8350 is priced against a high-end Skylake Core i3 (the Core i3-6320) while the FX-9590 faces off against the Core i5-6600 — a comparatively tiny chip with an integrated GPU and one-third the TDP.   In the 15 years I’ve been reviewing CPUs, the gap between AMD and Intel has never been larger than it is today. That’s part of why Zen is so important, but it’s also why it’s important to keep perspective on what kind of performance improvement AMD can reasonably deliver in a single product cycle. Based on AMD’s single 40% IPC figure, it’s extremely unlikely that the company will deliver a CPU that can match Intel’s performance at every particular and at every price point — and it doesn’t need to. A 40% IPC boost would allow AMD to challenge Intel’s Core i3/i5/i7 line-up by leveraging larger core counts and its own SMT implementation far more effectively than Piledriver ever did. The drastically reduced TDP (Zen has reportedly targeted 95W at the high end) will allow it to compete much more aggressively on power consumption. Higher CPU efficiency means that AMD won’t need to rely on high clocks to hit performance targets, making it easier to push into laptops when Zen-based APUs come to market. Trade-offs between core count and clock speed also mean AMD can probably offer lower core counts at higher clocks, the same way that Intel does. It’s easy to forget, but AMD didn’t launch K7 in 1999 and seize 20% of the server market 12 months later. K7 was competitive with the Pentium 3, but not necessarily faster — particularly since Intel’s Coppermine P3’s ran a full-speed L2 cache while the slot-based K7 and K7.5 used a half-speed or 1/3 speed L2. Socket A and Thunderbird closed this gap in June 2000, but AMD didn’t enter the server market until 2001. It didn’t see serious success in the server market until 2003, when K8 gave it the legs it needed to go head-to-head with Intel’s high-end Xeons. Right now, Intel’s least expensive eight-core processor is the Core i7-5960X, at $1,015. AMD doesn’t need to hit Intel in the $1,000 CPU market to drastically improve its own fortunes or competitive standing. Conclusion Zen will be judged a failure or a success based on how well it performs today and on how well it positions AMD to deliver future improvements. It may not going to be strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Skylake across every SKU and price point, but that’s not what it needs to do. AMD needs Zen to perform well at low power so it can be paired with an APU and slipped into notebooks. It needs Zen to be more efficient than Excavator so Sunnyvale isn’t left pricing eight-core chips against Intel’s Core i3. And it needs Zen to be strong enough that investors and enthusiasts see the core as a future to be built upon, rather than an anchor around the company’s neck. I genuinely don’t know how well AMD will deliver on these goals. But those are the criteria I expect the chip to need to fulfill and the metrics by which I’ll judge its overall position. I’ll have more to say about Zen, including a deep dive into its architecture, when I return next week.

Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Support For Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 August 2016 at 08:02 AM EDT. 9 Comments Earlier this year I heard from an Intel PR representative they had no plans for a Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Linux driver and immediately heard after that from a developer it was bollocks from the media department as usual. Today patches have emerged for supporting Turbo Boost Max 3.0 in the Linux kernel. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is a feature to the Intel Broadwell-E CPUs and presumably more forthcoming high-end CPUs. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is about boosting the frequency of a single CPU core when a single-threaded application is busy on the system occupied. TBM Tech 3.0 is in contrast to Turbo Boost 2.0 that boosts the frequency of all CPU cores when needed for short periods of time. But over the older Turbo Boost tech, TBM 3.0 can maintain its single-boosted-core frequency for a longer duration. Patches published by Srinivas Pandruvada on Tuesday provide support for Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 along with CPUFreq and scheduler changes. TBM 3.0 is disabled by default but can be enabled via sysfs: echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_itmt_enabled. The patches for now can be found on the kernel mailing list and will hopefully be ready for merging into the Linux 4.9 kernel. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel demonstrated a Quark-based "mote" IoT processor at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Aug. 16, 2016. The prototype chip is designed for internet of things applications such as "smart tags" for packages that could report on shipping conditions in real time. Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this The IoT company behind the curtain LTE is hitting the IoT field 5 more tech breakthroughs: Innovations in access, power and control Video Preview: Computerworld's smart cities video tour, coming soon! Tags on a fragile packages may someday be able to say whether the goods are riding safely in the back of a truck or bouncing around in a hazardous way. If Intel follows through on an IoT research project it demonstrated at Intel Developer Forum this week, those tags could report on shipping conditions in real time without needing a battery to stay powered. After the package is delivered, the label might even be disposable. Stephen Lawson Intel demonstrated a prototype "smart tag" for packages at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Aug. 16, 2016. The tag could detect motion and show it on a chart in real time. It’s the kind of IoT that enterprises might not even be aware of as a device or system but could still benefit from every day. Meanwhile, for a shipping company, it might save on labor and specialized technology rollouts. In Intel's demonstration, a real-time graph generated by sensor readings automatically showed a box getting shaken up. Power came from a standard, unlicensed wireless network. The key to this oversharing tag is what Intel calls a mote. It’s a chip so small it could get lost in a jar of coarse-ground pepper. The IA-32 mote shown at IDF, built on Intel's Quark architecture, would be the brains of a tag that could incorporate motion, temperature and other sensors. The tiny size of the processor is a big part of what makes the whole system viable, as it keeps both energy draw and per-chip costs low. The mote doesn’t talk directly to the cloud. Instead, it uses a short-range, low-power network – in this case, Bluetooth Low Energy – to a local gateway device that forwards the data over a longer-range network like cellular. The local gateway might also process or store the data first. The mote is so small and efficient, using only about 1 milliwatt, that it can run on energy harvested from radio waves wafting through the air around it. For example, a Wi-Fi network on a truck might bathe a trailer full of packages with enough RF (radio frequency) energy to power motes on every one of them, Intel researcher Turbo Majumder said. There are other possible power sources for a tiny chip like this. In the mote booth at IDF, Intel displayed a fingertip-sized solar panel that could be paired with it. Harvesting power from motion could also work. But both of those sources would require batteries to keep the mote running and communicating while stationary or in the dark. RF energy harvesting works whenever the radio waves it uses are strong enough. Cell towers dotting the landscape mean RF is almost everywhere, but those kinds of radio waves from a distance usually aren’t powerful enough to power a device like the mote, Majumder said. It’s likely to need a local source, like a truck’s on-board LTE radio or office Wi-Fi.

But if you want to make PCs, that future looks far from rosy. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY SAN FRANCISCO—While we were waiting to get into the AMD Zen press pre-briefing last night, I heard several colleagues (who shall remain nameless) at other publications state aloud a sentiment I had felt but had been uncomfortable expressing: This year's Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was a bit dull. Not that it hasn't generated a fair amount of buzz, mind you. In fact, it felt as if IDF nabbed more attention from those outside this world than it has for a while, primarily thanks to the Project Alloy cordless VR headset that looks as if it will fix one of the biggest flaws with this fascinating emerging technology. And certainly, there was word about a few other major advancements, such as 5G and silicon photonics, that could have a big impact on the world. If you love processors, chipsets, and other hardware of that nature, however, there wasn't a ton for you at IDF. The biggest public acknowledgment of the realm that has traditionally been Intel's bread and butter came in Brian Krzanich's Tuesday keynote address, but it was at best a glancing mention of the future potential of the company's 7th Generation Core (aka "Kaby Lake") processors. If you wanted to dig deep into them, to discover as much as possible about the way they worked, what new graphics and technologies they'd utilize, and so on, you couldn't go to a Technical Session or a panel discussion. I missed that. And, given what I heard from a lot of my friends at the show, I wasn't the only one. This is a feeling I've struggled with for a while, and it seems unlikely to abate anytime soon. When I first became interested in computers in the 1980s, it was because I loved how raw it all was. How, with just a few keystrokes, anyone could write an Integer BASIC program to do, er, basic things, or how, with a bit more effort, you could dig into a game's code and uncover the secrets that, for whatever reason, you could never manage on your own. (After 30-plus years, I think it's safe—if still a little embarrassing—to admit that this is the only way I was able to "win" the original Snooper Troops.) Or how you could pop a new card or a few memory SIMMs into your computer, noodle away at the CONFIG.SYS file for a few minutes (or, uh, hours) and come out with a computer a lot more capable than the one you started with. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY As time passed and I began building my own computers from scratch, I developed a healthy and even stronger respect and curiosity for what underneath made it all possible. This led to my "enthusiast" years, which comprised, among other things, consulting, working in IT, and eventually landing at PCMag.com. It's been an amazing, unusual ride, and one that I've found just as enjoyable as it's been educational. And coming through all that to where we are today, where technology is even more integrated into our lives than I ever could have imagined as a kid—and will only become more so in the years ahead—is undeniably exciting. Like my friends at the show, though, I can't sit through a speech at a show like Intel and not feel a tinge of sadness that this thing I grew up with is either going away or changing so much that it will be beyond most people's grasp. It's already moved into a pretty deep niche, and when major companies place it even further in the background, it's tough not to worry about what sort of life it still has before it. For how many more years will I even be able to build my own computer? For that matter, for how many more years will computers themselves even be things? //Related Articles Intel Lays Out its Vision for a Fully Connected World What can I say: It's hard to give up on your first love. My pulse still skips a beat when I use a powerful new processor for the first time, or plug in an amazing new video card and watch it blow away the last generation's king. That's where my affections lie, because companies like Intel, through their constant innovation and exploration of the possibilities of silicon and dreaming, showed me the wonder inherent in it all and made me want to be a part of it. And there's not a day that I don't wake up at least a little thrilled that I get to be. But just walking around the Moscone Center during IDF dims the lights a little bit. There were plenty of signs and banners emblazoned with words and imagery advertising all sorts of forward-thinking ideas, but very few of which had to do with processor technology (or even hardware at all). Various demo kiosks let you play with drones, robots, and other smart devices, but the brains behind it all always seemed of secondary (or maybe tertiary) importance. The event's slogan even suggested that Intel was looking in a whole new direction: "The Future Is What You MAKE" (capital letters intended). Maybe a future rooted in the Internet of Things won't be so bad; maybe when chips really are everywhere, and in everything, they'll reacquire some of the magical patina they've lost in our public consciousness. I hope so. But if the future is, indeed, what you make, a big part of me still wants to make, and use, computers. Is there a place for me in that bright, fully interconnected future? Only time has the definitive answer, but the one being constantly whispered in my ear from IDF 2016 was not exactly reassuring.

Intel’s roadmap has been laid out at Intel Developer Forum (IDF) this week, though there are still a few hairpin turns to negotiate before the finish line is in sight. Intel believes there will be a 120 million vehicles with varying degrees of autonomous featured on the roads by 2030, though there was little mention of the 2021 target which was mentioned a couple of weeks ago during the partnership announcement with BMW and Mobileye. After the talks at IDF it could suggest the 2021 figure was being used as more of a PR soundbite, geared around the development of standards as opposed to a mass market product. Intel spent significant sums of money on trying to get into the mobile game eventually coming to the conclusion it was not able to compete with the likes of ARM. It would appear the company has matured somewhat following the experience. Instead of investing heavily on the device side of the IoT market, it is prioritizing its expertise; IoT in the data centre. The talks at IDF highlighted the full portfolio Intel has at its disposal, with the team claiming an ‘end-to-end’ technology assets to power the vehicle, communications and the data centre. The key message here is Intel will be able to sufficiently support the demands of storing, sharing and protecting the unprecedented rates of data that will feed deep learning algorithms to train the vehicle. In other news, Uber is also moving up through the gears after announcing it will acquire self-driving start-up Otto. The company, which specializes in self-driving trucks for long-haulage, is currently headed up by Anthony Levandowski who is considered by some to be a pioneer in the autonomous vehicles world. One of his first inventions, a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider, is now in the Smithsonian. Levandowski will now be one of Uber’s top engineers. “Together, we now have one of the strongest autonomous engineering groups in the world; self-driving trucks and cars that are already on the road thanks to Otto and Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh; the practical experience that comes from running ridesharing and delivery services in hundreds of cities; with the data and intelligence that comes from doing 1.2 billion miles on the road every month,” said Travis Kalanick, CEO at Uber. The acquisition also drives Uber into a new market segment; long-distance delivery services. For some, the delivery service industry would be a logical step for Uber, which has rapidly risen to fame over the last few years. While the company has been hitting some speedbumps in recent weeks, it has been forced onto the hard shoulder in China, the success of the brand has not been brought into question. That said, the team still have lofty ambitions, moving into new markets and even decreasing its dependence on third-parties by investing in its own mapping technologies. Alongside the Otto announcement, the team will also partner Volvo Cars to lead a joint project to develop new base vehicles that will be able to incorporate the latest developments in autonomous driving technologies, up to and including fully autonomous driverless cars. As part of the partnership, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, according to Bloomberg. The Uber/Volvo fleet will be at first be supervised by humans in the passenger seat, though this is the first instance of self-driving cars entering into the customers world. Should the initiative run to plan, Uber could be seen on pole position in the self-driving race, though Google and Tesla might have something to say about this in the coming months. The key difference between the three brands who could be seen to be leaders in the field, Uber has not vocalized any intentions to manufacture its own vehicles offering more freedom to collaborate with other manufactures around the world. Both companies will use the same base vehicle in their own individual efforts, while also collaborating on breakthroughs. The new base vehicle will be developed on Volvo modular Scalable Product Architecture (SPA), to further add to the scalability of the SPA platform to include all needed safety, redundancy and new features required to have autonomous vehicles on the road.

AMD CEO Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster shared a few concrete details about the Zen architecture, although no specific CPU models were unveiled. It was also announced that products would not ship before the end of this year as earlier expected. Zen is a completely new architecture, which the company has been working on in the hopes of reclaiming market share lost by its current lineup of FX-series CPUs and A-series APUs, most of which have been underwhelming. AMD has been unable to match Intel at the high end of the performance scale for several years now and has had to cut prices drastically in order to remain an option at the low end. Also, while AMD has not progressed beyond the 28nm fabrication process, Intel has been able to go down to 14nm and was till recently expected to achieve 10nm fabrication this year. The stakes for AMD therefore cannot be overstated.AMD pointed out its successes in the games console market, including the fact that Microsoft will use an AMD processor in its upcoming Xbox One 'Project Scorpio' refresh, as well as the positive reception its new Radeon RX-series graphics cards have had. CEO Lisa Su described the company's current and upcoming offerings as its "most competitive product lineup in a decade". Overall, AMD is claiming that Zen offers 40 percent more performance per clock cycle than its current products. Zen will introduce a number of new techniques and features, starting with a new pipeline with improved branch prediction and a new micro-op cache resulting in improved efficiency in terms of instructions per clock cycle. A typical Zen CPU will have 8MB of shared L3 cache, while each core will have a 512K L2 cache as well as independent L1 caches for data and instructions. The result should be up to 5X better cache bandwidth to a core. AMD is no longer sharing resources between cores, which enables it to offer simultaneous multi-threading more like Intel's Hyper-Threading technique. Each core can execute two threads, both of which appear equal to the OS and software. Zen CPUs will be fabricated by GlobalFoundries on a 14nm 3D FinFET process which should have a significantly positive impact on heat generation and power consumption, allowing AMD to push into thin and light notebooks which have been powered by Intel for years now. Power efficiency has also factored into the design of the architecture, and different blocks will be able to have their power reduced or turned off when they aren't needed. While exact product SKUs, speeds, TDPs, core counts and of course prices were not shared, we do know what form at least some of them will take. The company is using the code name 'Summit Ridge' for at least one 8-core, 16-thread CPU which will be aimed at high-end enthusiasts and gamers. AMD compared a Summit Ridge engineering sample to Intel's top-of-the-line 8-core Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K Extreme Edition CPU at its event, though that particular sample was down-clocked to match the Summit Ridge at 3GHz. The company is claiming equivalent or better performance between architectures, though only one very specific Blender 3D workload was compared. Desktop Zen CPus like the Summit Ridge will require new motherboards and chipsets, which AMD is delivering in the form of the Socket AM4 platform. This is another area in which AMD has lagged, but AM4 will correct that with support for modern IO including PCIe 3.0, NVMe, DDR4 RAM, and 10Gbps USB 3.1. There will also be a server SoC product, codenamed 'Naples', with 32 cores, which will be capable of running in multi-socket configurations. While the mobile and embedded markets were mentioned, no specific products were named. We'll have to wait for more information, though at least some new details could be released as early as next week when AMD presents its Zen architecture at the annual Hot Chips conference. While a resurgent AMD would be great for consumers and for the industry as a whole, there isn't enough information yet to be able to guess how successful Zen might be. The comparison to Intel's latest and greatest architecture is a positive sign, even with only one demonstration in a very specific test with parameters and conditions chosen by AMD itself.

Boasts of scalabiity? Sunshine Navarro19 August, 2016 (Wikimedia Commons)AMD is about to update its list of processors with Zen, which is rumored to boast an advantage over Intel Core processors. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The past few months have seen Advanced Micro Device (AMD) keeping vital information regarding its latest AMD Zen processor under wraps. Nevertheless, talks are rife that the highly anticipated processor will be faster than the Intel Core i5 and boasts of scalability. On Wednesday, PC World conducted an interview with AMD's chief technical officer (CTO) Mark Papermaster after the company's demonstration of the Zen processor. According to Papermaster, the Zen has been in development for not more than four years, and as much as possible, they will try to make its prices competitive with Intel products. He said they "don't want any of that fear, uncertainty, and doubt" on the part of consumers once the AMD Zen is officially released. Papermaster likewise shared that the AMD Zen will scale, which means consumers can get it into a laptop with reasonable power. "It's designed for scalability. The key points I made are twofold: microarchitecture and design methodologies. I showed you this whole history of our prior cores; there was no FinFET. What I showed you was a bigger gap in [our] foundry versus Intel's foundry capabilities. That drove us to really hone the techniques in energy efficiency. We applied all of that to the Zen core design. Then we leveraged FinFET. That combination gives us tremendous scale." Little is known about the AMD Zen as far as specs go. The electronics company is keeping mum about the processor's overall clock performance and speed. However, an engineering sample conducted recently is giving tech savvies an idea how fast and competitive the AMD Zen is compared, particularly, to Intel processors. WCCF Tech reported the benchmark results showing the AMD Zen is indeed faster than the Intel Core i5 processor. Proof of this is the Order Part Number (OPN) of the leaked sample, which is 1D2801A2M88E4_32/28_N. Apparently, this unique identifier of the AMD Zen slyly reveals the base and turbo clocks of the processor. The numbers following the long series of numbers, 32/28, show that the Zen processor boasts of a 3.2 GHz turbo clock and a 2.8 GHz base clock. The AMD Zen's capability to battle it out against Intel Core on a clock-for-clock basis is proof of how impressive and remarkable the Zen processor is. Many tech-savvy consumers are hoping it gets released soon so they can experience its performance firsthand.

We love your deep learning benchmark 'mistakes' 19 Aug 2016 at 10:07, Dan Olds, OrionX Dan Olds, OrionX Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cluster Competition, Cluster, Hpc, High Performance Computing, Nvidia Recent Articles Boffins of the future gear up to build their own beastmode rigs OpenStack brings cloud at the press of a button This week's biggest shock: The race to 200Gbps has been won HPC blog Nvidia just fired the first salvo in what promises to be a classic and long-lived benchmark death match vs Intel. In a webpage titled "Correcting Intel's Deep Learning Benchmark Mistakes," Nvidia claimed that Intel was using outdated GPU benchmark results and non-current hardware comparisons to show off its new Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors. Nvidia called out three Intel claims in particular: "Xeon Phi is 2.3 times faster in training than GPUs." This claim was made in a press presentation delivered at ISC'16 and on an Intel-produced "fact sheet" (PDFs available here and here). It specifically refers to a stat at the left side of slide 12 (and the second page of the fact sheet) where Intel claims Phi is 2.3 times faster on the AlexNet image training on a DNN (deep neural network). Nvidia alleges that Intel is using 18-month-old AlexNet numbers for Nvidia (based on a Maxwell system), while using farm-fresh numbers for the Intel Phi. According to Nvidia, its Pascal processors in the same four-accelerator configuration outperform Intel's Phi by 1.9 times. It also claims its new NVIDIA 8-GPU DGX-1 dedicated DNN training machine can complete AlexNet in two hours, outshining the 4 Phi system by 5.3 times. Ouch. "Xeon Phi offers 38 per cent better scaling than GPUs across nodes." This claim also occurs in both of the Intel documents referenced above. In this case, Intel is saying that their Phi systems scale better than GPU-equipped boxes, namely when it comes to 32-way/accelerator configurations. According to Nvidia, Intel is using four-year-old numbers from Oak Ridge's Titan machine, which was using the old Jaguar interconnect and old K20 GPUs, as a comparison to Intel's brand-new Omni Path Architecture connected Phi processors running deep learning workloads. It points out Baidu-published specs from its speech training workload that show near linear GPU scaling not just to 32 nodes, but to 128 nodes. Ouch again. "Xeon Phi delivers 50 times scaling on 128 nodes." I didn't see this exact claim in the Intel documents, but there were a lot of claims flying around, so I could have missed it. Whether it's there or not, Nvidia responded to it by again pointing to the near-linear Baidu 128-GPU node result. By the by, getting a 50 times speed up by adding 128 times more resources isn't the kind of scalability you write home about, you know? What's funny to me is that at the end of Nvidia's "correction" webpage, it welcomes Intel to the era of AI, with an additional admonition that "they should get their facts straight." Hmmm. But I'd like to see something more along the lines of the old, and unpublished, Data General ad where they are welcoming IBM to the minicomputer market. The two-line ad read: "They say that IBM's Entry Into Minicomputers Will Legitimize the Market ... The Bastards Say, Welcome." As the budding Intel-Nvidia war develops, we're sure to see shots flying back and forth – maybe we'll even see an Informix-Oracle-like billboard fight like we did in the 1990s? The Highway 101 billboard owners should start writing their proposals now... ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 6 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel's reveals silicon photonics module for data centres By Anthony Spadafora Shares In order to speed up the way in which data is moved across data centres, Intel has revealed a new silicon photonics product that will be able to move data at much greater speeds than currently possible. The company's new PSM4 silicon photonics module will be able to deliver 100 gigabits per second across a range of two kilometres. This will enable data to be shared at higher speeds across data centres. Intel has been working for years to combine electronics and optical components onto a single piece of silicon as this will simplify both the production process and at the same time will lower its manufacturing costs. The PSM4 was revealed at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco by executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group Diane Bryant. Bryant acknowledged the work that Intel has put into developing this new module, saying: “Electrons running over network cables won't cut it. Intel has been working on silicon photonics over 16 years. We are the first to light up silicon.” This new technology is quite different than other ways of delivering data which often rely on optical technology. However, optical is more difficult to manufacture and is much more expensive to produce than products created using silicon. Intel's PSM4 silicon photonics module uses a hybrid laser to achieve its high data transfer speeds. Bryant also pointed out that data centre traffic is doubling every 12 months due to increased demand as more and more businesses have shifted to the cloud. Intel is working on more than connecting servers via optics and Bryant noted that eventually “optics will be required into the server as well”.

Looks like the Wintel club is back with the two companies announcing they will collaborate on a "mixed-reality platform" for Windows 10. Remember the good old days of counting processor frequencies and, well, blue screens? Looks like the Wintel club is back with the two companies--Microsoft and Intel--announcing that they will collaborate on a "mixed-reality platform" for Windows 10. That effort supported by new depth-sensing cameras from Intel injected excitement into the keynote at the annual Intel Developer Forum here, but fell short of defining a new Wintel platform of the magnitude of the declining PC. Project Alloy Intel will contribute a wireless head-mounted display to the effort, making its hardware and software freely available late next year. Project Alloy uses Intel’s RealSense 3D cameras to enable users to move with six degrees of freedom and use their hands to control virtual spaces. In a demo of Alloy, a user walked among virtual rooms. Typical of the state of such systems, the user had difficulty at one point pushing a large virtual button with hands that often appeared pixelated. However, later he was able to use his finger as a tool to shape a virtual object turning on a virtual lathe. At an event in Shenzhen in December, Microsoft will release the specification for the Win 10 mixed-reality platform. Updates to the operating system next year will let all Windows 10 PCs run what it calls holographic applications for its HoloLens headset. Microsoft and Intel share a common vision of mixed virtual and augmented reality systems as a key direction for client computing, said Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. Krzanich: Intel will make the Project Alloy headset available as open source next year. (Image: EE Times) “We think this is going to be big because it’s so different than anything that’s out there today,” said Krzanich, noting the Intel headset doesn’t require a room to be outfitted with sensors. “Since the introduction of the PC nothing has so fundamentally redefined computing. VR has gone mainstream in a fundamental shift in how we work play and communicate,” he said.   Next: Injecting Realsense into products » Tech Watch Intel Microsoft Processors/Controllers Computing Consumer Electronics Embedded Systems Communications CMOS electronics, Si-photonics integration targets 1Tb/s Interviews Virtual reality: A killer app in more ways than one Automotive Laser beam steering targets scanning LIDAR systems IoT Transceiver operates in unlicensed sub-1GHz band Computing Machine learning may be Intel’s critical inflection point Back to Top Connect with us Facebook Twitter Get quick access News & Trends Photo Gallery Blogs Video Tutorials Webinars PDF Downloads Vendor Resource Centres Archived Technical Articles Archived Blogs Contact Us Visit our network sites Mainland China EET China EDN China ESM China Robotics China China Technology Forums DatasheetsChina.com Taiwan EE Times Taiwan EDN Taiwan Rest of Asia EE Times Asia EE Times India EE Times Japan EDN Asia EDN Japan US & Europe EE Times US EE Times Europe EDN US Datasheets.com Copyright © 2016 eMedia Asia Ltd.

Now while the smartphones will start selling in India by the end of this month, the ZenBook 3 will only arrive here in Q4. The ZenBook 3 is priced at Rs 1,47,999 which makes it a laptop to consider for a niche audience who want the absolute best internal components while having a light and portable form factor. The Zenbook 3 looks quite elegant in terms of design. It comes in three colours – Royal Blue, Rose Gold and Quartz Grey – each of which has a golden coloured chamfering going around the edges. The keypad covers the entire horizontal length when you open the flap, and the speaker section is present just above the keyboard. The track pad which comes with a layer of glass, comes in two variants – one is a plain trackpad and the higher end one comes with a fingerprint scanner for one-touch login. The keypad was quite responsive and offers a decent amount of travel. Asus has also managed to put in a 3mm fan under the hood to ensure that the temperatures of the Intel Core processors remain under check. If there was one thing we did not like, then it was the presence of just a single USB Type C port. Specially considering this ultrabook comes with full desktop-class graphics. Unless Asus is planning to bundle a boat load of accessories for free with the Zenbook 3, it still carries forth the same major flaw that has been there in the Macbook as well. We are still way too dependent on things such as an extra USB port for mouse and an SD card slot for transferring photos from your digital cameras (not all cameras out there are Wi-fi enabled) and so on. Considering we are seeing a lot of premium laptops in a slim form factor off late, we decided to compare the ZenBook 3 with the HP Spectre and Dell XPS 13 which are high performance slim form factor Windows 10 based laptops. We also added the Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Retina Display) to the mix as it makes a lot more sense than the Intel Core m series sporting Apple MacBook which is more closer in form factor to the ZenBook 3. Asus ZenBook 3 HP Spectre Dell XPS 13 Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Retina Display) Price Rs 1,47,999 Rs 1,19,900 Rs 1,35,990 Rs 1,46,900 Weight 0.91 kg 1.11 kg 1.29 kg 1.58 kg Dimensions 296 x 191.2 x 11.9 mm 32 x 229 x 10.4 mm 304 x 200 x 15 mm 314 x 219 x 18 mm Processor Intel Core i7 7500U Intel Core i7 6500U Intel Core i7 6560U 5th gen Intel Core i5 RAM 16GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 Graphics Intel HD Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 6100 Display Size 12.5-inch LED backlit LCD 13.3-inch LED backlit LCD 13.3-inch InfinityEdge touch 13.3-inch LED backlight LCD with IPS panel Display Resolution 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 3200 x 1800 2560 x 1600 Storage 512GB PCIe SSD 512GB PCIe SSD 256GB PCIe SSD 512GB PCIe SSD Ports 1x audio jack, 1x USB Type C 3x USB Type C, 1x audio jack 2x USB 3.0, 1x USB Type C, 1x SD card slot 2x Thunderbolt 2 ports, 2x USB 3.0, 1x audio jack, 1x SDXC card slot, 1x HDMI port Operating System Windows 10 Home / Pro Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home OS X El Capitan Battery 40WHr 38WHr 56WHr 74.9WHr The one immediate advantage that the ZenBook 3 has over competition is the presence of the latest 7th generation Intel Core i7 processor and it comes with 16GB of RAM which is double that found in all its competitors. At 910 grams, the ZenBook 3 is also the lightest notebook in the list. The thinnest laptop however is the HP Spectre which has created quite a buzz since its launch, for the slim form factor. HP has also managed to cram in an Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD. It offers a 13.3-inch full HD form factor which is a more traditional size. But it has the lowest battery capacity among the others, which could be a matter of concern. The Dell XPS and the MacBook Pro offer high resolution displays which certainly gives them an edge. The Dell XPS 13 with its InfiniteEdge display offers a unique proposition. The MacBook Pro offers the highest battery capacity, and has many more ports for the working professional as compared to other laptops. Technically, the MacBook should have been in this list since it offers similar form factor and weight, but since it is based on the Intel Core m platform, it would have been a bit unfair to compare it with the ZenBook 3 which is much more powerful. Barring the ZenBook 3, all the other laptops are currently selling in India. While the MacBook Pro 13-inch has been a proven consistent player, the real interesting battle is between the three Windows 10 laptops. At such thin form factors, heat management becomes a prime area of concern. Specially so, when you consider that these laptops house an Intel Core i7 processor inside. So it would be quite difficult to gauge which laptop is better than the other just based on looking at the specifications. We will need to do thorough testing of all the laptops and compare not just benchmark scores, but take a look at heat management and battery life of these laptops. The Dell XPS 13 is already being tested as we write this, so its review should be out soon. Do check back for the full review. Asus has not yet given the exact launch date for the ZenBook 3, so we will have to wait till the end of the year for that. In that time gap, if HP Spectre, Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro 13.3-inch get a price drop, then it will make things that much more difficult for the ZenBook 3, unless it offers mind-blowing performance. We will have to reserve our verdict till then.

It OC well but not so much lol .. even under "chilled water " ( 4930K 6 cores run at 3.9ghz stock ( turbo clock ofc ))... meaning i should pretty easely hit 5.8-6ghz if i follow your 50% OC ) ... I dont see much peoples running around with even quad core at 5.7+ ghz 24/24 . lol Last edited by Lane; 08-18-2016 at 20:48.     Lane View Public Profile Find all posts by Lane     (#30) Clouseau Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI HD6950 Twin Frozr III Processor: Phenom II x4 940BE Mainboard: ASUS M3A32-MVP WiFi Memory: GSkill Pi-Black 4x2GB Soundcard: PSU: Antec HCP 1200 08-18-2016, 21:03 | posts: 1,354 Quote: Going with what you Said, you must be 10 years old at most.

There are exceptions both up or down, but I believe that there is a ceiling for Intel designs at least. I would expect the 8/16 Zen to be at around 3.8-.4.2GHz. If the IPC is indeed better than Broadwell-E, the platform is compelling and the prices are "right", AMD will have a winner.     PrMinisterGR View Public Profile Find all posts by PrMinisterGR   (#33) jura11 Maha Guru     Videocard: Titan X SC GTX 1080 AMP!

Offering i5/7 6600~6900(K) performance a for a bit less than Intel's counterpart is great in theory but the installation basis of those intel CPUs in the respective segments may be far too large already to do any good to AMD. It may be interesting to 2500/3570 owners that didn't make the jump yet but AMD has likely to do a bit better than merely taking a few bucks off the price tag to warrant a whole platform change.     moeppel View Public Profile Find all posts by moeppel   (#49) Ryu5uzaku Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980ti gaming 1490/7700 Processor: 3770K @ 4.4 stock voltage Mainboard: z68 crap Memory: 16GB Soundcard: Meridian 2G PSU: 850W SF platinum 08-19-2016, 08:24 | posts: 6,208 | Location: Finland If Zen indeed does beat broadwell-e it will be worth the investment from me.

AMD will be doubling the CPU thread count, stepping up against Intel's HyperThreading technology with the new Zen-based range of processors. There's also a high bandwidth and low latency caching system that will be used to "feed the beast", thanks to the 14nm process we're looking at greater power efficiency and a nice speed boost of 40% more instructions per clock (IPC).   If you don't think the 40% increase in IPC is real, Ryan Shrout from PCPer says "AMD proved to me today that the claims are real and that we will see the immediate impact of that architecture bump from day one". I've been hearing internal rumblings that Zen is underpromised right now, and will have even more performance - and now that Shrout has had AMD prove the performance of Zen to him, my excitement meter has just shifted further into 'please, can I have it now'.   There are some big changes to the Zen architecture, with branch prediction completely overhauled, and this is the first AMD processor to feature micro-op cache. Shrout adds: "Wider execution width with broader instruction schedulers are integrated, all of which adds up to much higher instruction level parallelism to improve single threaded performance".     AMD has used an integrated 8MB of L3 cache, with prefetching improved with up to 5x the cache bandwidth per CPU core. SMT is there to make sure the pipeline is filled, where "bubbles" that latency arrives in and lower efficiency are prevented, while AMD has also used region-specific power gating that will see Zen-powered notebooks be very powerful, and power efficient, too.   AMD was comparing its new 8-core, 16-thread "Summit Ridge" processor against Intel's ridiculously expensive 8-core/16-thread "Broadwell-E" processor - the Core i7-6900K. AMD compared the IPC improvements of Zen, by using a rendering workload that finished 1-2 seconds faster than the 6900K. Impressive stuff.   There's no pricing information or finalized clock speeds just yet, but it looks like we can begin to get genuinely excited about AMD processors again.

We’re just not sure the Z83 can compete in it." Price $247 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel Atom x5-Z8300 1.4GHz • Intel HD Graphics • 2GB RAM• 32GB • Windows 10 Home • 802.11ac Wi-Fi, SD expansion slot • 2x USB 2.0 • USB 3.0 • HDMI, 3.5mm audio Tweet Email this Print this Feedback If another nano-PC is released in a forest of nano-PCs... does anyone notice? Our somewhat qualified appreciation of the Intel Compute Stick - the teeny PC that looks like a big thumb drive with an HDMI plug instead of a USB - was documented recently (PCTA 221, p57). We liked the device, but pointed out the Atom x5-Z8300 CPU and 2GB of RAM limited its uses somewhat. What also limits the flexibility of the Compute Stick is the form-factor itself. There’s only room for two USB ports and one micro-SD slot. And for networking, it relies entirely on Wi-Fi or (*shudder*) a USB-to-Ethernet dongle. However, thanks to an odd website called gearbest.com where everything is always on sale but the sale is always in its last hours, you can now get this: The Mini PC Z83. Or possibly Z83 Mini PC, or Z83 TV Box Intel Atom, the nomenclature isn’t 100% clear. Cheekily packaged in a plain brown box with almost-but-not-quite-Intel-official fonts and graphic design elements, the Z83 is the size of two packs of cards sitting side-by-side. Like the Compute Stick, it uses the x5-Z8300 1.4GHz Atom, it has 2GB of DDR3 RAM, and an included license of Windows 10 Home takes up about a third of its 32GB internal storage.  But unlike the Compute Stick, the Z83 rocks three USB ports (still only one USB3.0 though), a full-sized SD card slot, a headphone jack and a full-sized Ethernet port. Perhaps more significantly, it’s passively cooled so there’s no irritating little fan waiting to spin up during a tense dramatic moment. That’s assuming you’re using this thing as some kind of HTPC, because it does come with a back-of-the-TV-or-monitor mounting bracket. Apart from those form-factor differences though, the spec of the Z83 is so similar to the Compute Stick, we wondered if it WAS one, just in a bigger box. So out came the spudgers and teeny screwdrivers, and we discovered that in fact the box isn’t just for show: this machine sits on a much larger PCB than Intel’s teeny pooter, and has a nice big heatsink covering the CPU and memory. The heatsink appears copper but is actually just aluminium painted copper. That kind of defines the build-quality of the Z83 through and through. It’s not terrible, but it’s not exactly premium either.  It is very carefully designed to look like an official Intel product though, and it isn’t. Don’t let ‘em fool you! "this machine sits on a much larger PCB than Intel’s teeny  pooter ,  and has a nice big heatsink covering the CPU and memory." With two USB2.0 ports on one side and one USB3.0 on the other, the Z83 is reasonably flexible. You can attach both a wired mouse and keyboard directly, leaving the USB3.0 port free.  The 3.5mm audio jack is a slightly baffling inclusion since the only video output is HDMI (which carries audio of course) but it does give speaker options should you decide to use this little machine as a desktop. Like so many of these atom-based mini-machines, the Z83 sacrifices a sizeable chunk of its 32GB onboard storage to Windows 10 Home. Which runs okay. It would be interesting to know what the price-break is that means these PCs all have 2GB RAM rather than 4GB. Even my smartphone has 4GB of RAM.  Like the Compute Stick, the Z83’s biggest competition is the Google Chromecast and the Apple TV... not to mention the apps on all modern TVs (which suck, but at the palatable price of “free with the TV”). Both TV boxes from the tech giants are getting more and more capable and surely can’t be far from releasing 4K versions. They’re seamlessly supported with your preferred smartphone, and the Chromecast is just $59.  An Apple TV will set you back $269 these days which is kind of insane, but maybe you’re one of the very specific group of people who reject Apple on pricing grounds, but also Google on... tax avoidance grounds? I dunno. Gearbest advertises the Z83 as having a regular price of $247, which is too much. But it also seems to be perennially on sale for $119 (with a European plug) which is almost tempting. That’s not much money at all for a “full” PC with enough graphical grunt to run a desktop, 1980s and 1990s videogame emulators, and full HD video in any format you can convince Windows to decode. Like the Compute Stick, the 2GB of RAM holds it back. But the Z83 is cheaper and more flexible. And there’s no fan. We place a pretty high value on silence. But here’s the kicker. The Z83 is one of dozens of new teeny-PCs. They’re all about the same size (deck of cards) and some even run Android. There’s even a super-sexy silver unit called a VOYO V2 that has 64GB of storage, a 5000mAh battery, and claims 4K output... for  $150.  It’s a weird new world. We’re just not sure the Z83 can compete in it.   Product link: http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_343636.html     This Review appeared in the July 2016 issue of PC & Tech Authority Magazine Related Reviews Review: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 Xtreme Gaming Review: Fitbit Flex 2 keeps you fit without hurting your wallet Review: Dell XPS 8910 Mini-Tower desktop PC Review: the HP Spectre couldn't be any more lux if it tried Review: Sony MDR-1000X headphones Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today With rampant rumors circulating that Microsoft is going to launch a new Surface Book 2 along with Surface Pro 5,  fans could no longer wait for it to happen. However, they may have to wait for a few more months as reports are consistent that both laptops will arrive in early 2017. What's even more interesting is that the new Surface Book 2 will carry a different design from its predecessor. Apart from the cosmetic upgrades, the upcoming laptop is also expected to sport advanced specs and features. It has been reported that Microsoft Surface Book 2 will become one of the first devices to run on the upcoming Intel seventh generation core processor, the Kaby Lake. The powerful chipset is expected to support 3D and 4K display, which will eventually become one of the highlights of the Surface Book 2. Another feature that will be supported by the new Intel processor is virtual reality or VR. If rumors prove to be true, Microsoft will certainly build the next Surface Book laptop around Intel's Kaby Lake processor. According to Windows Central, one of the design changes of Microsoft Surface Book 2 is its hinges. According to the publication, the company will close the gap in its hinges to give it a better look compared to the original Surface Book. In a report by the BitBag, the upcoming laptop will carry 16 GB of RAM, which will be paired with its powerful processor. It will also house up to 1 TB of internal storage capacity. Just like the Surface Pro 5, the Surface Book 2 is also rumored to feature a USB Type-C connectors and ThunderBolt 3 ports. Meanwhile, according to CIO, the upcoming machine will be sold between $900 and $1500. However, this information has yet to be confirmed by Microsoft.

Contact Newsletter SUBSCRIBE   previous Star Citizen Gamescom 2016 gameplay shown off    random   next Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Season Pass detailed  No Man’s Sky PC patches detailed Tons of fixes by Mikhail Madnani on August 20, 2016   After a rocky launch, Hello Games have issued patches on PC and have finally detailed the patches in a post on Steam Community. The patch notes are as follows and Hello Games claims this fixes 70% of the issues reported: Patch 1 The focus of patch 1 was to add greater support for more hardware. Either specific hardware configs, or hardware outside our min spec. We want as many people to be able to play as possible, and these were our most reported issues. AMD Phenom Support Game is now confirmed working on Phenom CPUs. Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten to support AMD CPUs. The game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics has also now created new libs for us to add Phenom support. Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved. On CPUs with exactly 8 threads, performance has also been significantly improved. Framerate Stuttering due to Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on. This is particularly true on ATI cards. Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been fixed. Radeon 6xxx Added support for this GPU, which doesn’t support OpenGL 4.5 fully. Save Corruption Solution to try to prevent saves getting corrupted no matter what’s going on in background processes (see Patch 3 below, where we also are attempting to recover corrupted saves). Intel GPU Detection We do not currently support Intel GPUS. We are working on this for a future patch, to expand our min spec. In the meantime, the game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high end GPU has not been selected. Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users Mouse Smoothing Generally this is most helpful for players with sub-30 FPS. Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in “Mouse Smoothing”. It defaults to off. If you feel micro stutters in framerate affecting controls, feel free to turn this up. If you feel the framerate is “slow” or “lumpy”, please make sure that this is turned off Patch 2 For patch 2 our focus was on the most reported bugs or crashes. Our aim was to improve stability, and make sure player’s saves are safe in future. Stuck under the world It was possible for players to save their game stuck under the terrain, leaving them stuck. This was caused by getting shot down in atmosphere, and their ship reaching ridiculous speeds as it crashed to the planet. This has been resolved. Whilst it won’t happen anymore, if you are currently already stuck under the world, we detect this and do our best to rescue you. Crash after warping Occasionally at random the game would lock up after a warp, or return to desktop. This was due to very specific timing in hardware (a threading specific bug) – meaning that unfortunately for some people it was regular, and for others they would never be able to recreate it. This was our most reported crash during gameplay, and has now been resolved. Game failing to save until you died If the player died, and then loaded the game ten times without saving, and then died, player progress wouldn’t be saved from then on until you died again. This is fixed now! This was also causing player’s saves to grow in size. Crash fixes in scanning Quite a rare crash, but in certain scenarios it was possible to scan from space or on planet and crash the game. Crash warping inside a freighter When warping into a battle sometimes the player warped into the inside of a freighter and everything went crazy This is fixed now. Patch 3 Patch 3 is targeted at our next most common support requests, fixing the next most common crashes, as well as trying to help players who have become stranded or have corrupted their save files. Stranded in Space Station If you died in your ship while in atmosphere of a planet with a damaged ship, you could respawn in a space station with your launch thrusters and pulse engine damaged. If you did not have the resources to fix them then you could no longer take off and be stuck there. This will no longer happen. Loading Corrupted Save Files Some players have corrupted save files, we’ve been working with them to still load saves even if they are corrupted (this can happen for many reasons outside of the games control). This fix has allowed many players to still load their save even if they have become corrupt on PC. Crash fixes for next three most commonly reported issues: - As the player gathers a huge amount of discoveries, there was a threading issue that becomes more prevalent the more discoveries you have, and could cause the game to crash. - If you had collected a large number of blueprints, in a specific order it was possible to crash the game when you received a new blueprint. This has been fixed. - Players who set a large number of waypoints could find themselves in a situation where they could crash the game in the Galactic Map, this is remedied now (PS. A better waypoint system is coming). No word on the release notes for the latest PlayStation 4 patch as of this writing. There was a 600mb update to the PS4 version yesterday. No Man’s Sky is available on PlayStation 4 and PC. More information is available on Steam Community.

Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:07AM Image source: Getty Images. We Fools believe that the stock market is largely rational and prices stocks appropriately the vast majority of the time, but that doesn't mean that it's always correct. Sometimes the markets may be overly bullish or bearish for any number of reasons, and if you can take an alternative stance and be proven correct, then you can be in a position to make a killing. With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors are sharing the one stock that they think the market is pricing incorrectly. Read on to see which stocks they picked and why they believe that the market's assessment is wrong. This specialty retailer isn't dying -- it's growing! Brian Feroldi: Short-sellers, or investors who bet against stocks, have placed a target on the back of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). Currently more than 31% of the company's shares have been sold short, which indicates that many believe that this company's future is looking bleak. At first glance it's easy to understand why so many have adopted that viewpoint. With the rise of smartphones and digital games, it's not hard to predict that the company's core business is going to be under a lot of pressure into the future. Image source: GameStop. I thought so, too, but once I started to look under the hood I realized there are plenty of reasons to believe that the market is wrong. First, let's get the bad news out of the way. Yes, the company's physical game business is expected to continue to decline from here, but at a far slower rate than you might otherwise believe. Management is only forecasting a 6% annualized decline over the next few years.  Before you smirk at that claim, it's worth pointing out that cutting-edge video games require a huge amount of storage capacity. The average PS4 or Xbox One video game takes up 40 gigabytes of storage space, which is a big reason why digital penetration in video games is only about 20% (versus 50% for music).  In addition, physical games can be resold in GameStop's stores, allowing the customer to recoup some cash. You can't do that with digital downloads, so those two factors should help to slow the overall decline. But GameStop isn't simply sitting still, as it has numerous growth opportunities in place that will help to offset that decline. For one, the company is using the shift to digital games as a catalyst for growth. GameStop currently rings up more than $1 billion in sales for digital games, up a huge 263% from 2010.  GameStop is also pushing into the collectible space by offering game-related apparel, gadgets, toys, and more at its stores. Sales are expected to be $500 million in 2015, and the company has aspirations to reach $1 billion in sales by 2020. There's also the company's Spring Mobile and Simply Mac concepts, which sell products from AT&T and Apple. Sales from these stores are fast approaching a billion dollars, with more to come in the years ahead. Add it all up, and management is projecting operating earnings growth of 3% to 5% annually from here. The numbers look even better on the bottom line when you consider the effects of share repurchases, as recent history has shown that the company has had success at taking down its share count. GME Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Believe it or not, even analysts agree that this strategy is going to work. The company is projected to grow its EPS by more than 8% over the next five years. With shares trading for only 8 times trailing earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 4.7%, I can't help but think the shorts have bet against the wrong company. Don't count your chickens before they hatch Tim Green: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged a mesmerizing 320% over the past year, providing those betting on a turnaround with an incredible gain. The company has already launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards, meant to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and it plans to release its upcoming Zen CPUs next year. Following years of share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, investors are banking on Zen to right the ship. The first tangible signs of a turnaround surfaced when AMD reported its second-quarter results. The company managed to grow revenue year over year, and while AMD still posted a significant net loss, margins improved. The bull case that has been driving the stock higher over the past year is simple: Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to win back market share from NVIDIA and Intel, heralding in a new era of growth and profitability for the company. The bear case is also simple, especially following the stock's massive gains over the past year: Both Polaris and Zen will face plenty of competition, and significant market share gains are far from guaranteed. NVIDIA has already launched the GTX 1060, a mainstream competitor to AMD's RX 480, and competitive lower-end cards from NVIDIA are likely later this year. And Intel, which has a near monopoly in the server CPU market, outspends AMD on R&D by a factor of 13. It's certainly not impossible for AMD to stage a triumphant comeback, but I think the market is getting way ahead of itself. The market is missing a growth story at this century-old Rust Belt icon John Rosevear: Here are two charts for your consideration. The first shows General Motors' (NYSE:GM) operating profit margin, excluding special items, in every quarter since the beginning of 2014. (Yes, General Motors. Bear with me here, it's a good story.)  Chart shows quarterly EBIT-adjusted profit margin as reported by GM. Data source: General Motors. Second, here's how GM's stock price has performed over the same period. GM data by YCharts. Interesting, no? Full disclosure: I did cheat somewhat by choosing a cherry-picked time period. GM's margin in the first half of 2014 were clobbered by the costs of its ignition-switch recall mess, so the slope of the increase looks particularly dramatic. But I only cheated a little: The trend overall has been upward since GM's first post-IPO quarter in 2012, when its margin was around 5.8%. In fact, last quarter's 9.3% margin was a record. It's not a fluke, either: CEO Mary Barra is driving a series of long-term initiatives (learn more about them here) that are intended to put GM's margin into the 9% to 10% range sustainably by early next decade. There may well turn out to be a sizable increase in revenue (and therefore profits) along the way, too.  Image source: GM. It's true that GM was the poster child of the bad old days of Detroit. But that GM is long gone: Over the last few years, GM's quality ratings have skyrocketed, it has emerged as a leader in electric cars and self-driving technology, and it has become much more shareholder-friendly. What do I mean? Old GM talked about market share and its long-gone glory days as the world's largest-selling automaker, while ignoring the advances made by its rivals. Barra and her team talk about return on invested capital, about returning excess cash to shareholders, about out-disrupting Silicon Valley, and about becoming the world's most profitable automaker. It's a great story that much of Wall Street seems to be overlooking. The upshot is that right now, GM is dirt cheap: It's trading at just 4 times trailing-12-month earnings, with a dividend yield of almost 4.7%. (Read why that dividend is probably sustainable through a recession.)  Investors are worried about a near-term slowdown in the U.S. new-car market, but GM's longer-term prospects are very bright. For a patient investor, this one's worth a close look.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple. Like this article?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 19, 2016 at 5:23PM Intel's new chip-development methodology. Image credit: Intel.  Last year, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released products based on its Skylake architecture for desktop systems. Skylake represented a brand-new architecture manufactured in the company's then-new 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. Although the lineup of Skylake-based desktop processors consisted of a wide range of products, perhaps the two most interesting parts were the Core i5-6600K and Core i7-6700K, targeted at gaming PCs -- a sub-segment of the PC market that, according to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, "continues to grow at a double-digit rate." According to a leak via Chinese website coolaler.com, the company's gaming-PC-oriented processors based on its upcoming Kaby Lake architecture should pack quite a punch. Solid boost in clock frequencies The prior-generation 6600K ran at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 3.9GHz. The higher-end 6700K came at 4GHz base and a maximum turbo speed of 4.2GHz. The 6700K wound up faster than the 22-nanometer Core i7-4790K that it replaced as a result of greater performance per clock (that is, the new chip family can do more work at a given frequency than the prior-generation one). However, it's worth noting that the 4790K actually ran at 4.2GHz base and 4.4GHz turbo -- slightly higher frequencies than the newer 6700K chip. Per the leak from coolaler.com, the upcoming 7700K, based on Kaby Lake, will run at a 4.2 GHz base frequency and manage to hit a 4.5GHz maximum turbo speed out of the box. This means that performance, assuming that performance per clock doesn't change, should move up by at least 5%. Additionally, if Intel is able to hit 4.5GHz maximum turbo on a single core out of the box on the top Kaby Lake desktop part, the new chips may also have more headroom than the prior generation in terms of overclocking capability (overclocking is the process by which the user adjusts the chip speed to run at higher levels than what the chip is rated at out of the box). Enabled by Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer process? Earlier this week, Intel talked about the performance enhancements that it's bringing to the table with its second-generation 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, known as 14-nanometer+. According to the company, 14-nanometer+ has 12% better performance than its first-generation 14-nanometer technology. Based on the speed boosts we're seeing here with Kaby Lake, it would appear that the frequency gains are related primarily to the enhanced chip-manufacturing technology. Desktop Kaby Lake looks like a winner Although it would have been nice to see Intel improve the underlying CPU architecture of Kaby Lake to wring even more performance enhancements out of the chip (Intel probably didn't have enough time to do this given that Kaby Lake was added sort of at the proverbial last minute), Kaby Lake looks like a solid successor to the current-generation Skylake chips. I doubt that many owners of the 6600K/6700K chips will rush out and buy systems based on the new Kaby Lake chips, but for owners of older platforms who may have skipped out on Skylake in pursuit of something better, Kaby Lake might just be the ticket.

This week, AT&T said that it is talking with powerful companies about working together on the technology. Computerworld says that Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung and LG are among the possible stablemates. Others, including China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, KDDI, NTT DoCoMo, Telstra and Vodafone, may get in the mix in the future. It is common for big players to band together during a promising new technology’s formative stages, for two main reasons: The short-term goal is to keep progress moving as quickly as possible. In the longer term, such cooperation makes it more likely that the companies’ plans become part of the eventual standard. In what clearly doesn’t constitute a surprise, AT&T competitor Verizon is not one of the companies. Big Growth Ahead for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality IDC has provided some insight into how it thinks the augmented reality/virtual reality (AR and VR) segment will evolve. The company said this week that it expects spending on the category to hit $500 billion next year. Hardware will account for more than half of the forecast revenues during the period. Software services will grow more than 200 percent this year compared to last. During the middle years of the forecast period, however, IDC says software will be overtaken by services revenue. Globally, IDC believes that VR will outshine AR revenues in 2016 and 2017, but that AR revenues will pass VR after 2017. Broadband Grants to Louisville, Raleigh and Austin Louisville, Kentucky; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Austin, Texas each will receive $30,000 grants to help in their efforts to set up high-speed broadband networks. According to The Louisville Courier-Journal, the non-profit Next Century Cities selected the cities to receive the first Charles Benton Next Generation Engagement Awards. The award is funded by the Democracy Fund and the Benton Foundation. Louisville plans to use the funding to provide gigabit service to a community center in West Louisville, though the precise location has not yet been determined. The grant will be used to establish InVision Raleigh, which the story says will promote “visioning” and planning with the local government. Officials in Austin are developing the Smart Work, Learn and Play program. It is aimed at public housing residents. SDN, NFV Leading to Reduced Capex for AT&T This week, Cisco announced significant workforce reductions. The move was caused by the growth of software-defined networks and network functions virtualization (SDN and NFV). SDNs and NFVs will also have a chilling effect on capital expenditures (capex). This week, AT&T Chief Technology Officer and AT&T Labs’ President Andre Fuetsch said at Nomura’s 2016 Media, Telecom and Internet Conference that the new approaches will cut costs for the carrier in the long run. The idea is that over time, the flexibility that SDN and NFV allow and the ability for systems to run on commodity hardware will mean that less expensive equipment will be needed. Fuetsch’s statement, quoted at WirelessWeek, is a sign that the strategy is working: ’As we deploy more and more virtual functions, and as the hardware that we’re running those virtual functions, as that becomes more commoditized, all those efficiencies we gain back,’ Fuetsch explained. ‘We have the option of turning those investments back into the network or keeping those. So I would say, again, it’s hard to speculate here, but definitely a downward trajectory is what we’re looking at.’ Fuetsch didn’t provide percentages on the capex reduction. Big Data, IoT Pushing M&A Market The catchphrase “follow the money” is especially true when it comes to technology merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This week, Ernst & Young said that in the second quarter, there were 28 deals of $1 billion or more in value, the most deals of such sort in history. The previous high was 20 deals, which was set in the fourth quarter of last year. The report points to Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) as the leaders. IoT deals enjoyed 28 percent and 26 percent increases in total number of billion-dollar deals during the year-over-year and to-date calendar year periods, respectively. Big Data rose 13 percent year over year and 29 percent for the year to date. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Dividends have become much more common in the Nasdaq in recent years, but income investors searching for winners there should look beyond yield. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Aug 19, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Getty Images. Historically, the Nasdaq 100 hasn't been well-known as a habitat for dividend stocks. The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success. Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio. The Nasdaq 100's High Yield Winners Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18: Company Dividend Yield Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 8% Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) 5.4% Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) 4.5% Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) 4.4% Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB) 3.7% Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) 3.4% Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) 3.4% Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) 3.2% Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) 3.1% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 3% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016. Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry. Flying lower Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016. Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets. At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices. For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.

The tie-up is the latest between automakers and tech companies hoping to speed driverless cars to market. Here’s a rundown of who’s working with whom: UBER/VOLVO/TOYOTA/OTTO Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo Cars signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. The Volvo SUVs will be part of Uber’s self-driving fleet of taxis in Pittsburgh. Both companies will continue to develop autonomous vehicles separately. Uber also is buying Otto, a startup that has developed software that lets big rigs drive autonomously. Earlier this year, Toyota Motor Corp. bought a small stake in Uber for an undisclosed amount. LYFT/GENERAL MOTORS/CRUISE AUTOMATION General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. earlier this year. The companies are developing a fleet of autonomous electric taxis that could be deployed through Lyft within the next year. GM also acquired Cruise Automation, a startup that makes autonomous vehicle software, for $581 million. LYFT/DIDI CHUXING/UBER/APPLE Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing invested $100 million in Lyft last fall. The partnership allows U.S. customers use the Lyft app to hail Didi rides while in China and vice versa. Uber recently complicated that deal by selling its China business to Didi in exchange for an 18-percent stake in the Chinese company. And there’s another wrinkle: Apple Inc., which is believed to be working on its own autonomous cars, invested $1 billion in Didi in May. GOOGLE/FIAT CHRYSLER Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has been working on self-driving cars since 2009, is working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The vans will let Google double the size of its autonomous test fleet. VOLKSWAGEN/GETT Volkswagen AG invested $300 million in Uber competitor Gett Inc. in May. Gett said it would provide Volkswagen with the technology to expand beyond car ownership and into ride- and car-sharing. BMW/INTEL/MOBILEYE BMW AG, Intel Corp. and Israel’s Mobileye NV are teaming up to build and commercialize driverless cars. The companies say they could have autonomous vehicles in production by 2021. BMW’s iNext electric sedan will serve as the platform for the technology. Intel makes the computer processors necessary to operate self-driving cars, while Mobileye makes advanced camera systems. The vehicles would likely be used by ride-sharing fleets. FORD/VELODYNE/BAIDU Ford Motor Co. is aiming to have fully self-driving cars — with no steering wheels or pedals — in ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. — which has also invested in Uber — are investing $150 million in Velodyne, which makes the laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Ford also acquired Israel-based SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision, and invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps. AUDI/MERCEDES/BMW/HERE Last fall, Nokia Corp. sold its digital mapping business, Here, to a consortium of German automakers for $3 billion. Audi, BMW and Mercedes say precise maps are a key to developing autonomous cars as well as advanced driver assistance features. NISSAN/NASA Under a five-year partnership, researchers from Nissan and NASA are working on autonomous driving systems and human-machine interface projects with software that can be used on both cars and planetary rovers. Nissan hopes to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020.     Tags: autonomous, driving, million, invested, volvo, working, Other stories from today: Self-driving car race sees flurry of partnerships Gap offers muted outlook for annual earnings, lower profit Twitter to let all users filter tweets for higher ‘quality’     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   For what are you most thankful?

The $600 Acer Switch Alpha 12 offers 90% of a Surface Pro, at almost half the cost. While Acer’s brand doesn’t portend quality, their latest 2-in-1 hybrid offers every bit the refinement of a Surface. So should you buy the Acer Switch Alpha 12? If you’re looking for a 2-in-1 convertible tablet and can’t afford a Surface, the Alpha offers a reliable alternative. Those seeking perfection should look elsewhere. If $600 is still a little out of your budget, then no worries: we’re giving ours away to one lucky reader! Enter below for your chance to win. Acer Switch Alpha 12 Giveaway Aesthetics, Design, and Hardware Look and Feel The Acer Switch Alpha 12 looks and feels like a premium tablet, with a somewhat dated brushed aluminum back and rounded corners. In terms of how it feels, Acer went a great deal out of its way to shave down every sharp edge. The streamlined result – while somewhat cumbersome – comes off as pleasant to hold, for brief periods of time. Most users won’t notice the difference between the heft of an Alpha compared to the Surface. In truth, there are few 12-inch tablets out there that you could comfortably hold for any period of time. Ads by Google Of particular note is the Switch Alpha’s kickstand, which allows users to reposition the tablet in several different configurations. Compared to the borderline defective kickstand on the Surface, the Switch Alpha’s design is robust, stiff, and comes with a rubber grip. The grip doubles as a handle, allowing users to hold the tablet in either hand with the keyboard detached. Users can also wield the Alpha with its keyboard folded back, although in this configuration the tablet weighs 2.8kg — which isn’t much less than a 12-inch laptop. While not aesthetically superior to the Surface, in terms of functionality, the Alpha possesses three distinct advantages: First, the kickstand maintains a much stronger, stiffer hinge than the angled flap on the Surface. Second, it’s completely fanless, which means the Alpha runs silently even with its processor running full blast. Third – a backlit keyboard comes included – and it doesn’t feel like a shabby, rattling piece of garbage. The keyboard feels and looks almost as good as the Surface’s, with one shortcoming: its backlighting offers only a single brightness level. A fair compromise, considering the Alpha costs $300 less than the base-model Surface Pro. The price gap increases with higher end models. Hardware Acer ships the Alpha in a dozen different variations. Of these, the three most common versions are the low-end, mid-range, and high-end models. The lowest end of the spectrum comes with a Core i3 (the difference between Core processors Intel Core i3 vs. i5 vs. i7: Which One Do You Really Need?

The mid-tier platform includes a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $800. Finally, the high-end model uses a Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — and it runs for $1,000. I’m unsure as to why Acer doesn’t offer any model with 16GB of RAM. Even though most modern computing tasks don’t require large amounts of RAM, enough users use virtual machines or do heavy-duty video editing, which might lead to sales for their ultra high-end models. Even so, 4GB should be sufficient for the majority of users as the current design of Windows 10, which uses RAM compression How RAM Compression Improves Memory Responsiveness in Windows 10 How RAM Compression Improves Memory Responsiveness in Windows 10 Windows 10 introduced a new feature called RAM compression. This new memory management routine improves system responsiveness. Here we show you how RAM compression works, how to turn it off, and how it impacts performance. Read More , makes 4GB of RAM an adequate amount. The rest of the Alpha’s specifications are standard across all models. Although rumored to offer a 1080p variant, all models include a 2K screen, with a resolution of 2160 x 1440 pixels. It also uses a 2×2 MIMO 802.11ac dual-band (what’s dual band? How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes Using a router that supports the dual-band standard can significantly boost your Wi-Fi speeds in many circumstances. Read More ) wireless adapter. It’s also the heaviest out of all the Surface clones, weighing in at around 2.8 pounds, with the keyboard attached. That’s about 15% heavier than the Surface Pro 4. In truth though, it’s hard to differentiate between a 2.8-pound device and a 2.4-pound one. Ports, Cameras, and Buttons The Switch Alpha includes a generous serving of ports – more than any other 2-in-1 on the planet. The right-side of the tablet houses a 3.5″ audio jack, a USB 3.0 port, a USB 3.1 Type-C port (what’s USB-C? What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More ), a proprietary charging port, and a microSD card slot. It’s worth mentioning that the Alpha can receive a charge from its USB-C port at the same rate of speed as the barrel jack connector. That’s fantastic design. It charges at around 19v/2.37a, which means it can receive 45-watts of power — with the right charger. Unfortunately, many USB-C chargers simply won’t function as advertised. I tested the Alpha’s USB-C charging capabilities using a Lumsing 48-watt USB-C charger. The Lumsing charger manages to output around 20-watts, which indicates power delivery somewhere around 12.5v/2a. On the left-side of the tablet rests three aluminum buttons: A home-screen button, volume rocker, and power button. It also sports two cameras: a front-facing web camera and a rear-facing 5MP camera. Neither camera works with Windows Hello How to Log Into Windows 10 With Finger Scans & Facial Recognition How to Log Into Windows 10 With Finger Scans & Facial Recognition Instead of using a password or PIN, you might be better off using fingerprint scans or facial recognition! But there are a few risks associated with them. Here's what you need to know. Read More , so unlocking the device with your face won’t ever happen. Apparently, Windows Hello requires infrared capabilities, which most of today’s web-cameras lack. Even so, the Surface Pro 4 does offer Windows Hello, and that’s a fairly significant advantage. Screen Quality While writing this review, a question gnawed at me – where did Acer cut corners to hit a $600 entry-level price point? The second cheapest alternative to the Alpha is the HP Spectre x2, which costs $200 more and comes with a Core M processor. And HP cut a lot off its display – the Spectre includes only a 1080p resolution screen. But Acer’s 2-in-1 comes with a 2160 x 1440 screen. One of the places Acer cut corners: battery life. The LCD panel used in the Alpha doesn’t appear to offer the latest standard in power stretching technology – Panel Self Refresh (PSR). PSR allows devices to switch off the device’s graphics processor for as long as the image displayed does not change. PSR on average extends battery life by about an hour. But when a device shows a still image most of the time (such as reading), the battery life can skyrocket by as much as 26%, according to the consortium governing the Embedded DisplayPort standard. Unfortunately, the LCD panel used in the Alpha doesn’t appear to offer PSR technology. This is an unfortunate omission for a 2-in-1 device that might often function as an e-reader. Even so, the tradeoff between quality and price might not deter someone looking to save hundreds over a Surface. Performance Because you more than likely won’t use the Switch Alpha with manufacturer bloatware included, I’m performing benchmarks on a clean configuration. Windows 10 makes the de-bloat process How to Easily Remove Bloatware From Windows 10 How to Easily Remove Bloatware From Windows 10 Windows 10 comes with several pre-installed apps that take up space on your device and aren't easy to remove.

Unlike the majority of Surface clones, the Switch Alpha doesn’t use the slower Core M processor Intel Core M: What's so Great About the Processor? Intel Core M: What's so Great About the Processor? The Intel Core M is the most hyped processor in years, and with good reason: it's at the heart of a new revolution in laptops. Read More , which is a fanless, reduced-power variant of Intel’s “mainstream” mobile Core i processors. The Core M processors typically offer better performance than Intel’s Atom processors, such as those used in regular Surface 3, but with worse performance than even a Core i3-6100U. So, comparing the low-end Switch Alpha to the entry-level Surface 4 Pro, you get better performance for around $400 less. The one area in which it compares poorly to the Surface Pro: battery life. Battery Life The worst, perhaps deal-breaking, feature of the Switch Alpha: poor battery life. Users won’t get more than 5 hours of uptime on a single charge. In truth, no 2-in-1 device with a mainstream Intel processor offers more than 6 hours of standard use. The reason stems from the thinness of the tablet form-factor; the thinner a device, the smaller its battery size. In theory, Acer’s fanless cooling system should help offset its diminutive battery. In practice, it loses at least an hour of uptime compared to its competition. Tinkerers can increase the length of their device’s battery life by optimizing their wireless connection (at the expense of connection reliability), optimizing their graphics processor for maximum battery life, de-bloating their system of apps, and entering battery life mode. With these modifications, battery life increases substantially, but I found that the length of up-time relates more closely to the kind of activities being performed, rather than the implementation of any specific or combination of user-configurable battery life optimizations. In short, here’s what I found out: Battery life for standard use: ~5 hours. Reading: ~8-10 hours. Gaming: 3-4 hours. By any standard, these are mediocre at best battery life numbers. While you could easily find budget laptops with worse battery lives, in the $600 price range, some devices can outlast the Alpha by a factor of two or even three. Of course, none of those devices would be 2-in-1 hybrids with mainstream Intel processors. Windows Ink In the Windows Anniversary Update (AU), Microsoft added a unique feature for Windows convertible 2-in-1 tablets: Windows Ink. It’s little more than a note-taking application, but it makes drawing notes using a stylus much easier. Users only need to click on the Ink icon in the taskbar to begin sketching. However, Acer did not include a stylus with its Alpha starter package, and so I was unable to test this feature. The pressure-sensitive stylus offers 256 degrees of pressure, which makes it on par with the Surface Pro 3. Liquid Cooling Traditionally, laptops use mobile processors that require a fan. Fans come with four problems: First, they can suck up a fair amount of wattage, thus they incur additional drain on the battery. Second, fans can produce a lot of noise. Third, fans take up a lot of space, which results in a thicker tablet. Lastly, fans break down over time through a combination of wear and tear, and dust accumulation. Acer’s LiquidLoop cooling system dispenses with a fan. It uses a heat pipe design, which transmits thermal waste energy from the processor into the aluminum shell of the tablet. The loop style design helps distribute heat throughout the entirety of the metal shell, which aids thermal dissipation. After stress testing (using Prime95) the Acer for an hour, the temperature rose as high as 75 degrees Celsius, which approaches the thermal shutdown limit of the processor (which is probably somewhere between 80 and 90 degrees Celsius). I don’t have a thermal temperature reader, but I estimate the metal body of the Acer to reach somewhere around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Not exactly burn-inducing, but definitely on the threshold of discomfort. Fanless cooling systems rely extensively on the ambient temperature. The hotter the weather, the less efficient the cooling system. Therefore, someone living along the equator might prefer an active cooling system. Fortunately, no one in their right mind runs software similar to Prime95 for an hour on a 2-in-1 device. Overall, I would judge Acer’s cooling system as excellent. Hopefully, other manufacturers adopt it. Otherwise, we’re stuck with the lackluster Core M processor in the short term. Warranty and Reliability Acer bumped up the Alpha’s warranty to a whopping two years! That’s double the warranty offered by the Surface Pro 4 and beats all competitors within the 2-in-1 hybrid tablet market — which is amazing on a $600 device. Acer might feel confident about the long-term durability because of its fanless cooling system and lack of moving parts. It’s not a standard warranty, either. It’s a “traveler’s warranty” which covers multiple regions and includes both ship-in and ship-out costs. I’m still waiting on an iFixit teardown (this review will receive an update once that becomes available). From what I can tell, the Switch Alpha employs standard Philips screws, which anchor its rear panel in place. Should You Buy the Acer Switch Alpha 12? What’s Great? By far the least expensive Surface Pro 4 clone around High-quality construction Fanless Mainstream Intel Processor Charges over both USB-C and its barrel connector 2 years of international warranty with covered shipping costs! What’s Not So Good? Not compatible with Windows Hello Loaded with bloatware What’s Terrible? 3-4 Hours of battery life for gaming The price difference is so enormous; I can’t see myself recommending the Surface over a Switch Alpha. The 2 years of warranty really put the Switch Alpha over the top. Those looking for a cheaper version of the Surface should check out the Switch Alpha. It performs on the same level, offers superior build quality, but loses about an hour (or more) of battery life in comparison. For those looking for a perfect 2-in-1, you’re better off with a Surface.

I bought the Acer Switch Alpha 12 (i5-6200U, 8GB, 256GB SSD) at Costco last week for $699, which includes the stylus, keyboard, 90-day money back return privilege, Concierge technical support, and 2nd-year free warranty. I am a longtime 'Tablet PC' user. In fact, the Switch will replace my beloved Lenovo X200T. So far I am very impressed with this little machine, although I am still learning some of the quirks. It's smaller and lighter than most of the folders I carry back forth between work & home. Battery life has been fine for me - lasts all day long at work doing typical office tasks including PDF editing. I also watch a few YouTube Excel tutorials during the day. The Switch feels as solid as my iPad 2 and I am pleased with its build quality so far. My stylus' buttons tended to stick at first but loosened with use; they're fine now. The stylus is fine for my tasks; I'm not an artist trying to do serious graphics work on a low-cost portable. The stylus uses one (1) AAAA (four A) battery, and it appears to turn itself odd after a period of nonuse. Clicking one of its buttons wakes it up instantly. The screen is gorgeous. The stand is very sturdy, as reported, and the keyboard can flip alt the way around and tuck under the display (if you don't want to detach it). The keyboard has a raised perimeter to protect the keys when the keyboard is tucked under, and the keys are disabled in that mode. Attached to the left side of the keyboard is a simple loop to store the stylus. I would have preferred something on the tablet itself for when the keyboard is left behind. I am not a fan of Apple-style click trackpads but this one seems to work OK. I am still learning the different touch gestures and such (screen as well as the trackpad). Mine did not have much 'bloatware' preinstalled although there were a couple of shortcuts to install some extras if desired. The included Acer utilities are minimalist. Or maybe I was just spoiled by Lenovo's ThnkVantage suite. I have not yet updated to the Windows 10 Anniversary edition but plan to do so soon. Reply Kannon Y September 10, 2016 at 3:19 pm That's also my impression of the Switch Alpha: Great tablet, low price. I hope more people buy this thing because it's definitely worth the money. Reply Kannon Yamada November 15, 2016 at 3:24 am Hi SamCal, I contacted Acer regarding some of the points that you've brought up. The Switch is fully Windows 10 AU compliant, so it updated without a hitch. So far I'm getting improved battery life. Also, they confirmed that the warranty includes 2-years (SHIPPING COSTS PAID BY ACER!). The warranty is what put it over the top for me. I went out and bought one for myself and bumped the score up to 10/10, based mainly on the degree of value it offers. It's a really stellar 2-in-1.

Sir, I found a link pointing to wrong article, kindly correct it. "difference between Core processors" links to article entitled "How RAM Compression Improves Memory". Reply Kannon Yamada August 24, 2016 at 6:32 pm Hello Summet, thanks for the comment and correction! It should be fixed now. The max temp is in the article. The Alpha hits 75 C after an hour of stress testing. The skin temperature is somewhere around 38 C, which means it's pretty hot, but not skin-burning hot.

Previous models in the Switch range have been modest performers that relied on Intel's Core M processors, but the Alpha 12 steps up to true laptop levels of performance with the latest Skylake processors and provides a cost-effective alternative to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. UK prices for the Switch Alpha 12 start at just £549.99 (inc. VAT, or £458.32 ex. VAT) for the entry-level model reviewed here, which is based on a Core i3-6100U processor running at 2.3GHz. This model includes 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, along with a detachable keyboard and a stylus. In contrast, Microsoft's Surface Pro starts at £749 (inc. VAT, or £624.17 ex. VAT) with just a Core M processor, and no keyboard (which costs about £100 extra) so Acer certainly wins on sheer value for money. There's also an i5 model with 8GB of RAM for £749.99 inc. VAT (or £625 ex. VAT), while the top-of-the-range i7 configuration includes 8GB memory and a 256GB SSD for a still-competitive £899.99 (inc. VAT or £750 ex. VAT). Those prices include Windows 10 Home, but Windows 10 Pro is also available for business users for an additional £50 (inc. VAT, or £41.67 ex. VAT). Acer's 12-inch Switch Alpha 12 runs on Core i3/5/7 processors and starts at £549.99 (inc. VAT), including stylus and keyboard. Image: Acer Taking the stand The design of the Switch Alpha 12 is conventional enough, but still highly practical. On its own, the 12-inch tablet measures 10mm thick and weighs 0.9kg, which is a little heavy for a tablet of this size, and you'll probably need to hold it with both hands when it's not resting on your lap or on a desk. However, the aluminium case does feel very sturdy, and more than capable of surviving the occasional bump when you're travelling. We also like the fold-out stand on the back of the tablet, which can easily be adjusted to improve visibility. Connections include USB 3.0 and USB-C ports. Image: Acer There's a 2MP webcam on the front of the tablet, along with a 5MP rear-facing camera. Tucked onto the right-hand edge of the tablet you'll find both USB 3 and USB-C ports, along with a MicroSD card slot. However, we'd question the wisdom of putting the power socket and headphone socket so close together on that side of the device. We almost plugged the power supply into the headphone socket on more than one occasion -- which is something you'll probably want to avoid. The snap-on keyboard is a comfortable platform for fast typing, although we were less impressed with the trackpad. Image: Acer The keyboard works well, and is a welcome addition at this price. It snaps easily into place using magnetic contacts, and the keyboard panel is angled slightly upwards so that it feels more comfortable than simply lying flat on your desk. There's a decent amount of travel on the keys too, and it certainly feels more suited to fast typing than many of the flat-panel keyboards we've seen recently. The keyboard brings the total weight of the device to 1.25kg, but that's still lighter than many conventional laptops. In fact, our only complaint here is that the trackpad doesn't work quite so well. The pressure needed to click the trackpad seems to vary across the surface of the trackpad, and it sometimes rattles quite audibly when you tap to select items. That's a minor complaint though, and the keyboard will certainly allow you to use the Switch Alpha 12 as a serious working laptop when you need to. Picture & performance Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 The display of the Switch Alpha 12 is another strong point. The 12-inch IPS panel has a resolution of 2,160 by 1,440 pixels, which at 216ppi is lower than the 2,736 by 1,824 and 267ppi of the 12.3-inch Surface Pro, but still more than adequate for high-definition video. The image quality is extremely good too -- bright and colourful, with close to full 180-degree viewing angles all around, so it'll work well for impromptu presentations when you're on the road. The stereo speakers sound a little tinny, but they're loud enough for watching streaming video or giving a presentation in a coffee shop. The Switch 12 Alpha will also be fast enough to handle presentations and other Microsoft Office apps, even with the entry-level Core i3/4GB configuration. Our review unit achieved a multiprocessor score of 5540 when running the Geekbench 3 test suite, compared to 4863 for the entry-level Core M version of the Surface Pro, or 5474 for Apple's even more expensive 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Graphics performance was a pleasant surprise too, with the integrated HD 520 graphics managing a quite respectable 39fps when running the Cinebench R15 OpenGL graphics benchmark. That's only a sliver behind the 40.3fps of the more expensive i5 version of the Surface Pro 4. We were also pleased to see -- or rather hear -- that the Switch Alpha 12 runs silently, thanks to Acer's fanless LiquidLoop cooling system. And, of course, if you need even more power then the i5 and i7 models are available at equally competitive prices. The only real disappointment is battery life. The sheer brightness of the display allowed us to turn the brightness down to 50 percent while streaming video from the BBC iPlayer, but even then the 37Wh battery in the Switch Alpha 12 only managed to last for a modest 4 hours 20 minutes. Less intensive use might allow you to stretch that closer to five hours, but that's still below par for a modern tablet or laptop. Conclusions There's room for improvement when it comes to battery life, and business travellers who spend a lot of time on trains and planes might want to pay a little extra for a longer-lasting device. Even so, Acer's Switch Alpha 12 is still very good value for money, and delivering decent performance and a high-quality display for a device costing just £550 (inc. VAT). And, with the keyboard and stylus included as standard features, the Switch Alpha 12 has a real edge over most of its convertible rivals.

Credit: Intel/IDGNS More like this Intel's Atom chips for cars and IoT could shed ugly mobile past Intel is on the verge of exiting the smartphone and tablet markets Intel's Joule board to support Windows 10 IoT Core Video Preview: Computerworld's smart cities video tour, coming soon! In 2009, Apple CEO Tim Cook memorably trashed Atom-based netbooks for being "junky" hardware that underperformed. Intel's Atom chips have come a long way since, with the latest generation code-named Broxton boasting the most impressive improvements. The new Atom T5500 and 5700 chips have features found in low-end PC processors, but the chips are instead targeted at robots, drones, wearables, and smart home devices. A standout feature is 4K decoding and encoding capabilities, which could allow the chips to be used in virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. Intel showed smart glasses, a bartending robot, and a smart motorcycle helmet with the Broxton chips at the Intel Developer Forum this week. Intel also said the chips could be used be in storage or media servers. Earlier this year, Intel abruptly discontinued Atom chips for smartphones. At the time, Intel said it would stop developing Broxton chips, but the company appears to have changed its mind. The target markets for Broxton chips aligns with the company's focus on the growing markets of virtual reality and the internet of things. Intel is trying to position Atom chips for devices outside of PCs, which have seen shipments fall. But over the last few months, Intel has softened its stance on how it could use Atom chips. Broxton could be used in specialized enterprise tablets, and there's a remote possibility that device makers will use the new Atom chips in low-end or thumb stick-sized PCs. The new Atom chips will support Windows 10 desktop, Windows 10 IoT Core, Linux, Android, and the VxWorks real-time OS. You can get the new Atom chip through Intel's latest Joule developer board, which like Raspberry Pi 3, is targeted at people looking to build devices. The $369 Joule 570x has a 1.7GHz Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 16GB of storage, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The Joule could be an expensive, albeit excellent, media server with support for 4K and the latest Wi-Fi technology. The T5500 and T5700 chips are based on Intel's latest Goldmont architecture, which will also be in upcoming Celeron and Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake. The chips draw only six to 12 watts of power. The 4K video capabilities come thanks to an improved Gen9 integrated graphics processor, which is also in Intel's current batch of chips based on the Skylake architecture. The chips can support up to three 4K DisplayPort and HDMI displays at a 60Hz refresh rate. Visual computing is becoming important, especially with robots, drones, and self-driving cars relying on cameras for motion tracking and gesture and image recognition. The Atom chips have a next-generation image processing engine that speeds up visual computing. There is also a 50 percent to 80 percent improvement in memory bandwidth compared to the previous Atom chip, based on the Silvermont architecture released in 2015, according to Intel. There is also support for error correction, which was previously available only on Atom server chips.

Available in three different models (TVS-1282T, TVS-882T and TVS-682T) the TVS-x82T series is powered by 6th Generation Intel® 14nm multi-core processors that deliver higher system performance for CPU-demanding applications. Featuring an advanced hardware design based on the concept of tiered storage, application-based partitioning, and network traffic distribution the TVS-x82T series achieves maximized storage efficiency and optimum performance. The TVS-x82T also features a HDMI 2.0 port for a prime viewing experience with smooth 4K 60 fps video transfer and display, while the new VJBOD function allows for maximized storage utilization by using multiple QNAP NAS to expand the storage capacity of the TVS-x82T. "With upgraded hardware and software features, the TVS-x82T series is a huge step above the previous QNAP Thunderbolt 2 NAS and the three different models provide greater choice for a wider range of users," said David Tsao, Product Manager of QNAP. "The TVS-x82T provides tiered storage, application-based partitioning, and network traffic distribution to optimize the efficiency of different NAS applications and provides businesses with an ideal storage solution for intensive virtualization, video surveillance storage, high-resolution video editing, and much more." The TVS-x82T features advanced hardware for greater efficiency, including built-in SATA M.2 SSD, 2.5" SSD slots, compartmentalized smart cooling, and tool-less HDD installation. QNAP's Qtier technology empowers the TVS-x82T with auto tiering that helps continuously optimize storage efficiency across M.2 SSD, SSD and SATA drives, and these different storage media can be configured as independent partitions for different applications to ensure a sufficient throughput level for every application. With multiple network ports, it allows applications to use dedicated interfaces to meet network traffic distribution requirements. The TVS-x82T comes with three HDMI outputs, including one HDMI 2.0. Users can connect the NAS to a HDTV or A/V receiver and use the powerful HD Player media player in HD Station with the QNAP remote control to enjoy rich media content and 4K 60 fps videos. They can also use three monitors in either "duplicated" or "extended" desktop configuration for improved multitasking convenience and productivity. The TVS-x82T's storage capacity can be scaled up by connecting up to six QNAP Thunderbolt 2 expansion enclosures (TX-800P and TX-500P). The storage capacity can also be enlarged by using the new VJBOD feature that allows the storage capacity of other QNAP NAS to be used as virtual disks that can be mounted as local disks for shares, applications, or even creating another LUN. "VJBOD introduces an economical way to utilize unused NAS storage, and offers an additional storage expansion solution that maximizes storage utilization," said Ripple Wu, Product Manager of QNAP. The TVS-x82T Thunderbolt 2 NAS not only features Thunderbolt 2 (20 Gbps) technology but also has dual 10GbE ports for flexible connectivity and incredible performance. It is a perfect match for Thunderbolt-equipped Mac® & Windows® users in 4K workflows, file storage, and backup. The TVS-x82T series is ideal for organizations to build a secure private cloud, and its intuitive and powerful QTS operating system facilitates file storage, backup, sharing and synchronization tasks. The TVS-x82T supports the centralized remote management solution QRM+ (QNAP Remote Manager Plus) to enable IT staff to discover, map, monitor, and manage critical computing devices (Servers/PCs/Thin Clients) on the network, and allows remote KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) for IPMI devices and KVM recording and playback for tracking actions. Virtualization Station allows users to host Windows, Linux, UNIX® and Android' based virtual machines. Container Station integrates LXC and Docker® lightweight virtualization technologies to fulfill unlimited containerized applications. With QvPC technology, users can easily operate the NAS as a PC by plugging in a keyboard, mouse and HDMI display to access stored data, run multiple virtual machines, surf the web, enjoy high-resolution videos with HD Player, monitor live feeds on Surveillance Station, and much more.

Awake: 10 must-read articles for August 19 Twitter rolls out new anti-abuse tools, scientists have rewritten the E.coli genome By WIRED 19 Aug 2016 By WIRED Friday 19 August 2016 Shutterstock Your WIRED daily briefing. Today, Twitter has started rolling out new anti-abuse features to all users, scientists have rewritten the E.coli genome, AMD's forthcoming Zen processor promises performance to rival Intel's Broadwell-E range and more.

Twitter finally extends anti-abuse filters to all users Twitter has announced that all of its users will now be able to use its quality filter, previously only available to verified users, to block abusive tweets from appearing in their feed (Motherboard). Due to roll out to everyone "in the coming days", the filter screens out posts from spam and retweet bots as well as posts from accounts you don't follow or interact with that use abusive language. All users will also now be able to set their accounts to receive notifications from only people they follow.

Scientists rewrite E.coli genome Synthetic biologists at Harvard University in the USA, led by geneticist George Church, have designed a synthetic version of the stomach bacterium Escherichia coli genome, a feat involving 62,000 changes to the microbe's DNA (Science). The team altered seven of E.coli's 64 codons – genetic sequences that encode amino acids – proving that major changes can be made without being lethal to the cells. Radically altering DNA in this manner could potentially render cells immune to certain viruses. As a failsafe, Church and his team plan to make their modified microbes dependent on a synthetic nutrient to prevent them from surviving in the wild. 3. AMD Zen processor promises to challenge Intel Broadwell-E AMD has announced new details about its forthcoming Zen processors, while also officially delaying their release until "early 2017" (Ars Technica). A demonstration showed the eight-core, 16-thread Zen 'Summit Ridge' chip outperforming a similarly specified Intel Broadwell-E CPU, thought to be the Core i7-6900K, in a Blender rendering demo. AMD also demonstrated a dual-CPU configuration involving the enterprise-grade Zen 'Naples' CPU. The Zen chips are manufactured on a 14nm FinFET process, with simultaneous rather than clustered multithreading and the promise of a new caching system that's set to improve on the sometimes lacklustre performance of AMD's Bulldozer processors relative to their Intel rivals. 4. Uber's driverless taxis will be on the streets this month Uber users will be able to hail self-driving cars in a matter of weeks (WIRED). The futuristic service will launch in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the end of this month according to reports, but there is no news yet about when or whether it will come to the UK. Uber will let users in Pittsburgh summon self-driving cars made by Volvo from their phones, with the two companies becoming the first to put customers in self-driving cars – albeit with an emergency human driver. Rides will be free in the short-term, rather than the usual rate of $1.30 per mile, with the company predicting prices will drop so low it will be cheaper to take an Uber for long trips than own a car. The cars are fitted with dozens of sensors using cameras, lasers, GPS receivers and radar to navigate roads and other traffic.

Zebra finch songs prepare unhatched young for warm climates A new study has found that Zebra finches use special calls to regulate the development of embryos in their unhatched eggs, and that eggs exposed to specific calls hatch into finches that are better equipped to deal with hot climates (Science). Mylene Mariette and Katherine Buchanan of Australia's Deakin University found that parents only used the special calls during the last five days of the incubation period if the maximum daily temperature rose above 26°C. Young from eggs that were exposed to the hot-weather calls were smaller and better able to lose heat in hot climates, and went on to produce more fledgelings in their own first breeding season than the control birds, which didn't hear the song and were larger and more capable of thriving in cooler temperatures. The calls provide a natural coping mechanism against a warming climate and scientists now suspect that egg-calling behaviour could be a widespread used by birds to prepare their young for the environment they will hatch into. 6. Helsinki is getting tiny driverless buses This week, the Finnish capital Helsinki is getting a pair of compact driverless buses as part of the SOHJOA last-mile transport automation project (Ars Technica). The trial will operate until mid-September in the city's Hernesaari area, and can each carry up to nine passengers. Finnish law doesn't require vehicles to have a driver, but there's still a human onboard to take over control in case of emergencies. The French-made EasyMile EZ10 self-driving buses have a top speed of 40kph, although they'll be travelling at just 11kph during the trial. 7. Facebook partners with Unity to build a PC gaming platform Games on Facebook could start getting a lot more impressive, as development engine Unity has announced a new partnership with the social network (WIRED). Unity is renowned for its versatility, allowing developers to create anything from simple 2D mobile games to fully-featured virtual reality and augmented reality titles for PC and consoles. The new deal adds the site to that mix. "Unity will integrate support for the Facebook platform, including an all-new PC gaming platform currently in development," Jack King Choi, Facebook's Product Marketing Manager, wrote in a blog post on Facebook's developers section. The move will give developers "new ways to reach and engage Facebook's audience of 650M+ gamers." Interested developers can apply here for immediate access to a closed alpha build of Unity 5.4, which will introduce the 'export to Facebook' tool.

No Man's Sky gets its first patch Hello Games has released the first post-launch patch for No Man's Sky on the PC and PS4, addressing a number of the technical issues early players of the space exploration sim have complained of (Eurogamer). While full patch notes aren't yet available, Hello Games founder Sean Murray said on Twitter that "PC build adds support for more hardware + improves frame rate at low spec. PS4 improves stability + lots more". 9. Watch the latest Overwatch animated short Blizzard has released another animated short to promote and provide extra background narrative to its hit team shooter, Overwatch (RockPaperShotgun). This time, the focus of the beautifully animated 3D film is robotic killing machine Bastion, exposing a more emotional side to the mechanised menace. Like a number of the Overwatch shorts, The Last Bastion is touching to the point of being a little manipulative, but well worth a watch for its Pixar and Ghibli-inspired artistry. 10. The Lost Boys are coming to the small screen US TV network The CW has licenced cult Joel Schumacher's cult 1987 teen vampire flick The Lost Boys for a seven-season series under the oversight of Veronica Mars and iZombie writer Rob Thomas (Deadline). Set to be produced by Gulfstream TV and Warner Bros Television, each season will cover a decade of time, starting in 1967 San Francisco. The settings and human cast members will change from season to season, with only the immortal vampires remaining constant. ADVERTISEMENT Popular on WIRED See inside Syria's brutal Saydnaya prison with this digital reconstruction Cases of death and disappearance are regular occurrences for those in Syria's notorious Saydnaya prison. Those who have lived through the country's 'justice' regime have reported beatings and brutality at the hands of guards – with little public documentation. Now, former prisoners have helped to create one of the first glimpses inside the prison by working with architects to produce computer models based on their memories, including the sounds they heard. Forensic Architecture, a project from Goldsmith's University, London, and Amnesty International have worked together on the recreations of both the inside and outside of the facility.

Dota 2 Vulkan vs. OpenGL Numbers For Intel Skylake On Linux 4.8 + Mesa 12.1-dev Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 18 August 2016 at 08:33 PM EDT. 19 Comments Last month when I was trying Intel's open-source Vulkan driver with Dota 2 and The Talos Principle the Linux gaming experience didn't go well, it didn't even really work even when experimenting with Mesa Git and toggling items like the Steam Overlay. With my fresh Git testing today, it went a bit better. Dota 2 now ran fine with the Mesa 12.1-dev Git stack for me on the Core i5 6600K system! Last month on Mesa 12.1-dev Git on Ubuntu 16.04, I had no such luck even when disabling the Steam Overlay, but during my tests today on a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS + Mesa 12.1-dev Git + Linux 4.8 Git, all the pieces came together... Thus there are some Dota 2 OpenGL vs. Vulkan benchmarks on the Intel Mesa driver below. But no results to share today for The Talos Principle. The Talos Principle menus were no longer rendering far of course as they had been up until at least one month ago, but the in-game benchmark mode was really choppy even with the "lowest" settings. When increasing the settings and restarting the game, the visuals still looked different from their renderings with OpenGL, so this game was omitted from testing today. Below are Dota 2 OpenGL vs. Vulkan benchmarks for the test system described above with Linux 4.8 Git and the newest Mesa code from this HD Graphics 530 Skylake system: At least for this i5-6600K system, the Intel OpenGL driver remained faster at all tested resolutions over the current Vulkan Linux driver. Then again, Dota 2 still wasn't too playable even with the OpenGL driver on the current HD Graphics hardware unless you plan on running at a very low resolution -- with Iris Graphics it's probably a different story. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is rumored to contain improvements in hardware and design. The second-generation laptop might sport a redesigned hinge, use Intel's latest Kaby Lake chip and offer a video resolution that can go up as high as 4K. The latest rumors suggest that the Surface Book 2 will have a new design for its hinge. Many owners are getting frustrated with the Dynamic-Fulcrum hinge, which is installed on the first-generation model. Users are annoyed by the gap it leaves when the notebook is closed, it makes their Chiclet-type keyboard and display screen accumulate dirt. It also requires an additional step in order to detach the screen from the keyboard base -- a shortcut either on the screen, or by pressing down a dedicated button on the keyboard. However, no information is currently available on what Microsoft will implement this time on the second generation of its device, but it is expected to look like traditional laptop design where no gap is visible. Concerning the specifications, the upcoming 2-in-1 is rumored to be sporting the seventh-generation Intel processor known as Kaby Lake. There is only a slight difference when it comes to performance from the current Skylake, but the newer one will be natively supporting USB 3.1 and has 3D capabilities. Some sources say that the upcoming device will be able to support up to 4K resolution, which is a big step from the 3000 x 2000 pixels the current one has. Previous reports also mentioned that the Surface Book 2 will be using the Redstone 2 version of Windows 10, which will be the third major update for the operating system and contains several structural improvements to the Windows OneCore and a new notification system within File Explorer. Meanwhile, Microsoft is also expected to launch an all-in-one Surface series, which will go against the other manufacturer's similar offerings. It is rumored to be available in three different screen sizes, 21 inches, which offers a Full HD 1080p resolution and 24 inches and 27 inches offering 4K resolution, Express reported. Microsoft has not offered any official statement concerning the Surface Book 2. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it What does it mean to reach emotional maturity as a Christian?

The sale is for a limited time only and ends on Saturday, Aug. 20.  ( Microsoft ) Advertisement Best Buy is offering the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and a Type Cover at a discount of $280. The online retailer has started a 50-hour sale that lasts from Thursday, Aug. 18 at 10 p.m. CT to Saturday, Aug, 20 at 11:59 p.m CT. The latest sale is offering a number of products, including the Surface Pro 4, at discounted prices. "When you buy this Surface Pro 4 along with a Type Cover below, you can save $280 total. The Type Cover features well-spaced, backlit keys so you can type comfortably. It doubles as a protective shield for the screen. Choose from five colors. Plus, get free shipping," says Best Buy. The retailer is offering the base model of the Surface Pro 4 that has 128 GB on-board storage and 4 GB of RAM, and is running on Intel Core m3 processor. As part of the bundle, customers have to pick a Type Cover that comes in five different colors: teal, black, blue, bright blue and red. The original price of the tablet is $899.99 and the Type Cover, $129.99. When combined they have a total value of $1029.98. Luckily as part of the 50-hour sale, customers will get $280 off, bringing down the cost of the bundle to $749.98. The discount will appear only once the two products are added to the cart. Best Buy notes that the offer is not available in-store and cannot be combined with the College Student Deals, which offer up to $150 off on select Surface Pro tablets. The deal should be very attractive to customers looking to buy a new Microsoft tablet as the base model of the Surface Pro 4 is available from the company's own website for $749, excluding the Type Cover. Microsoft launched and released the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015 as the fourth-gen two-in-one detachable tablet in the company's Surface Pro line. Best Buy's discount could be taken as an indication that Microsoft is planning to unveil the next-gen Surface Pro 5 soon and wants to get rid of its Surface Pro 4 stock. However, previous rumors suggest that the Surface Pro 5's launch has been delayed because Intel will launch the Kaby Lake processor — expected to power the next Surface Pro tablets — toward the end of this year. Since Microsoft released the first-gen Surface Pro tablet in February 2013, the company may opt for a February release for the Surface Pro 5 as well. The Surface Pro 4 remains one of the most powerful detachable tablets currently available in the market, so the latest deal from Best Buy is worth a shot for those who want to purchase a new tablet.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links Search No Man’s Sky’s PC patch is out now By Joe Donnelly Frame rates stabilised, but texture pop-in and draw distance still an issue. Shares It’s still without patch notes, but the PC version of No Man’s Sky’s 1.04 patch is now live. The patch—which went into testing earlier this week—aims to address the game’s launch issues which included poor performance, stuttering, FPS drops and screen-tearing for some players.   Taking to Twitter, Hello Games’ top man Sean Murray said: Patch notes incoming but PC build adds support for more hardware + improves frame rate at low spec. PS4 improves stability + lots more :)August 18, 2016 In his No Man’s Sky review, Chris made mention of the latest PC patch’s effect. On his system (Intel i5-6600K @ 3.50 GHz, 8 GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 980), he appeared to enjoy a solid performance that typically boasted up to 75 FPS, however did note that he experienced the odd drop to 20-30 prior to the patch. It appears to have sorted that out, but that’s not to say all has been sorted.  “I played NMS for a couple days on PlayStation 4 before the PC release, and I thought for sure the late texture pop-in wouldn’t be so bad on PC,” remarks Chris in his review. “But it’s constant, on every planet I fly over and land on. Not only when rocketing at top speed over hills and caves but also when drifting slowly and landing, and even when walking and sometimes just standing still and turning around—the slow materialization of landscape features is ever-present.  “Flying from the surface of one planet and landing on another with no loading screens may technically be seamless, but watching half a mountain slowly form itself in front of my visor doesn’t make it feel that way.” Murray maintains the vast majority of players are now playing No Man’s Sky without issue. “It's pretty crazy for us how many people are playing,” he adds via Twitter. “And how large a number even 1% of that user base is. We're totally focused on customer support right now. Then we'll move onto improving and adding features to the game.” Topics News Hello Games Adventure No Man's Sky We recommendBy Zergnet Load Comments Recommended The best Black Friday PC gaming deals for 2016 The PC Gamer holiday gift guide Hardware Buying Guides Latest Game Reviews 1 The best controller for PC gaming 2 The best RGB LED Lighting Kit 3 The best wireless gaming mouse 4 The best ATX mid-tower PC cases 5 Recommended PC gaming chairs 1 Hitman: The Complete First Season review 2 Killing Floor 2 review 3 Planet Coaster review 4 Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse review 5 Dishonored 2 review PC Gamer Newsletter Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.

These brands may not be known to the general public, but they are the Rolls Royces, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis of the audio world. Rhapsody opened its doors in 2004. Before he started working in audio Visintainer was at Intergraph Corporation in Alabama and later Intel doing sales and marketing, but his fascination with high-end audio dates back decades. Rhapsody's partner in sound and style, the Iliad showroom in NYC.Photo by Rhapsody/Iliad We chatted for a while, but Visintainer was eager to walk a few blocks to check out the Iliad showroom. That space was filled with gorgeous bespoke furniture and art, great stuff indeed, but I didn't at first notice the Goldmund speakers deployed throughout the lavish surroundings! You see, Visintainer also sells "lifestyle" ultra high-end audio systems, working hand in hand with Iliad's designers. The Swiss-made Goldmund speakers can be custom-finished to the buyer's requirements. In-wall Goldmund speakers are also available, anything is possible. I assumed Rhapsody was exclusively a two-channel audiophile oriented enterprise, so I was a little surprised to learn three-quarters of the systems Visintainer sells have video or home theater components. He has customers all over the world, but if they are in the NYC area, Visintainer visits their homes to get a fix on their rooms acoustics. He's a big guy, and has learned over the years how to uncrate 300-pound speakers and 200-pound amplifiers by himself! After spending time at Iliad we returned to the Rhapsody showroom, where I took in the staggering array of audio components. We listened to a pair of Magico S1 Mk II speakers, which sounded great, but then we talked about how customers find Rhapsody: word of mouth, referrals from manufacturers or in the press. Audiophiles seek out the store because it sells components no other NYC area dealers do. For some lines Rhapsody might be the only US dealer. Many customers are wealthy and extremely busy, so they rarely have time to come to the showroom or get involved with selecting their systems. That's also true for the most famous ones, they have aides and assistants that handle that stuff. Visintainer wasn't about to divulge any rock, sports or movie star customers names, he was too discreet for that. I tried to pry a few loose, but he remained mum. Some of those customers even have Iliad design furniture to house the gear. To say I was impressed with the store and Visintainer's expertise and passion for audio would be an understatement. I've visited a lot of audio shops in my time, but nothing compares with Rhapsody Music & Cinema.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A ADATA XPG Z1 Series DDR4 DRAM Dual Channel Module The XPG Z1 DRAM Module is the first DDR4 overclocking memory of XPG Series, which supports the latest Intel® Haswell-E platform for ultimate performance. It's designed for overclockers, gamers, and PC enthusiasts thanks to its remarkable performance and power efficiency. With the benefits of DDR4, the XPG Z1 is not only a powerful weapon for gaming, also an important component for overclocking! Amazing Performance with Great Power Efficiency DDR4 outperforms DDR3 with improved performance and lower power consumption. The operating voltage has decreased from 1.5V to 1.2V, which is a 20% reduction of power, and keeps the system at a low temperature for stable operation. It only requires 1.2V to achieve high clock frequency of 2800MHz for overclockers. Additionally, the SPD (Serial Presence Detect) of XPG Z1 allows direct application without changing settings in the BIOS, facilitating usage and system stability. Looks Cool, Acts Cool The jet wing-inspired design of XPG Z1 combines the carbon texture used for race cars, symbolizing the pursuit of extreme performance. It also features excellent cooling and stable data transfer due to Thermal Conductive Technology and 10-layer PCBs with 2oz of copper to effectively reduce electric resistance and consume less power, which greatly enhances the quality of signal transfer. Top-Quality Chips For High Durability XPG Z1 DDR4 DRAM Module is made of high-quality chips selected through a strict filtering process. It also uses the top quality PCBs (Printed Circuit Board) that effectively extend the lifespan of memory modules.

Search for: Welcome Philosophy Services What Sets Us Apart Client Letters Blog Contact Us Leading Tech Companies All Chasing The Same “Next Big Things” August 16, 2016 10:23 AM | Leave a Comment | Chad Brand I miss the old days of tech investing. Times were simpler. Companies were more focused. There were one or two companies that tended to be dominant within a certain fragment of the industry. Google was search and online advertising. Amazon was e-commerce. Intel was chips. eBay was marketplace. Microsoft was operating systems and productivity software. Cisco was networking. Apple was high-end devices. Facebook was social networking. Netflix was movies. You get the picture. Oh how times have changed. The tech landscape now has led us down a different path. Each of these companies has been extremely successful in conquering their home turf. They are all wildly profitable and have more money than they know what to do with. So they repurchase shares and pay dividends and buy startups to add talent and new technology. And after they do all of that they still have billions of dollars extra sitting around. What to do? It appears the answer now is to become a tech conglomerate. Heck, if we took over one area of the marketplace, why not shoot for the stars? Why not be everything to everybody? So now when we talk about the leading tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) the future looks far less predictable. In the old world Tesla would be the de facto electric self-driving car play. But Google is building cars. So is Apple. In the old world Oculus would have been the virtual/augmented reality play. But in the new world Facebook acquires them and then Microsoft and Apple and Google all start working on the same thing. In the old world Netflix would be the benchmark for streaming video. Nobody would argue that households looking to get rid of their $100/month cable bills would substitute them with a half dozen individual services that cost $10-$20 per month. The expensive cable bundle is no worse than a bundle of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube Red, and CBS All Access. And as if there are not enough competitors vying for your TV dollars, it was recently reported that Apple has decided it has identified the next big thing; producing original TV content. Are you kidding me? I understand that self-driving cars and streaming over-the-top video and virtual reality could all very well be huge markets over the long term. But everyone can’t be a winner. Do you really think GM and Ford lack the ability to produce self-driving, electric cars? Are the Big Three auto makers going to be replaced by Apple, Google, and Tesla a decade from now? Are we really going to cancel our Comcast service and pay the same amount of money for less content by buying subscriptions to 6 or 8 streaming services? The leading tech companies got to where they are today by being laser-focused on creating or improving upon one big tech trend. Becoming indispensable in that arena has made them billions of dollars and created a ton of shareholder wealth. They did not win out after a long, brutal battle with the other tech titans at the time. The biggest risk to Apple, for example, is that the innovation they are focused on revolves solely around virtual reality, electric cars, and streaming TV and movies. That is not how Apple became Apple. And it is not the secret for them to stay at the top. The same goes for Google and Microsoft and Facebook. As long as these companies are battling against each other, as opposed to paving their own way to the future, I am afraid that those of us hoping for the next big thing to come out of the mega tech stalwarts may be disappointed. To truly develop a market-leading position you have to try something new and do so long before everyone else. Nobody is likely to catch Amazon in the public cloud computing space (although Google and Microsoft are trying, of course).

I may have made up the other two, as well.) So along those lines, maybe Advanced Micro Devices Chief Executive Lisa Su should get cracking on a tome of her own. I’ll even suggest a title: “Zen And The Art Of Making AMD Relevant Again.” We can work out terms later, Lisa. Now, that title might not be too far from reality, because Zen, one of AMD’s newest chipsets, has gotten a lot of love this week. At a company event on Wednesday, Su touted how much better the Zen chips perform than their predecessor, and laid the ground work for what could be a big year for AMD’s products in 2017. And by Friday, investors had bought the story, sending AMD’s shares up 8.2 percent to close at $7.62. With Friday’s gains added to the mix, AMD’s stock price has surged 165.5 percent this year. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Stock Price | FindTheCompany Now, it’s hard to talk about AMD without getting into a lot of technical speak about things like gigahertz speed and the number of cores on the chipset. The bottom line for the average person is this: AMD is making good products that perform well, and it has found an industry (high-performance computing and graphics) where it can put its technological wherewithal to work and capitalize on areas not completely overrun by Intel. AMD is pushing its Zen chips toward high-end gaming computers, servers in the data center and thin laptops. Business has been decent enough that it might be safe to say that AMD has turned the proverbial corner. When the company reported second-quarter results in July, it posted a profit of $69 million, or 8 cents a share, a complete turnaround from the loss of $181 million, or 23 cents a share, that AMD reported in the same period a year ago. Revenue in the quarter also rose to $1.03 billion, a 9 percent gain from year-ago sales of $942 million. In fact, AMD has enough moxie right now that the company chose to show off Zen at its own event in San Francisco at the same time that Intel was holding its annual developers forum just a few blocks away. If Zen ends up panning out like many expect, Su will have brought a sense of zen to AMD that it hasn’t felt in years. Middle Innings: Maybe It’s Pay-To-Click?: By now, most everyone has at least heard of Windows 10, Microsoft’s latest version of its computer operating system. What everyone apparently hasn’t heard of, or cared about, is Edge. No, not The Edge, the guitarist for U2 (Who, let’s be frank, would only show up at an Apple event, anyway). This Edge is a new web browser that Microsoft has included with Windows 10 and it wants people to use it. So much so that the software giants is willing to pay you to put Edge to work. Here’s what’s up: Microsoft has re-branded its Bing Rewards program in which people could get paid for using Bing as their search engine, as Microsoft Rewards. Now, you can get “paid” if you use Bing, shop at the Microsoft store, or use Bing. Yeah, you’re right, it sounds kind of like one of those grocery-store promotions where you collect points based on how much you spend and you can then use those points toward something like a gallon of milk or a bag of Bugles. Under Microsoft Rewards, if you use Edge for up to 30 hours a month — and Microsoft will track your Edge usage — you can then get points that can be used to purchase things at places like Starbucks and Amazon. So, start surfing with Edge. After 30 hours, you might qualify for a Starbucks tall coffee! Or, you could just save some time and stay with Chrome or Safari or Firefox and just go to that Starbucks that is probably outside your office in 10 minutes or less. Bottom Of The Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday… Movin’ On Up: In addition to AMD, gains came from Applied Materials, Accuray, A10 Networks, Ultra Clean Holdings and FormFactor. In The Red: Decliners included QuinStreet, Nektar Therapeutics, Jive Software, Lending Club and Harmonic. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.8 points to 5,238 The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 45 points to close at 18,552. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 3 points to end the day at 2,183. Quote Of The Day: “I want to apologize for my behavior last weekend — for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning.” — U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte, who apologized on Instagram Friday for his lack of care and candor with regard to his claim that he and three other swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janiero last week.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 19, 2016 3:22pm   Comments Share: Related INTC Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot Intel Corporation, Mobileye May Be Star-Crossed Lovers, But Chowdhry Calls Veronian Tragedy Can Intel Counter The Zen Threat? (Seeking Alpha) CLSA's Christopher Caso commented on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s recent autonomous driving effort after visiting Intel's Developer Forum. Although the analyst highlighted the lack of details or plans for Intel's proposed autonomous driving initiative, he said the company was serious about entering the space. Intel sees itself competing with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) and others, according to Caso. In order to prepare for the transformation, Intel intends to move from a distributed computing architecture to a centralized "server-like architecture" with strong links to the cloud, according to the CLSA analyst. Additionally, Intel plans to work with Mobileye on the recently announce BMW autonomous vehicle project, while competing with suppliers such as Nvidia and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI). Related Link: Intel's Developer Forum Impresses Deutsche Bank 2 Years In A Row Taking Down Nvidia "For the third time in two days, Intel made the case that its Xeon Phi architecture was a more suitable solution than Nvidia's GPU for deep learning applications," stated Caso. Intel management argued its CPU capabilities would lead to reduced latency and full use of system memory would bring more value than Nvidia. "INTC feels that a combination of CPU and FPGA will be a more effective solution than the use of a GPU," said Caso. The analyst claimed Intel's argument had merit, but also highlighted Nvidia's increasing strength, putting the company on the radar of many competitors. The analyst reiterated Intel's Underperform rating and $35.00 price target. At time of writing, Intel traded at $35.18, up 0.60 percent Friday. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Granted, last-generation CPUs are cool, silent and power-efficient. Anecdotal evidence: my new laptop, a brand new MacBook, is about as fast as the Dell ultrabook it replaced. The problem? I bought the Dell laptop some five years ago. The Dell was thicker and noisier, its battery never lasted longer than a few hours, but it was about as fast as the new MacBook. Editor’s Note: Guest author Oleg Afonin works for Russian software developer Elcomsoft. The company is well known for its password recovery tools and forensic solutions. This article was originally published on the Elcomsoft blog. Computer games have evolved a lot during the last years. Demanding faster and faster video cards, today’s games are relatively lax on CPU requirements. Manufacturers followed the trend, continuing the performance race. GPUs have picked up where CPUs have left. Nvidia recently released their new GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card based on the new Pascal architecture. Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery 3.20 added support for the new architecture. What does it mean for us? GPU Acceleration: The Present and Future of Computer Forensics Today’s desktop video cards pack significantly more grunt compared to contemporary desktop CPUs. The powerful GPU units can deliver unmatched performance in massively parallel computations, offering 100 to 200 times greater performance compared to CPUs. All this performance is still relatively useless when it comes to regular computing. The several hundred individual GPU cores are built specifically for “one code, different data” scenarios, while general-use CPUs can run different code on each kernel. Since breaking passwords involves executing the same code repeatedly, just with different data (encryption keys or passwords), a large array of GPU units makes lots of sense. How does it scale to real-world applications? A low-end Nvidia or AMD board will deliver 20 to 40 times the performance of the most powerful Intel CPU. A high-end accelerator such as the Nvidia GTX 1080 can crack passwords up to 250 times faster compared to a CPU alone. Just how important is GPU acceleration, exactly? As an example, a common 6-character password (lower-case letters with numbers) has just about 2 billion combinations. If that password protects a Microsoft Office 2013 document, you’ll spend 2.2 years trying all possible combinations. Using the same computer, add a single GTX 1080 card, and the same password will be cracked in under 83 hours. That’s 3.5 days vs. 2.2 years! Nvidia Pascal Architecture Nvidia’s latest GPU architecture gives a significant performance boost compared to Nvidia’s previous flagship. With 21 half-precision teraflops, GTX 1080 boards are 1.5 to 2 times faster breaking passwords compared to GTX 980 units. According to ElcomSoft’s internal benchmarks, Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery can try 7,100 passwords per second for Office 2013 documents using a single Nvidia GTX 1080 board compared to 3,800 passwords per second on an Nvidia GTX 980. When recovering RAR 5 passwords, using a single GTX 1080 results in 25,000 passwords per second compared to 13,000 passwords per second on a GTX 980. Cannot see the numbers for CPU-based benchmarks without a magnifying glass? In case you wonder, we were only able to try 30 (yes, thirty) MS Office 2013 passwords per second on an Intel Xeon E5 2603 without GPU acceleration. Compare that to 7,100 passwords per second using a single Nvidia GTX 1080 board! Nvidia Pascal is a major break-through in GPU computations. If you need a reliable powerhouse to break passwords faster, consider adding a GTX 1080 board to your workstation. What if your computer already has a GTX 980 installed? If you have a free PCIe slot and sufficient cooling, and if your computer’s power supply can deliver enough juice for an extra GTX 1080 board, then you can just add the new board without removing the old one. Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery will use both GPUs together for even faster attacks. Does it make sense keeping a GTX 980 along with the new GTX 1080? By keeping the old card together with the new GTX 1080, you’ll get an additional performance boost of about 20 to 30 percent. Whether this extra performance is worth the increased power consumption and excess heat is debatable, but if your power supply and cooling can reliably manage both cards working at their maximum performance, by all means go for it!

Qualcomm officials are continuing to get the company ready to take on Intel and its position as the dominant supplier of processors for the data center. The company this week announced that it has created a new business center group that will be focused on efforts in the data center, such as providing chips for servers and other enterprise systems. The Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies unit will be a subsidiary of Qualcomm. In addition, Qualcomm officials said the company's upcoming family of ARM-based systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) for the server will be given the name Centriq, and added that Qualcomm engineers were on track with the previously stated goal of sampling production silicon by the end of the year. The moves are important steps for Qualcomm and the larger community of ARM server chip suppliers as they look to carve into Intel's position as the world's top server chip supplier. It's a big market, projected by industry analysts to grow to $18 billion by 2020, and right now, Intel chips run more than 95 percent of all servers. Competitors and analysts have said that OEMs and end-user organizations are looking for second suppliers of silicon and alternatives to Intel to help drive innovation and keep controls of pricing. ARM officials several years ago said that its low-power chip designs—which can be found in most of the chips that run smartphones and tablets—would be that second option, particularly for high-end hyperscale companies and service providers, who put a premium on not only performance but also energy efficiency. There are some 64-bit ARM-based data center chips on the market from such vendors as Cavium and Applied Micro, with some moving into their second and third generations. The effort got a boost this week when Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced it was using Applied Micro's X-Gene SoCs in its new StoreVirtual 3200 virtualized infrastructure offering. Qualcomm officials in 2014 announced their intention to enter into the ARM server push, with an eye toward hyperscale data center environments running workloads as big data, machine learning, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). The move was significant because it involved a vendor with the financial resources to take on Intel and a highly recognizable name. It also came around the same time that Samsung Electronics reportedly decided to end its plans for the market. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices recently decided to put off its work around ARM-based server chips to put more resources and effort behind re-energizing its x86 chip business, including the development of the new "Zen" microarchitecture. In an interview this week with eWEEK in San Francisco, blocks from where Intel was holding its Intel Developer Forum, Anand Chandrasekher, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's Data Center Group, said having the data center business operating as a subsidiary enables it to be more nimble in such areas as customer relations and technology decision-making. Many of the needs of smartphone users are different from those of enterprises looking for data center products, Chandrasekher said. He also said moving into the data center is an important step for the company at a time when such trends as cloud computing, the proliferation of mobile devices and the internet of things (IoT) are blurring the lines between consumer and corporate technologies. Qualcomm is the world's largest vendor of silicon for such devices as smartphones and tablets and is growing in the emerging IoT space, giving it a strong presence at the edge of the network, Chandrasekher said. With the growth of the cloud, "all of these things are connected to the data center, and we really needed to have a presence in the data center," he said. Chandrasekher noted that while Qualcomm officials have not talked a lot about their server plans since announcing them in November 2014, there has been a lot going on behind the scenes. The company in October 2015 began sampling a pre-production version of a 24-core chip based on a custom ARMv8 design with select customers and partners, and also announced partnerships with Xilinx for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Mellanox Technologies for Ethernet and InfiniBand interconnect technologies. The company earlier this year also has announced a joint venture with the Guizhou Province in China to design, build and sell server chipsets in the Chinese market, and helped establish the Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) consortium to create open compute and accelerator standards. Other members are AMD, IBM, Xilinx, Mellanox, ARM and Huawei.             LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Microsoft Plans to Build a Quantum Computer Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

High-End HP Omen X Design Shows Why There's a Future for Desktop PCs For those who want a high-end computing experience or do-it-yourselfers who like the idea of swapping components to boost performance and capabilities, here's why the Omen X may be the desktop for you. An Interesting Design Concept The HP Omen X has an interesting design concept. The device is shaped like a cube and sits on a stand that keeps it propped up on one corner to help it run cooler and to save it from looking like another boring PC box or tower. There are some esthetically pleasing grills on the front to aid ventilation and access ports on the back to enable users to readily open it up. It Includes Windows 10—With a Catch The HP Omen X runs on Windows 10. However, the computer will have Windows 10 Home out of the box rather than Windows 10 Pro. Those who want all the features in Windows 10 Pro can upgrade for just $39. It would've been nice to see Windows 10 Pro as a standard feature in such a high-end model. The Graphics Chips Are Powerful The graphics performance in the Omen X is nothing short of astounding. Customers can choose up to dual Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 chips or up to dual AMD Radeon R9 Fury X processing units. In either case, the GPUs will be able to handle everything from video editing and processing to gaming. It Supports Virtual Reality Devices, Applications As more virtual-reality headsets reach the market, computer buyers are seeking out models that are VR-ready. However, virtual reality currently requires extremely powerful processors and not all Windows PCs are VR-certified. The Omen X, is and that could help it sell well among virtual-reality-seekers. It's Fully Upgradable The Omen X is a fully upgradable computer, HP says. In fact, users will be able to quickly swap out core components, such as CPUs, graphics processors and storage drives, to boost performance. Interestingly, HP is encouraging customizing the computer and offering toolless access to internal components. There's also a built-in toolkit to help users quickly change up their components. HP's Augmented Cooling Features in Omen X In a high-end computer like the Omen X, cooling is an important factor, especially to gamers who want their computers to run cool to deliver the fastest performance. To keep the computer running cool, HP has designed a "tri-chamber" infrastructure that separates components and includes cooling in each of those chambers. In addition, customers can get up to three 120mm liquid-cooling radiators with exhaust vents to keep cool air in and hot air out. Choose the Right Processor to Get the Job Done HP is offering a wide selection of processors, depending on what customers want. The company says customers can choose from either the sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors, and have the option to choose from several variants within them. In addition, the overclocking is available for those who want a bit more power. You Can Buy Omen X Shell to Add Custom Components In an interesting twist, HP says that it will sell completely empty Omen X boxes for those who want to install components of their choosing. The idea is to bring back the days of building a computer from scratch, and it could prove extremely appealing to do-it-yourselfers who still enjoy crafting their own machines. HP Has Inked an Omen X Customization Deal With Maingear HP has signed a deal with boutique PC maker Maingear for customers to get even more customized Omen X desktops. Maingear will apparently offer more component options and other customizations that HP's site won’t have. The companies say Maingear will begin selling its Omen X in early 2017 and pricing will vary depending on custom component selections. Let's Look at Pricing and Availability The Omen X is available now to customers ready to pay extra for a high-end desktop. The cheapest option is available now for $1,800. However, those who want some of the sophisticated features mentioned in the earlier slides should expect to pay substantially more. In fact, buyers who select top-of-the-line CPUs, graphics chips and other components can expect to pay several thousand dollars.

The desktop is notable for its cubed design and a stand that allows it to sit on one corner to help it run cool. In addition, the desktop comes with high-end components, including the latest Intel processors, powerful graphics chips and more than enough RAM for most users. Given those features, it's perhaps no surprise that with a starting price of $1,799, the Omen X isn't cheap. However, it's an ideal choice either for those who want a high-end computing experience or do-it-yourselfers who like the idea of swapping components to boost performance and capabilities. In fact, if its design says anything, it's that the HP Omen X was built to last and work productively on the desktop for years to come. This eWEEK slide show covers the main features in the Omen X that make it one of the more interesting and appealing computers to hit the desktop market in some time.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

Kids are begging their parents for new clothes and kicks. And teachers are frantically organizing their classrooms in the last few days of summer. It is that time of year again -- back-to-school season is upon us, like it or not. If you are looking to pick up some new tech gear for you or a loved one for the impending school year, but do not want to do all of the homework necessary to find that perfect product, do not sweat it, we have got you covered. This is Hot Hardware's personal study guide to help you choose the perfect laptop, tablet, 2-in-1, desktop, gadget, or accessory. Think of it as the "cliffs notes" for tech shoppers...  We will start with a look at some thin and light laptops that are perfect for carrying from class-to-class and coffee shop. Then we will examine the tablets and 2-in-1 devices that make reading, typing, drawing, and presenting a breeze. Next, we will check out the desktops that are perfect for a dorm room or office space. If you enjoy gaming during your study breaks, we have a few gaming/DTR options you will want to see as well. Finally, we will inspect the perfect accessories, gadgets, and gear to help make school life a little easier. Thin And Light Notebooks It is incredibly important for a student to have a laptop that is thin and light enough to lug across campus, but also powerful enough to address all of their needs. We have provided a list below of devices that should fit the bill, whether you need something ultra thin with long battery life, or something a little bigger that packs more muscle. All of these devices provide solid user experiences while still being light enough to tote around almost anywhere.  Dell XPS 13 ($899+) And XPS 15 ($999+) The Dell XPS 13 and XPS 15 are both well-balanced laptops. These are some lean, mean, fightin’ machines that do not compromise on performance or premium aesthetics. Both laptops are made of sturdy CNC machined aluminum and carbon fiber, feature gorgeous, near bezeless Infinity Edge displays, and are fairly light. The XPS 13 and XPS 15 are offered with an array of Skylake-based Intel processors and NVMe Solid State storage.  One of the main differences between the devices -- other than screen size, of course -- is the optional NVIDIA discrete graphics in the XPS 15. This add-on is perfect for gamers who do not feel like carrying around a big and beastly device, but still want the benefits of a dedicated GPU. The XPS 13 and XPS 15 are premium devices, with price tags to match, but these are some of the best notebooks we have ever used.   Check out the review for the XPS 13 here and the XPS 15 here HP Spectre 13: $1,245.00+ USD If you are looking for an incredibly light laptop that still packs a punch, the HP Spectre 13 may be for you. HP claims that the Spectre 13 is currently the "world's thinnest" notebook. This notebook boasts a 1080P WLED-backlit screen, Bang & Olufsen Premium Sound, Quad Speakers, and a full-size island-style backlit keyboard that feel quite good despite the limited throw of the keys. The 8GB of LPDDR3-1600 memory and Intel HD Graphics 520 are unlikely to impress gamers, however, this is a great laptop for the student who does not game much and wants something ultra-portable and sleek. Here, for the full review Lenovo X1 Yoga ($1200+) or Lenovo X1 Yoga OLED ($1650+) The Lenovo X1 Yoga or X1 Yoga OLED is great for students who want a device that can easily be used in multiple modes, thanks to its innovative 360-degree hinge design. This laptop comes with a stylus that is powered by WACOM and features Active Capacitive technology, 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity, and integrated left and right-click buttons. Per Lenovo, 15 seconds of charging will allow the ThinkPad Pen Pro to operate for 100-minutes, and it can fully charge in 5 minutes, for up to 19 hours of use. Its dual hinge mechanism swings smoothly through its full 360 degree range and the laptop resists movement when shaken or moved, regardless of what mode is used. The Lenovo X1 Yoga or X1 YOGA OLED would work well for graphic design duties or for a business major who needs a device with the horsepower of a laptop, flexibility of a tablet, and a stylus to help keep those creative juices flowing. Here, for a full review HP Spectre x360 15t: Starting at $1549 USD The HP Spectre x360 15t is another well-balanced machine.  The high-quality keyboard and touchpad, excellent touch display, and multiple positioning options are great for industrious students who need a little flexibility in their device. This ultrabook also performed well in our testing. The HP Spectre x360 15t would therefore suit a student who works hard in the classroom, but also likes to blow off a little steam with some casual gaming. Here, for the full review ASUS Zenbook UX 305CA: Starting at $749 USD If you need a laptop with good looks and excellent battery life, then the ASUS Zenbook UX 305CA will be appealing to you. In our Battery Eater pro test the laptop hung in for four hours and twenty-five minutes and lasted ten hours and nine minutes in our web browsing test. The Zenbook’s specs are fairly modest, but this machine is about being reliably productive for long stretches, untethered to an electrical outlet. The ASUS Zenbook UX 305CA’s light and compact frame, killer battery life, and affordability make this the ideal laptop for the busy, budget-conscious undergrad or harried grad student who wants a premium looking device, without the premium price. Here, for a full review If gaming is as important to you as studying, check out or next few picks for gaming and desktop replacement laptops.   NEXT PAGE Article Index:    Back To School Essentials, Notebooks And More Gaming And Desktop Replacement Laptops Tablets And 2-in-1 PCs Desktop PC Systems Accessories, Gadgets, and Gears Tags:  shopping, Notebooks, Desktop, Laptops, accessories, tablets, 2-in-1, roundup, back-to-school Related content Hot Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Tablets, Smartphones, Laptops, and Systems Huawei Honor 8 Review: A Stylish, Affordable Android Smartphone Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10 Pop And Performance WD My Passport Wireless Pro Review: Portable Storage For Mobile Devices Adventures With Dell's Rugged PC Line-Up Comments Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Ubuntu Based Zorin OS 12 Linux Could Be...32 Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But...11 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple...9 Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7...8 NVIDIA Offers Free Gears Of War 4...5 Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on...4 Stanford Study Shows That Students Are...4 FEATURED Hot Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Tablets,...

The portable, open-source ORWL could be what you're looking for If you're paranoid about someone gaining physical access to your computer, the palm-sized ORWL could put your mind at ease. By Liam Tung | August 19, 2016 -- 12:27 GMT (05:27 PDT) | Topic: Security The ORWL locks down data on the device and contains measures to counteract tampering. Image: Design Shift There are a number of choices available if you need a small, powerful, yet affordable mini desktop PC, from the $500 Mac Mini, to the cheaper Google Chromebox, or HP Pavilion Mini desktop. But can more be done to keep these devices secure, not just from the risk of software exploits but also scenarios in which an attacker has gained physical access to the device? The makers of ORWL, a flying saucer-shaped mini desktop for the security-minded, think it can, providing you're willing to fork out a relatively hefty $699. ANDROID SECURITY Google has an Android security problem Security is everyone's responsibility, not just those with the cash to upgrade. Read More The team behind the ORWL is taking a second crack at crowdfunding, after the project failed to meet a $175,000 target on Kickstarter last year. This time, the ORWL has a more modest target of $25,000 on Crowd Supply. ORWL, whose name is inspired by George Orwell, is billed by its maker Design Shift as the first "physically secure computer" due to the lengths the company has taken to lock down data stored on the device. The device sports an Intel Skylake Core m3 processor, as well as 8GB RAM, and either 120GB or 480GB SSD. It has two USB 3.0 Type C ports, one Micro HDMI port, and supports 4K output. The system can run Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux systems, Windows 10, or the security-focused Qubes OS. Key to the device's physical security features is a secure microcontroller (MCU), which is used to store and generate the drive's cryptographic key. According to Design Shift, the MCU is integrated into the motherboard and verifies the integrity of firmware prior to boot. The other key physical security layer is a so-called 'active mesh' clamshell that encases the gadget. The case borrows from techniques used to physically protect ATMs and security tokens. The material contains a printed circuit board that will shatter when drilled, triggering instructions for the MCU to delete the drive's encryption key. Try to pry the clamshell open and the device's data will be rendered inaccessible in the same fashion. The ORWL doesn't offer any of the fancier biometric methods for authentication, but instead relies on a paired NFC chip held on a key fob for authentication. The device uses Bluetooth to monitor the proximity of the key fob. If the key fob moves out of range, the device will lock down until the next time the NFC chip is in range again. Finally, to assure buyers of the ORWL's integrity, the company is promising to open source its hardware and software. This includes schematic and layout files, as well as the firmware for the BIOS, secure controller, and key fob. But while Apple, Google, and Microsoft are doubling-down on security features for their respective platforms, it's not clear that equipment with security as its main selling point is anything more than a niche product, even after Edward Snowden's leaks about US surveillance capabilities. Silent Circle, the maker of the encrypted Blackphone, recently revealed weak sales of its device. BlackBerry has also struggled to find a market for its security-focused, Android-powered BlackBerry Priv, though it's taken a second punt on the market with its DTEK50.

Narain, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Berg Last week, I participated in a panel discussion on innovation versus implementation at the inaugural Precision Medicine Leaders’ Summit in San Diego. As I spent time speaking with world-class researchers and leaders in the industry I was reminded that although we’ve made many scientific advances, the pharma industry has been slow to implement emerging technologies. And like many industries slow to adopt new technology the pharma industry is overdue for its own disruption.   The current drug development process in the pharma industry is inefficient and unsustainable. It takes 10 to 15 years and $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market. A majority of those costs are coming from failed trials with an over 90 percent failure rate.  The current healthcare system cannot sustain the rising costs of drug development and more importantly patients do not have time to wait for treatments to be developed. Something has to change.     Emerging technologies are dramatically changing the landscape of innovation across all fields of industry. Pharma has lagged behind when it comes to adopting and implementing new technological advancements such as artificial intelligence or machine learning. This has provided an opening in the pharma space that tech companies are looking to fill.  Apple, Intel and Google have all recently made large investments buying up AI startups. And while none of them have experience in drug development they are all aggressively positioning themselves to enter the healthcare marketspace.  Silicon Valley is accustomed to rapidly innovating and embracing new technologies and could very well surpass traditional pharma to disrupt the whole industry. In many ways the pharma industry is stuck in its model of discovery and development. The costs and pressures to create successful drugs often leads to failed trials that run for too long. But it’s the “one size fits all” approach to drug prescription works for them. An approved drug may only benefit 10 percent of the patients, yet it is prescribed to the entire patient populations, and it is reimbursed by health plans irrespective of its actual clinical benefit.  Precision medicine allows more efficient delivery but also reduces the potential market size for that drug and, to a risk averse big pharma, this looks like bad business. The cumulative benefits of leveraging new technologies such as Molecularly Informed Therapeutics in drug development will outweigh the costs and will elevate those companies willing to take the risks and disrupt the status quo. It begins with discovery. Instead of the traditional hypothesis and chemical library based approaches to drug discovery we need to study the biology of disease in an agnostic way and let the patient biology guide discovery, a “back to biology” approach. By collecting data from both healthy and diseased biological samples using high throughput multi-omic mass spectrometers we can build a massive data set of patient biology at the molecular level. By combining this data with genomic and patient records we can analyze the data using artificial intelligence algorithms. In this analysis we can interrogate the differences between the healthy and diseased states to discover key biomarkers to investigate allowing us to skip the chemical screening process reducing costs and time in the discovery process. It continues with development. This combination of molecular systems biology with a focus on the phenome and machine learning technology is key to driving a new model of drug development. This platform not only allows for faster discovery, but when used in clinical trials can help stratify the patient population through clinical diagnostics to allow for the selection of patients that will respond to a treatment. This will help produce more successful trial results while also better defining the patient population that will benefit from the treatment. It ends by helping the patient. The world of big business driven by the need for profits can lose sight of the goal of helping improve the lives of patients in need. But by disrupting the industry through these emerging technologies we can deliver treatments to patients in a precision way improving outcomes while also reducing the overall healthcare costs. This can all be done while still working within a sustainable business model. Companies that are willing to take these initial risks and implement these emerging technologies will realize these benefits by reducing the time and costs to develop drugs. While drugs developed may serve a smaller population the overall success rate of drug trials will improve and this increased efficiency will benefit the bottom line. Using prescriptive analytics derived from clinical data physicians will be able to determine the best treatment option for patients and reduce the overall costs that currently burden the system in hospital admissions due to toxic side effects or ineffective drug performance.

By Andy Swift / June 20 2016, 7:00 PM PST 65 Lola was determined to help Mary assassinate Elizabeth on Monday’s Reign finale, and even though history tells us that plan was doomed to fail, there were still plenty of deadly developments in the final hour of the CW drama’s third season. RELATEDThe CW Fall Premiere Dates: Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, TVD and More Following a bungled attempt at taking out her supposed “friend,” Lola was thrown into the dungeon, where she had some harsh final words for Elizabeth: “I march to my execution very soon, yet you are the one to be pitied.” She assured Elizabeth that her love of power will leave her forever alone, a point hammered home by Dudley’s subsequent revelation: He’s already remarried. RELATEDReign Season 4 Intel: Meet Mary’s New Suitors, Among Other Key Players — Plus: Who’s Being Recast? I have to say, I didn’t think Reign was capable of producing a more heartbreaking scene than Mary’s goodbye to Francis, but I was proven dead wrong — poor choice of words? — after watching Narcisse witness his wife’s beheading. And her final words (“Protect my son! Tell John I love him. Tell him every day!”) will likely haunt Narcisse for the rest of his life. You know, because that guy needs more personal demons. A LIMITED ENGAGEMENT | But Lola isn’t the only character joining Francis, King Henry and Aylee (remember her?!) in the Great Beyond — at least not if Leith’s cliffhanger ending develops the way it appears to be. After saving Catherine from the Red Knights and receiving her blessing to marry Claude, who was already laying out her wedding dress in a heartbreaking montage, the former baker was stabbed and left for dead in the snow. Her name was the last word he uttered while crawling on the ground, which either means their love will be enough to sustain him… or this really was goodbye. Time will tell! BYE BYE, BASH | Speaking of goodbyes, Monday’s finale also marked Torrance Coombs’ last episode as a series regular, though his send-off was slightly less grand than some fans (me!) might have hoped. After finally accepting that he can see things others cannot — did any fellow Game of Thrones fans get Jaqen H’ghar vibes from that creepy, old-faced lady? — Bash agreed to leave Mary and take up the life of a druid, making one final promise: “I will come to you when you need me the most. Of this, I am sure.” So I guess this is just goodbye… for now? ONE BAD MOTHER | We’ve received glimpses of Catherine’s softer side over the years, but we certainly didn’t see much of it during Monday’s finale. When she wasn’t slapping Charles in the face, demanding that he stand up for himself and his country, she was reminding him how easily replaceable he is. In fact, her final scene found her practically dangling his younger brother in front of his face, cuing up a twisted shift in the Catherine/Charles dynamic for Season 4. (And who doesn’t love a good twist?) OK, let’s hear your take on Reign‘s eventful finale: Were you devastated by Lola’s death? Do you think Leith will survive? And what are your hopes for Season 4?

Lola was always my least favorite thanks to the affair but this was sad. I think season 4 will be interesting. Reply Ian says: June 20, 2016 at 8:13 PM Lol. You’re me. Lola and Kenna were always my least faves. Reply Ash says: June 21, 2016 at 12:43 AM That was not only sad to watch but I was annoyed with how naive they suddenly made Lola’s character tonight. Her believing, without question, that Mary would actually ask HER (her oldest & dearest friend) to murder a Queen & almost certainly die herself??? I just found that very hard to believe even if it was in their “secret code”. She’s been around the ropes long enough & dealt with the likes of Narcisse & Catherine but she fell for something like this…. Something so out of character for Mary. I just found that scenario a little hard to swallow. I guess they had to find a way to kill her (or someone) off in a way that would pit the 2 queens against each other & this was the best they came up with???? Oh well… JMHO. Lola’s forgiveness of Narcisse seemed very rushed as well after all this time. I just felt like they tried to tie up loose ends far too quickly over these last couple episodes (certainly the finale) and left me scratching my head wondering what just happened bc so much of it seems out of character for those particular characters & just completely out of left field. Sort of like the writers knew where they wanted to be at the end of the season & got to the last couple episodes & said “uh oh. We’re way behind! Let’s do bla bla bla to these characters so we end where we need to end” and didn’t think it through as far as character development & character/story consistency. Just my two cents though. :-) Reply Naazneen (@miss_naazneen) says: June 21, 2016 at 8:43 AM Wish I could click ‘like’. ITA. Lola spent most of her time in England talking about how much she hated her husband. Then suddenly she loved him again. I completely AGREE with the idea that she was painted as painfully naive in these final episodes. I was saying the same thing to someone today. Lola is arguably the most moral character on the show. For HER to be asked to kill Elizabeth was absurd. Also, telling Narcisse – WHO HAD RECENTLY SEEN MARY – would easily have solved the conundrum. FFS, Mary would sooner have asked Narcisse to kill Mary than Lola. Really, really shoddy writing. We dont know the circumstances around the actress, but another female character killed. Torrence is leaving the show. I assumed he might be the fatality. Reply H says: June 21, 2016 at 11:45 AM I think they are reducing the cast for money reasons. Most of the new players in Scotland will probably be recurring rather than regulars, and there is no need for some of the old characters. Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:13 AM Yes!!! Great points you made! Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:15 AM Torrence is leaving too?! Ugh! I’m so done with this show. Over it! Reply TMIZ says: June 27, 2016 at 8:04 AM Exactly! I’m so annoyed right now! Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:12 AM Yes!!! You nailed it girlfriend. Lol..I couldn’t have said it better myself. I mean, really?? What a joke! Lola couldn’t have even TRIED to find out if she was being deceived before she completely trusted a total stranger, who completely threw her under the bus as soon as they took him to the dungeon. Give me a break! Unnecessary. Annoying, aggravating! Reply Julie P says: June 25, 2016 at 8:12 AM I felt the same way. That Lola didn’t question it more bothered me, especially since she was a mother. I can’t believe they have written off all of Mary’s ladies, their side stories kept me watching when Mary’s got annoying. Reply Alexids says: June 27, 2016 at 10:58 PM I agree with a lot of things you said. I pretty much felt the same way. I do understand how she forgave Narcisse. With her situation the way it was. They’ve been separated a while and time has a way of healing old wounds. Then she knew it was a good chance she would die especially if they were caught. When your out in life or death situations everything seems so insignificant. Plus you always want to leave off on a good note with the person who’ll be raising your child once your gone. The whole Mary asking her to kill Elizabeth had me flabbergasted. Especially think about how she’s seen some of the next evil masterminds at work. Like really. But looking back we’ve seen her be manipulated in the past. The way Narcisse tricked her into marriage. Just because you hang with big dogs doesn’t make you one. Just means you might be coming home with some nasty bites if your not careful. Plus the message was coded. Not even Elizabeth knew about the coded messages so why wouldn’t it be from Mary. Remember she’s not the brightest bulb in the bunch. And she didn’t have much time to think. One last thing. This season finale was cold blooded. I didn’t think they could too Francis death, but that was the best be heading since Anne Boleyn. Reply Kenny Lane says: October 22, 2016 at 7:29 PM I TOTALLY AGREE WITH EVERY THING THAT YOU SAID.💪😍‼️ Reply luv2cook says: June 20, 2016 at 7:16 PM I am BEYOND upset that they beheaded Lola and killed Leith! Reply Ian says: June 20, 2016 at 8:19 PM Just happy they left the door open for Bash to make appearances. I always felt like Mary and Francis were too hard a sell after he got Lola pregnant, and a full blown romance with Bash was something they always denied Mash shippers, even though Adelaide and Torrance have had the easiest chemistry of Mary and her few suitors. Was never a fan of Leith and Claude. His best was his first with Greer, so they may as well kill him off. Reply bee says: June 20, 2016 at 11:03 PM don’t get your hopes up too high, they already cast Mary’s next husband http://tvline.com/2016/06/07/reign-will-kemp-lord-darnley-season-4-cast/ Reply Daphne says: June 21, 2016 at 8:28 AM Pretty sure Torrance comes back as a guest star though… https://twitter.com/torrancecoombs/status/707682287551275008 Reply Georgia Smith says: June 20, 2016 at 8:51 PM Rather underwhelming finale. Killed off Lola (did we really need to see the headless dress to know she was beheaded?)…Bash moves on….Mary picks up again with the smarmy Gideon…Catherine emotionally devastates yet another offspring. The only real cliffhanger is Leith….Does he survive or not? I think the writers could have made this a bit more of a teaser to get me back next season…especially since we all know how this story eventually ends. Reply Ash says: June 21, 2016 at 12:23 AM I’m thinking they may take some “artistic freedom” with the eventual ending after watching this episode. I foresee Bash’s training allowing him to be seen as “whoever he needs to be seen as” like the old lady Druid in tonight’s episode & that he will eventually use that gift/skill to take Mary’s place at the beheading. The Druid lady kept saying “if you truly want to help Mary” or “truly want to save Mary”. Then his statement about being there “when she needs him most”. I think they are setting us up for a big twist with her beheading. But then again I could be completely off & reading far too much into this. Ha ha! Reply Ash says: June 21, 2016 at 12:54 AM I mean they had to be making some type of point by showing the old Druid lady being able to look like Bash’s little girlfriend bc that random “girlfriend” had zero plot point other than for the old lady to eventually use her gift to look like her… and then the “helping/saving Mary” and “when you need me the most I’ll be there of that I’m certain” comments. I just think they are really setting us up for this to all come into play in a twist on Mary’s eventual death scene. My imagination may be running away on me though. Hmmmm. Reply Daphne says: June 21, 2016 at 8:33 AM I really hope you’re right! Knowing what happens to Mary Queen of Scots historically has always had me dreading the ending of this show… Your theory would allow for “historical accuracy” while also allowing for (the real) Mary secretly having some kind of happy ending (or at least survive) making fans happy (or at the very least happier than seeing Mary beheaded)! Reply Lily says: June 21, 2016 at 12:08 PM That teenybopper twist, probably will not happen. The decent thing about “Reign”, is they are not afraid to kill the main characters, when history stated they would die. Jeri says: June 21, 2016 at 2:11 PM I wish they did not feel compelled to be historically accurate. This is not a documentary and they would have more freedom for twists and surprises; Perhaps use history as a drawing board but with freedom to change outcomes when desired, Daphne says: June 21, 2016 at 2:51 PM I think they already stray from history quite a bit (Bash didn’t even exist irl, her ladies were all called Mary, etc.!) but they seem to stay true in the big strokes of it all. The fact is Mary Queen of Scots had quite a tragic life, so I wonder how much of it they’ll keep on the show… Or if it will be like an epilogue in writing at the end of the last episode so they don’t have to go into the thick of the drama of it all (imprisonment, beheading, etc.) Ash says: June 25, 2016 at 3:54 PM lily- well they have certainly pulled stunts like that before. We had ghosts running around the castle, people who can see the future & perform magic. A woman who could save herself from being apparently burned alive, Druids who can look like anyone the wish, Francis being brought back to life on one occasion. If they seemed concerned about historical accuracy, that idea wouldn’t have even crossed my mind. As long as it “seems” to the public that Mary has been beheaded, I think that’s the most historical accuracy the writers are concerned with. Also I’m about 20 years too old to be considered a teeny bopper. Ha ha Katherine Ann says: June 22, 2016 at 10:15 PM I agree, it was too graphic. That’s all I saw as I laid in bed thinking about the show, was Lola’s bloody headless body. I feel like all TV shows are going down the path of Game of Thrones and killing off all the main characters. The show is becoming displeasing to watch. Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:20 AM Totally! I am still awake at 4 AM thinking about it. Ugh! Yuck. Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:18 AM Lol! They just had to throw in the gory beheading… Really?? Game of Thrones wannabe maybe? Didn’t even work out..They couldn’t pull this episode off at al. Reply Priyam says: June 20, 2016 at 10:17 PM oh no poor Lola! Reply Nina says: June 21, 2016 at 4:57 AM You kill Lola, you kill my current reason to watch the show. And dying that way, no forgiveness asked to Elizabeth who has been a friend, no contact with Mary, just ruthless and no heart… No more girl, with Aylee and Lola dead, Kenna away pregnant by mr. noone and Greer… too. I have no interest i watching a fourth season with just Mary, idiot-Gideon, Elizabeth (i won’t never empathize with her again) and who else? Should have ended here. Good bye to an other show. Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:22 AM Touché Nina!!! Reply TMIZ says: June 27, 2016 at 8:02 AM Yeah, what pissed me off about Lola’s death was that the cause was so out of character! She would never have tried to kill anyone. She would have been like “this can’t be right” and just run I think. She already proved to be a total failure at subterfuge with the pearls incident. It just didn’t make sense to me. Reply regina rose says: June 21, 2016 at 4:58 AM Wow this cam go many ways Mary , she an Katherine are forces to be reckoned with Poor lola. Mary’s brother ??? Reply safistikaytdlayd says: June 21, 2016 at 5:48 AM Let Leith Live!!! Reply Daphne says: June 21, 2016 at 8:35 AM Petition for Leith to be next season’s Jon Snow!! Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:23 AM Not even close. Reply Daphne says: June 23, 2016 at 9:07 AM I obviously meant in a “left for dead but actually lives” way… There’s really no other comparison to be made between the 2! Reply Imzadi says: June 21, 2016 at 5:55 AM I liked Lola because she was Susan from the Narnia movies (she should have stayed and married Caspian–I would have!!!!). I can’t believe they killed her and might have killed Leith as well. And then for Bash to go off (we knew he had to because he’s in the Romeo & Juliet show!). Total disappointment. BTW Mary’s brother James is a regular on Good Witch, and the British assassin who gave Lola the pistol is also a regular on Good Witch (but his part was TINY!). Reply talia says: June 21, 2016 at 7:13 AM Watched this last week when it was released on Netflix here in the UK, not happy they killed Lola (hope to see Anna Popplewell in another tv show or film). Also hope that Leith survives as Claude deserves to be happy and because he is like the only character who isn’t corrupt in anyway. Reply Daphne says: June 21, 2016 at 8:25 AM Here’s hoping Leith is the new Jon Snow… Plus, I can’t help but wonder if the reason why they didn’t make a big deal of Bash leaving + Torrance’s tweet from back in March where he said: “Tough to comment on specifics, but I don’t think we’ve seen the last of Bash on #Reign.” is because he’ll actually be back next year in some guest star capacity? Reply April says: June 21, 2016 at 9:49 AM What with happen to narciesse? And will he take John to Marie?! Please tell me that she takes him in and takes care of him! Also wtf with laith that guy cannot catch a break he better live and finally get the love he deserves! Gahhh why didn’t Elizabeth just let Lola go?! That kills me to watch he die, I hope Marie’s brother claimed clean and tells her every thing so she can kill knox that lowly scum! Reply Vik says: August 7, 2016 at 5:55 AM YEEEEEES!!!!! I so agree with you!!! exactly! specially the part about Leith. He was alsways the good guy, right from the beginning! He doesn’t deserve to die!!!! He need’s to finally be happy! Reply Marie says: June 21, 2016 at 12:16 PM I’m not sure where Season 4 might go, but some of these comments got me thinking………. Francis’ death was such a heart-breaking moment that I wish the writers would do ANYTHING to bring him back!! Forget the historical politics and make some new waves! I’d love to see little Jean (John) return to Scotland under Mary’s care, she is the God-mother and he is King Francis’ only living child. And then Bash should transform his physical body into King Francis. It’s perfect! Team Frary and Team Mash both benefit, and the little boy gets a family. Now THAT would be some epic drama I’d love to watch in Season 4!! (Historically, Queen Mary didn’t marry until 5 years later, so there’s room for this scenario). Don’t bury Team Frary! Reply Sabrina says: June 21, 2016 at 1:38 PM I hated Lola’s death, she was a good character. Why wasn’t she more discreet Reply Brianne Clawson says: June 21, 2016 at 3:32 PM without bash I’m out Reply kataynagrimm says: June 23, 2016 at 4:25 AM Me too! Bash was the best eye candy… Why didn’t him and Mary hook back up?? Reply Daphne says: June 23, 2016 at 9:09 AM I ask myself that question pretty much every single episode… #Mabastian4eva Reply Cynthia says: June 21, 2016 at 6:36 PM Goodbye, for now, (Bash) Torrance Coombs. I love him but totally understand he needs more screen time. Good luck on your next endeavors! I will miss Lola but how much more could she do being in England? Narcisse having to see that was so heartbreaking for me. I wonder if he will blame Mary? I like the animosity they have towards one another. I hope he returns back to Scotland with Mary, so we know her and Francis’ son will be safe. Reply EJ says: June 22, 2016 at 6:34 AM The finale was wrapped up too quickly. So many questions left unanswered. How did Queen Elizabeth know where to send the invitation (execution) to Narcisse? Wasn’t he in England disguised as a Priest? Queen Mary receives report of Lola’s death & Narcisse imprisonment. She mourns her dear friends death. What about John the son of Francis? Who will raise him? Reply zainab says: June 23, 2016 at 12:33 AM I must say dat killing Lola n Leigh makes me very sad. I HV been watching reign since season1 episode 1,it really kps me going I love it very much but with Francie’s dying,Lola n Leigh is too much for me to bear.I just hope that season four will b interesting. Reply Shari says: June 23, 2016 at 3:19 PM I loved it!! I never believed Lola hated her husband. She was hurt and angry. But did not stop loving him. It was a very sad ending. I loved them together. If they put him back with Queen Catherine I will scream. I have loved this show from day one. Reply Rebby says: June 23, 2016 at 6:07 PM I think John Knox had Lola set up to kill Queen Elizabeth; and someone else had Leith set up to either die ir get seriously hurt with a stab wound. I don’t understand why Bash had to leave- doesn’t make sense. Reply Daphne says: July 4, 2016 at 10:23 AM Bash had to leave because the actor who plays him moved on to another TV series… Reply Kimmy perkind says: June 28, 2016 at 8:18 PM They did not have to kill Lola…. This was the worst season finale ever!!!! Narsisse and Lola were finally going to be happy!! The way this was written was heartbreaking and not in a good way… In a way making me not wanting to watch one more episode!!! How sad!!! Smh Reply Anne says: July 5, 2016 at 9:36 PM Of course they had to kill off Leith. in 1559, princess Claude married the duke of Lorraine. (At the age of eleven). Kind of easy to guess what’s going to happen next. Mary marries her cousin, has a kid, is widowed, gets married again, upsets the nobles, flees to England, is imprisoned by Elizabeth for nineteen years, then executed. Wish the writers would just ignore history & let everyone live happily ever after. Reply JAYLEEN says: July 6, 2016 at 7:21 PM I will miss lola, Regardless Reign always done an Amazing job! Reply Allie Lanzagarita says: July 9, 2016 at 8:29 AM I’m still hoping that its not yet goodbye for Bash. I love to look at Bash and Mary together. Reply Ribs says: July 10, 2016 at 6:59 AM Rest in peace Lola …….lm looking forward to the next season Reply Nina says: July 10, 2016 at 7:12 AM I am not. Reply COREY JOHNSON says: July 13, 2016 at 6:51 PM thank god that man stealing woman is gone. Reply Del says: August 8, 2016 at 11:33 PM I feel as though I’ve lost all my favorites. Greer, Leith and Sebastian! I do like how we’re seeing Scotland finally :3 How will Kenna ever find her husband though.. :\ Reply Christa says: August 9, 2016 at 6:08 AM Lola should not have died…. her character was amazing! Reply Ola says: August 19, 2016 at 5:04 AM Lola didn’t actually forgive her husband her hurt her too much but think of it this way if she died without anyone by her side who do you think would take care of Jean phillpe? So she told her husband that she loves him so he would take care of her son since his father is dead and mary is in Scotland and half of her friends are dead and the only one left is greer and she couldn’t possibly give her son to a prostitute so nars was her best choice and safest for her son ! But com’on baaash he was my fav 😭😭😭😭 I always hated Kenna so good she’s gone but baaaaash omg Ltrly who’s in the next season if they’re all dead 😂😂😂 Reply Nancy Richards says: October 25, 2016 at 7:19 PM So done with d show….not interesting anymore. Reply Christina Turner says: November 4, 2016 at 11:27 PM Oh how I hope for Leith to survive! I am also scared for Mary that Narcisse will come after her based on the false letter that was sent in her name to Lola. I can’t wait for the next season Reply Michelle says: November 16, 2016 at 12:21 AM It was heartbreaking for me to hear Lola’s last words as she met her fate in the season finale episode. I had grown fond of the character as she continued to develop and grow throughout the show. Most of the comments here mention her being naive by not questioning the coded letter and its authenticity. However, to me, I see a true loyal friend who was willing to give up her own life in a heartbeat to protect not just Mary, but also her country. She was brave, devoted, and full of love. I will miss her next season :,( Reply See More Comments Today's Hottest Stories 1The Voice Top 11 Results Recap: Did the Right Singer Get the Boot? 2NCIS' Bishop Reveals Her Secret Boyfriend: How Did Gibbs React? 3Dear This Is Us: Please Stop Hiding How Much Kate and Toby Weigh 4The Flash Recap: Cold, Hard Truths 5Dancing With the Stars Finale Recap: Did the Right Couple Win Season 23?

Plexistor’s software-defined memory combines DRAM and flash in one memory address space to deliver a higher “memory” capacity with persistent storage from the NAND/XPoint part. It is developing a software layer, its SDM platform, to present DRAM and memory-channel persistent storage - NAND DIMMs currently - as a single memory-class resource pool for use by existing - unaltered - applications to give them a 100 - 450 per cent- performance increase. SDM provides a multi-tier NVM file system with auto-tiering between DRAM and NVDIMM-N, and NVDIMM-F and SSDs. NVDIMM-N is a DRAM/flash hybrid memory module that saves DRAM data contents to NAND if there is a power failure, and accessed at DRAM speed. NVDIMM-F is a an all-flash DIMM such as Diablo’s Memory1. Applications can directly access the persistent storage media, bypassing the traditional storage IO stack, without creating an additional copy of the data in DRAM, as the persistent media is seen as part of the overall memory address space. In the future XPoint DIMMs will be tier 1 media for SDM while NVMe-connected external storage arrays would be in tier 2. Plexistor’s roadmap was described here and it included remote access to PM Bricks across a 100GbitE fabric. This is PMoF and uses RDMA over a 100Gbit/s switch connecting application servers, running the SDM software, and the PM Bricks, PM for Persistent Memory. Plexistor remote access scheme for PM bricks. Plexistor now says PMoF is ready and it has demonstrated an RDMA system at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco this week. It used a Mellanox Spectrum 100GbitE switch hooked up to PM Bricks via ConnectX4 NICs, delivering more than 1.6 million random 4KB IOPS at less than 6µs with throughput of 7GB/sec. This, it states, “is over an order-of-magnitude better than the recently announced rack-optimized Flash storage DSSD appliance, which offers 100µs latency.” CEO Sharon Azulai was not modest: “Those who follow the evolution of memory will find that our PMoF Brick is a stunning development for the new in-memory workloads, as well as unprecedented low latency. In businesses and industries where ‘fast’ means an increase in revenue, the PMoF Brick technology can change the economics of enterprise computing.” The company claims its persistent memory dis-aggregation offers far lower costs and simpler management than any other available architecture capable of delivering equivalent performance. Comment What do we have here? Conceive of the collection of PM bricks as a kind of scale-out flash array using flash DIMMs instead of NVMe-connected flash drives. In August last year Plexistor said there are many NVDIMM-N manufacturers: Micron, SK Hynix, AgigaTech, Smart Modular, Viking, Netlist, and several others. It has “tested DDR4 NVDIMM-N cards from most of these vendors and although it is not a plug & play technology yet, it is almost there. We have no doubt that it will get there in less than a year.” Here we are a year later and NVDIMM-Ns are more widely available, for example, from Crucial, and Micron is sampling a 16GB NVDIMM module. Someone has to stuff these DIMMs in servers and set up the system SW environment, and then you have to get the 100GbitE cabling, switches, NICs, PM Bricks and SDM software from Plexistor. It’s early days yet and PlexiStor is still a somewhat stealthy startup. The promise is huge gains in app performance and server efficiency through getting big chunks of data closer - meaning µs-level access speeds - to CPUs using both local and remote NVDIMMs. Combine this with NVMe SSDs and µs-level access to NVMe fabric-connected (or equivalent) arrays, the development of XPoint (Intel and Micron) and ReRAM (WD/SanDisk and Toshiba) and we this whole DRAM-SSD, local/remote, price/performance gap-filling area is a seething cauldron of technology development.

Smart glasses make hands-free 'Pokémon Go' a reality Engadget 8/18/2016 Nicole Lee © Provided by EngadgetPokémon Go has taken the world by storm. It's not uncommon to see dozens of people walking around parks and city streets with their heads buried in their phones, trying to catch cute cartoon monsters. Unfortunately, doing so means you're not keeping your eyes on the road, which has already led to a few accidents. But what if you could somehow play Pokémon Go while also paying attention to the world around you? That's exactly what Recon has attempted to do by porting the popular game over to the Jet, a pair of Android-based smart glasses the company released last year. The setup isn't perfect and it doesn't work completely just yet, but even what I've seen so far provides an exciting glimpse at the next wave of augmented reality. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.06 -0.74 -0.66% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 68.24 -7.75 -10.19% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.62 -6.71 -0.85% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.35 -0.77 -1.26% At Intel's Developer Forum in San Francisco this week, I had a chance to try on a Jet to see the app in action. Since the Jet already has GPS, WiFi and a fully baked operating system, a Recon software developer by the name of Patrick Cho was able to move Pokémon Go over to it as a standalone app. The caveat here is that the Jet doesn't have LTE, so you'll have to figure out how to get WiFi if you're out and about -- an important consideration when playing Pokémon Go. Mine used a hotspot connection to a phone for its internet connection, so we were good there. Cho also had to reorient the Pokémon Go screen from portrait to landscape mode to accommodate the Jet's 428 x 240 resolution display. © Provided by Engadget It took a while to get the app going. Since this is an unofficial port, it isn't optimized for the Jet and feels quite sluggish in action. The app was also prone to stalling, and even crashed on me a few times. But it did work eventually. After a long loading time, I saw the familiar Pokémon Go interface appear in the Jet's bottom-right screen. I immediately saw a map representation of the area surrounding San Francisco's Moscone Center dotted with a slew of Pokéstops imbued with sparkling pink lures. It was a sight that would make any Pokétrainer happy. Unfortunately, I was unable to catch any Pokémon due to the uncooperative app. But the proof of concept is there. Even though there's no touchscreen, I could theoretically throw a Pokéball by swiping the temple on the right. A side button could be remapped to trigger a Pokéstop. And if you were armed with the upcoming Pokémon Go wearable that lets you snag monsters by simply tapping a button, it'd make capturing that elusive Dragonite that much easier. At the very least, I could see myself using the Jet to hatch a Pokémon egg just by walking around. © Recon I particularly appreciated that the game only took up a small corner of my peripheral vision. I could still see and interact with the world as I played the game. This way, I was able to track monsters and still be aware of my surroundings. Of course, the potential downside here is that the Recon Jet's battery life likely isn't long enough to withstand hours of play. But being able to play Pokémon Go without having to stare at your phone still sounds like a pretty great proposition to me. The Jet has so far been used mostly for fitness applications like running and cycling, but Recon recently announced an enterprise partner program that will open it up to other uses too. The idea here is that the AR glasses could be used for work like field service or manufacturing. For example, workers could talk to a remote engineer as they're fixing a problem or look up a user manual on how to fix electrical wiring right as they're doing it. But the real purpose of opening the Jet up is to show how flexible it is as a hardware and development platform. And as I've seen with Pokémon Go, it's a pretty great way to play augmented reality games too. © AOL A Recon spokesperson said that if more time was spent on it and if Niantic joined in to help optimize the app, there's potential for the experience to be much better. Recon isn't the only company to think of this collaboration either. Osterhaut Design Group (ODG) ported an unofficial version of the app over to its R7 headset a month ago, while CapitolaVR created a demo of how Pokémon Go would look through Microsoft's HoloLens headset. Still, the R7 and the HoloLens both sell for upwards of $2,000, while the Jet is available today for $500. Plus, Recon's hardware has already been repurposed to play paintball in the form of the Empire EVS mask, so it doesn't take much imagination to see how it could be adapted to work with mobile AR games too. In an email statement, a Recon spokesperson said: "With further optimization, Pokémon Go on Recon Jet could very well be brought to market in the future." Let's hope it is.

It is a stripped-down computer with a touch-screen, sound and wireless connections. But there is no keyboard. It does many, but not all, the things laptops do. The iPad is easy to use and portable. You can use one to browse the internet, write mail, watch movies and make video calls to friends. It shines when consuming media. Thousands of third-party apps extend its scope. iPad as a computer For many people, the iPad is all the computer they need. But not everyone. Some need more computer. There are those who want a keyboard and those who prefer to use a conventional PC operating system. Some iPad owners add third-party Bluetooth keyboards to use their tablets more like laptops. About four years ago the first devices to bridge the gap between tablets and laptops appeared. Intel and Microsoft came up with computers that had elements of both. Enter the Surface Microsoft pitched it first Surface as a direct competitor to the iPad. It used a reduced version of Windows 8. Surface had built-in Microsoft Office. A kick-stand held the screen in a laptop-like position. There was also a, in theory optional, keyboard that doubles as a screen protector. Almost everyone who bought a Surface also paid for the keyboard. While the Surface looks like a tablet and has tablet-like features, it also looks like a laptop. Most people who own Surfaces use them like laptops as well as tablets. Microsoft created a new device format distinct from the laptop and the tablet: the hybrid PC. Moving from a clamshell Windows laptop to a Surface is less of a wrench than moving to an iPad. All computer Hybrids evolved since the first Surface. Today’s Surface Pro 4 is a direct descendant. There’s nothing you can do on a Windows laptop that you can’t do on a Surface Pro 4. The Surface was Microsoft’s first own-brand PC. Other computer makers have since developed their own hybrid models. There are two distinct types of hybrid. Detatchables are tablets with a keyboard case like the Surface or a docking keyboard. When you connect the keyboard, you have something close to a laptop. You can remove the keyboard and use the computer as a tablet. Convertable hybrids Convertables stay attached to their keyboards. In most designs a hinge lets you fold the keyboard out of the way under the touch-screen. It then acts like a tablet. You can usually fold the hinge to other positions, such as propped up on a table for a presentation. There’s much to like about hybrids. They could be the way of the future. Yet despite growing sales numbers, customers remain unconvinced. Today hybrids of all types only account for between 10 to 15 percent of laptop sales. Three reasons stand out for their relative lack of success to date. Conservative PC owners First, PC owners are conservative. Perhaps not in a bad way. People invested a lot of time and mental energy mastering keyboards, trackpads and mice. They know their way around a conventional PC or laptop and know how to get the productivity they want from it. Touch screens have not captured thier imaginations in the way Microsoft anticipated. The botched Windows 8 introduction made that clear. Little has changed since. Second, the hybrid features and touch screen add to the cost of a computer. You might pay 20 to 25 percent more for a hybrid which, otherwise, has the same specification as a laptop. Many people don’t see any value in that extra price. Satisfied elsewhere Another reason is that a hybrid's tablet functionality is often satisfied by another device. A laptop owner may already have an iPad or another brand of non-Windows tablet. There’s a better chance they’ll have a mobile phone with tablet-like qualities. Computer buyers may yet move to hybrids if hardware companies can convinced them there’s extra value to justify the cost. Help for this has come from an unexpected direction. Apple's positioning and marketing of its two iPad Pro models goes a long way to making the case for hybrid PCs. iPad Pros are still more tablet than PC. But they also have a lot in common with the best detatchable Windows hybrids. Keyboard shortcomings Hybrids are often better than you might expect. Yet even the best still have signification shortcomings. Few detachable hybrids have great keyboards. Typing ranges for just-about-ok to horrible. This doesn’t matter to all users. But for those who write a lot of words, a good keyboard means greater productivity. Most detachable hybrid keyboards flex. Making a keyboard that doesn’t flex often means making it heavier. That is bad news for portability. Clunky convertibles Convertable hybrids tend to be more solid. That makes for a lousy tablet experience. You always carry a hefty keyboard along with the touch-screen tablet part of the device. Most convertibles are too thick and heavy for comfortable one-handed use. This undermines the tablet functionality you paid extra for. All the electronics and battery in a detachable hybrid need to be in the screen part of the device so it works as a tablet. This means it is top heavy when used as a laptop with the keyboard. For this reason most can’t work as laptops in the strict sense of sitting the computer on your lap. Big bets Intel and Microsoft bet the Windows 8 move to touch screens in 2012 would trigger a wave of upgrades. Not only did that not happen, it was the start of a long-term slide in PC sales that continues. Now the pair hope a move to hybrids will pay off with a renewed buying cycle. To do this they must not only convince customers of the value of paying extra for greater versatility. They must also show that buying a new device will make their work easier or their lives more fun. This is something Apple excels at. Cynics talk of Apple's fairy dust or a reality-distortion effect. The truth is Apple knows how to articulate technology's less tangible benefits. Now Apple is selling something that is almost a hybrid, some of the magic may rub off on the Windows hybrids.

With the Oculus and Vive out, the PlayStation VR right around the corner, and Intel announcing their own wireless headset, it seems that everyone wants to get in on the VR game. The last time gaming saw different companies jumping on the new technology bandwagon was around the release of the compact disc. There was the Phillips CD-i, the 3DO, and even the Sega CD attachment for the Mega Drive. Do you think there’s enough room on the market to have multiple headsets? Is the landscape different enough compared to other tech to support it? What sort of strain will this put on VR developers if so? Who do you think is poised to win the VR race? Let us know in the comments below! The Weekend Chat is a new format we're trailing amongst other ideas for NZGamer.com in 2016. We'd love to hear your feedback on this.   » Return to Top   Relevant Articles The Weekend Chat: VR Games Vs. Experiences The Weekend Chat: Will You Be a VR Early Adopter?

That was a good sequence of short words. HAHA I noticed the sequence and thought the same thing .. I Agree on the standardisation so long as it doesn't limit innovation. I think that these things have to have a few iterations before we can have a clear winner. I mean the winner will have to be the one that allows you to wear it full time with no fatigue... and I think that we are a long way from that. When that happens the hardware race will slow down and it will shift more into the software side.   Reply       Posted by ThatUndeadLegacy On Friday 19 Aug 2016 8:32 PM -1 If they don't try closing their platforms to other headset's, yes there will always be room, and more choice is good, since PC is all about choice.   Reply       Posted by gspcdNZ On Saturday 20 Aug 2016 7:50 AM - The problem with VR is that is a static solution with current tech. So motion sickness will always be a factor. AR, (and I don't mean Pokemon Go) has a better chance of working out, simply due to the versatility that it allows. The tech behind Magic Leap is promising the answer to all of this and in theory will just get better with time.   Reply       Posted by CoffeeAddict On Saturday 20 Aug 2016 8:40 AM - It is good, it may encourage more games and software developers to get involved with VR, driving the companies behind the VR sets to continue supporting and updating their hardware and hopefully breed a second better generation of VR. Eventually several will drop at the wayside and we will. be left with some awesome tech or AR will take the helm.   Reply       Posted by ptys On Saturday 20 Aug 2016 12:54 PM 1 Personally I don't want to buy VR until its a refined experience. Going to wait a few years until they work out all the kinks and improve the visuals.   Reply       Posted by gspcdNZ On Sunday 21 Aug 2016 9:19 AM - We develop VR games in my company but you may not have heard of us as we sell these to companies who then sell our work in their name. However, my point is, recently one of our senior developers presented a projected lifespan of VR based on consumer trends over a long list of technology thats come out over the last 60 years. He predicts that VR will go the way of 3D TV by Aug 2017. It all comes down, not to the technology, but to the game developers not making enough games and consumers not having the confidence to buy a rig in mass quantities to guarantee uptake. Its a vicious circle. Will developers invest enough in AAA games, and in large enough quantities for consumers to buy a $1k HMD. I personally don't think PSVR is good enough considering the current incarnation isn't powerful enough to give a good enough experience. Vive is excellent, but there aren't enough great games yet.   Reply       Posted by CoffeeAddict On Sunday 21 Aug 2016 10:02 AM - 21 August 2016, 09:19 AM Reply to gspcdNZ We develop VR games in my company but you may not have heard of us as we sell these to companies who then sell our work in their name.

He predicts that VR will go the way of 3D TV by Aug 2017. It all comes down, not to the technology, but to the game developers not making enough games and consumers not having the confidence to buy a rig in mass quantities to guarantee uptake. Its a vicious circle. Will developers invest enough in AAA games, and in large enough quantities for consumers to buy a $1k HMD. I personally don't think PSVR is good enough considering the current incarnation isn't powerful enough to give a good enough experience. Vive is excellent, but there aren't enough great games yet. Hopefully its got more legs then that but it would be a horrible shame. I quite like my 3d TV but yup I get all my movies from overseas and I my Rental store is stocking less and less 3d movies.   Reply       Posted by cortez72 On Sunday 21 Aug 2016 10:10 AM 1 These kinds of tech always make me worry because I'm monocular. When it looked as though 3D was going to break into gaming as a common practice, I thought I was going to miss out on things. Fortunately this wasn't the case, as 3D never materialised. But VR seems to be an important tech going forward. Just makes me wonder where It's going, and if I'm going with it, or just cheering from the sidelines.   Reply       Posted by Meanvision On Tuesday 23 Aug 2016 1:15 PM - I'm enjoying playing round with the Samsung vr I got free with a phone. Probably wouldn't have brought one tho. It's cool to watch twitch and feel like ur sitting in a movie theatre. But at the moment it more of a gimmic to play round with when I'm bored. It's cool though just not somethng I would spend 200+ $ on at the moment   Reply       By: Keith Milburn Published: Friday 19 Aug 2016 4:00 PM   Ad FeedbackAdvertisement Latest News Phil Spencer: “I’d Love to See Mario on Xbox” Thursday 24 Nov 8:51am Ditto Makes Its Appearance in Pokémon Go Wednesday 23 Nov 2:21pm | 6 Monster Hunter Gets the Movie Treatment Wednesday 23 Nov 1:47pm | 1 Watch Dogs 2’s Seamless Multiplayer Slowly Starts Activating Today Wednesday 23 Nov 8:55am | 2 Telltale’s Third Season of The Walking Dead Gets Release Date Wednesday 23 Nov 8:27am | 5 View More News »     Ad FeedbackAdvertisement     Sign In Need an account?

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro All Black Friday Deals Reviews StormForce Tornado review StormForce Tornado review By Kane Fulton PC & Mac desktops  1440p and Ultra HD gaming for under a grand Shares Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict If you're looking to dive into 1440p and 4K gaming for under a grand, the StormForce Tornado is an attractive choice. Its Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU brings sublime performance, though you might want to add an SSD for extra speed. For 1440p and 4K gaming power Attractive design Plenty of drive bays Good selection of ports Against Hard disk increases wait times Can't turn blue lighting off There's rarely a better time to buy a new pre-built gaming PC than following the launch of a new generation of graphics cards. Pascal is Nvidia's most interesting GPU architecture in some time, if not ever, representing a true generational leap over its predecessor, Maxwell. 14 Nvidia Pascal laptops to up your mobile game The StormForce Tornado comes with the new GTX 1070, which sits in the middle of the Nvidia's triumvirate of Pascal cards alongside the GTX 1060 and GTX 1080. StormForce has twinned the GPU with components that allow for excellent performance at 1080p and beyond. There's even enough grunt for VR and 4K gaming - though you'll have to dial the settings down a notch or two depending on the game for the latter. It can be pre-ordered online for £899 (around $1,180/AUS$1,540) and is set to be released on September 1. Feel the force It's amazing what a change of color can do for a chassis. Decked in white with black external drive bays, this Tornado Gaming Case is much more attractive than the dour all-black version used by ZooStorm, StormForce's sister brand, for previous builds. If a StormTrooper wanted a rig to match their body armor, this might be it. The case's appearance is made more interesting by a mesh design on the front panel, which lights up two fans blowing cool air out of the front with a blue hue. Unfortunately we couldn't find a way to disable the lighting, which is annoying if you want to leave the machine on overnight. The case has a very plastic feel, but it's practical. Removing two screws provides access to the components inside, in addition to three clips that allow the front panel to be taken off and cleaned. Spec sheet Here is the StormForce Tornado configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core-i5 6400 (3.3GHz using Turbo Boost; dual-core, 6MB cache) Graphics: KFA2 GeForce GTX 1070 Standard Graphics Card (8GB GDDR5 RAM) RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 1TB SATA (7,200rpm) Optical drive: Yes Ports: 1 x PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, 2 x USB 3.0 ports (front), 1 x USB 2.0 port (front), 2 x USB 2.0 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 1 x HDMI, 1 x VGA, 1 x DVI-D, 1 x LAN (RJ45), 3 x audio jacks Connectivity: 2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0, headphone jack, microphone port (front) Size: 190mm x 495mm x 432mm (W x D x H) Nvidia's bruising GTX 1070 is the headline act here, so it's unsurprising that StormForce has had to hand-pick other components to keep the cost below £1,000/US$1,315/AUS$1,709. Manufactured on the 14-nanometer process, Intel's Core i5-6400 sits slap bang in the middle of the company's range of mainstream processors, and its maximum clock speed of 3.3GHz is more than sufficient for gaming. There's enough space inside for further expansion. Free slots include one PCI-e x 16 slot, three PCI-e, two standard PCI slots and five internal bays. Additionally, two free 5.25-inch internal bays present the option to install multiple SSDs, while two free external bays mean you can add anything from a Blu-Ray drive to a fan controller. Benchmarks Here's how the StormForce Tornado performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 48,801; Sky Diver: 48,296; Fire Strike: 17,950 Cinebench CPU: 516 points; Graphics: 162 fps Geekbench: 3,555 (single-core); 10,849 (multi-core) PCMark 8 Home: 4,825 points GTA V: (1080p, Ultra): 70 fps; (1080p, Low): 218 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 78 fps; (1080p, Low): 187 fps Other 1070-equipped systems are currently thin on the ground, but the power over Nvidia's previous-generation card is clear when comparing it the Lenovo Ideacentre Y900 with a GTX 970 that we reviewed earlier this year. And, that system costs a full £100 (around $130 or AUS$170) more. Where Lenovo's machine struggled to hit 60 fps on the games we tested on Ultra settings at 1080p, the StormForce Tornado managed it each and every time, surpassing it in titles such as GTA V, The Division and Doom (2016). In The Division, the 1070 managed an average of 61 fps with the resolution set to 1440p; switching over to Doom, it reached an average of 46 fps at 4K. The gap between the two systems is also shown up in PCMark's Fire Strike benchmark. The Tornado almost doubled the Y900's score of 9,629, achieving 17,950 points. Despite its power, StormForce's machine runs quietly under full load with the fans only kicking in during visually intensive scenarios. Nvidia GTX 1080 versus GTX 1070 The Tornado loses marks when it comes to storage - at least in terms of speed. The 1TB SATA drive inside might take you a while to fill, but it renders longer boot and app loading times than what you would get with an SSD. Plus, Steam games take a noticeably longer time to install than we're used to with this drive. Final verdict It's currently difficult to go far wrong with one of Nvidia's Pascal cards right now. However, StormForce has successfully complemented the StormForce Tornado's GTX 1070 inside with an attractive case that's easily accessible and comes with plenty of ports, external drive bays and internal expansion options. It has the muscle to run pretty much any game comfortably at 1080p with each setting maxed out, and you'll get decent performance at 1440p, too. Gaming at 4K resolution will require you to turn the settings down a notch or two if you want to hit those fluid frame rates, which is a fair trade off in our eyes. The StormForce Tornado is only let down by its persistent blue lightning on the front of the case and the lack of an SSD - but at least there's plenty of room inside the case to add your own.

In an interview in Mumbai, Genes spoke about cybersecurity trends in the digital world, and how his team is working to protect users and companies from these threats. Edited excerpts: Can we really compute the cost of cybercrime? We at Trend Micro don’t compute the cost of cybercrime, and all assumptions and statistics about the cost of cybercrime being floated around are simply estimates. We have been in this security business for 27 years and we don’t feel the need to scare people with these figures (Intel Corp.’s security arm McAfee pegs the likely annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime at more than $400 billion.) I could tell you the exact cost of a piece of malware but when it comes to the total cost of cybercrime, all I can say is that cybercriminals make more than drug traders, and the risk of them being caught is much lower than that of a drug trader because cybercrime is international and does not know any borders. How much of a risk does India face, especially from ransomware that tops the cybercrime list in developed countries? The risk in India is much lower than in other countries, at least as of now. But the attacker would not necessarily be from India. He or she could be from Eastern Europe, where many attackers are from. Globally, ransomware appears on the top of the list because it is so visible—cybercriminals want you to see their message on your devices to scare you so that you pay the ransom. On the other hand, other malware like keyloggers, which sit on your computer silently but steal vital information like your PIN numbers, can go undetected for even six months and more. Ransomware is in your face. In terms of malware distribution, ransomware is definitely on the top of the list in the US, and in parts of Europe where keyloggers, remote access Trojans (RATs), etc., make up for the rest of the malware. In Japan, ransomware is typically low. In parts of Asia, it is high. But in India, ransomware is low on the list. In India, cybercriminals typically use keyloggers, RATs that try to siphon off credit card and other financial information from your computer. Why is ransomware low in India? Cybercriminals typically seek return on investment (ROI) from their crimes. Hence, it makes more sense to seek ransom from people in developed countries who have more money. For instance, a recent study revealed that 5% of companies in the US paid ransom but in Canada, the number was very high at 75%, which shows how nice Canadians are (laughs). There are some cybercriminals who even do not know how to use ransomware, so they hire other cybercriminals who sell ransomware-as-a-service, and then try to find out which company or country gives the best ROI. Cybercriminals have now begun targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices... We don’t see large-scale IoT attacks because cybercriminals have not figured out how to make money here. You have so many IoT devices with so many versions of software, so it is unlikely that we will see large-scale IoT attacks in the near future. You do hear a lot about IoT attacks by White Hats (ethical computer hackers) but that’s for fame. For example, at the recent Defcon event in the US, we demonstrated Drone hacking, etc., but it was basically to show that better security measures need to be implemented. This March, at the CeBIT event in Hanover, for instance, we demonstrated sex toy hacking by placing a large, neon-pink vibrator on a desk and bringing it to life by typing out a few lines of code on a laptop. We got a lot of press for it. But if you want to do something bad with this, I can get to the back-end infrastructure and blackmail people by getting hold of the sensitive (and embarrassing) data of the people who use this. Also consider the case of smart TVs. Till now, there were hardly any attempts by cybercriminals to hack these because of the different versions of software. But in China, recently, a smart TV was hacked by a cybercriminal—that is because of the now common Android OS (operating system) build. This implies that malware is used most where standardization prevails, which is not yet the case with IoT devices. If I want to make money as a hacker from IoT devices, I would rather attack the infrastructure that connects these IoT devices to render them useless. For instance, of what use will be an IoT device that cannot connect to the cloud—it will be garbage. You can do a DDoS (distributed denial of service) on the infrastructure or steal all consumer data like health, geolocation, etc. Are cyberattacks on the rise in the financial sector, especially with digital payments picking up around the globe? We saw isolated attacks in those in the US on companies like Target and Home Depot (in 2014), where millions of customer debit and credit cards were put at risk after hackers broke into the companies’ payment systems. That was primarily because the US was using cards that mostly used magnetic stripes for swiping rather than the chip-and-pin system that others were using in Europe. Also consider the banking heist in Bangladesh where the hackers seemed to be well aware of the infrastructure (in February, the hackers used the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, credentials of the Bangladesh central bank employees to send more than three dozen fraudulent money transfer requests to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York asking it to transfer millions of the Bangladesh Bank’s funds to bank accounts in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia). Hackers can physically open the service port of ATM machines, plug in a USB stick and get the ATM to dispense all the money held in the machine. Earlier, most of the work was done on mainframes where every CPU (central processing unit) cycle cost money and where controls were tight because they were UNIX-based systems. Then came the age of PCs (personal computers) and users could install all kinds of software. This is both good and bad. It means that when your in-house development team releases a new application, it needs to train the system before the application can be deployed—at least on critical systems like servers. Android apps appear to be posing a big security risk to users. Android, by design, is not insecure. However, the rights management in Android is not good. It allows you to access third-party apps and users do so when they are desperate to acquire popular free apps. You are relatively safe if you download apps only from Google Play. This is not the case with iOS because Apple has very strict rules for its developers and does not allow users to download apps from any store other that its own Apple Store. China is the biggest mobile phone market store?? but Google does not operate in China. However, the fact is that we get the biggest mobile malware from China. If Google accounts for the malware from China, then users who download Android apps from third parties and not from the Google Play store are definitely at risk. Of late, there have been more attacks on Linux-based systems while earlier it was Windows that was the primary target... That’s because a majority of your cloud-based systems run Linux—like your Web servers. It makes more sense for hackers to attack the infrastructure rather than individual devices. Apple is pretty immune because it created a closed ecosystem. It only runs software from a certified developer community. So is the Windows mobile ecosystem. Of course, they don’t have a market share. Public Wi-Fi hotspots are becoming more popular. How safe are these? Don’t use them if you don’t trust them. They are prone to vulnerabilities like the man-in-the-middle (where a cybercriminal gets between two parties and gains access to private information) attack. You must use a VPN (virtual private network) to access your company data when using a public Wi-Fi, else it can prove dangerous. How is Trend Micro’s partnership with Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization) shaping up? We have been working with Interpol for over two years. (The collaboration was announced in June 2013). We recently helped in the arrest of the head of an international criminal network, suspected of stealing more than $60 million through scams like the business email compromise.

Microsoft is set to build on the success of its Surface devices that it will reportedly come out with a new and improved Surface Pro, Surface Book and sundry Surface devices before the year ends. There have been reports that Microsoft has been testing out three new Surface devices that the company is aiming to roll out this year. News on what these supposed all-in-one (AIO) devices are or what they would look is admittedly thin on the ground but, according to The Verge, Microsoft might be looking to add "traditional PC form factors" to its Surface range. These could mean that Microsoft might be coming out with a reimagined desktop — a Surface desktop, if you will, and one that will integrate the touch capabilities that the Surface Pro or the Surface Book is known for. There are speculations that these AIOs might come in a 21-inch HD, 24-inch, and 27-inch 4K models. Of course, Microsoft would want to keep its edge and come out with updates for the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book. However, consumers shouldn't expect some major changes this time around. It has been said that whatever changes the devices will get will be more along the lines of external beautification, and maybe a little internal overhaul. Reports have pegged that an updated Surface Book 2 might come with Intel's Kaby Lake processor and will support 3D and 4K graphics. But if the company is going with the Kaby Lake, then consumers should expect a delayed release date. The Surface Book's design might be tweaked a bit as well, with the gap on the hinge redesigned so that it will sit flushed against the keyboard. There's no news regarding the Surface Pro 5, but the recent price drop of the Pro 4 has had consumers thinking that Microsoft is clearing out its shelves to make way for a new model.  A new Surface Pro and Surface Book range is expected to be launched in 2017, but Microsoft might be releasing some announcement about this new line later this year.

News Microsoft Surface Devices 2016/2017 Roundup – Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, Surface Book 2, Surface AiO By Pranav Rastogi - August 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Microsoft has strived to improve its much loved hybrid device — the Surface Pro — over the years. And in the end, all the efforts have paid off, as the Surface Pro 4 is undoubtedly one of the most loved hybrid devices on the market today. The Surface Pro 4 offers not just a better experience as a laptop replacement, but also carries a lot of power for demanding tasks. We have seen Microsoft trying to translate the success of the Surface Pro 4 into something for the Surface Book — and although it isn’t as popular a device, it certainly makes one wonder if Microsoft will further expand the Surface lineup. Surface Desktop or Surface All in One A number of reports have suggested that Microsoft wants to introduce a new line of All-in-One systems soon. Although there is no confirmation what these AIOs will look like, it is certain that Microsoft wants to take a bite out of Apple’s share in the pertinent markets. It has been suggested that these AIOs will be unveiled in three sizes. The smallest model will have a full HD (1080p)21-inchh screen. The other available screen sizes will be 24-inch and 17-inch — and both will have 4K support. These AIOs are expected to implement the use of touch input on devices with larger screens, like a desktop. Do note that these devices have not been yet confirmed by Microsoft, and might very well be pulled from the market at the eleventh hour. However, if these devices do debut, they will be ideal for living room environment — which is why they will be a direct competition to Apple Macs. For more details on the Surface desktop, click here. Surface Phone Granted, Windows Phone never really took off the way Microsoft wanted it to, but Microsoft isn’t holding itself back from the smartphone market. Rumors suggest that Microsoft will debut a new Surface Phone soon. The phone is expected to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM. The phone will obviously be running Windows 10. A less likely version of the phone that is also rumored has an Intel Atom processor, and 5GB of RAM. Some leaked images suggest that the phone could come with a 5.5in AMOLED display, and a body crafted out of aluminum and magnesium. Furthermore, the Surface Phone is also rumored to work with Surface Pen and allow seamless integration with Microsoft Continuum. Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5 Now coming to the two most anticipated devices. Do note that no radical design improvements are expected in the next iteration of the Surface Pro and the Surface Book. Under the hood improvements in graphics and performance, as well as a new Type Cover are more likely. A number of reports suggest that the Surface Book 2 will come with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors — and this is why the device might be delayed to the beginning of 2017. Further, the Surface Book 2 is also likely to make minor improvements in the hinge design: Microsoft is planning to retain the functionality but change the physical appearance to something that doesn’t leave a gaping whole when the laptop is closed. To read more about Surface Book 2, go to: Will Surface Book 2 be a MacBook Killer?  The Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book are expected to come with Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. Since that update is likely to happen in 2017, these two devices might be debuted alongside the update. Microsoft has also started offering price discounts on Surface Pro 4, which is also a reminder of the impending release of the Surface Pro 5. For more details on the Surface Pro 5 visit here.

Ivan Menchavez22 August, 2016 Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Microsoft is said to be planning on releasing several devices this year or in 2017 including the highly anticipated Microsoft Surface Pro 5. According to reports, the upcoming hybrid laptop is Microsoft's answer to the new MacBook Pro 2016 from Apple, which is rumored to come out in fall. Although Microsoft has yet to provide concrete details with regard to the development and release of the highly anticipated device, several information have emerged online that would get tech fans excited. (Microsoft)The latest iteration, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could launch in 2017 alongside Surface Book 2 and two other Surface devices. According to a report by to PC Advisor UK, the successor of Microsoft Surface Pro 4 will come out in 2017; however, the publication said that there are indications suggesting that a different version may come out this year. Apparently, a photo has been spotted inside Microsoft's building 88 that appear to show a Surface device with "coming soon" and "2016" texts. Another poster was spotted showing three devices with "2017" on them. There are reports suggesting that Microsoft might announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in October 2016 but will schedule the release by next year. However, this has yet to be confirmed by the company. A spring 2017 release for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 makes a lot of sense since the new Windows 10 update will not be available until next year. Meanwhile, Country Caller reported that Microsoft is also waiting for the seventh generation core processor from Intel, the Kaby Lake. There have been speculations saying that the company will build the Surface Pro 5 around the new powerful chipset. In the meantime, the Country Caller shared that Microsoft is still waiting for the availability of Intel Corp.'s Kaby Lake processor, another reason why it is impossible to see the Surface Pro 5 this year. There are reports suggesting that Intel will start the roll out of the processor by the end of 2016. As of the moment, fans are expecting the company to provide solid information with regard to the development of Surface Pro 5.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Here Is A Working IPhone 7 In Deep Blue Color Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:27am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 20 2016, 11:35am CDT, in Rumors | Apple   tech.infeng   New pictures of the rumored Deep Blue iPhone 7 Plus have emerged online via tech.infeng, which show every beautiful angle of the phone. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock If the pictures are authentic then all this becomes more exciting as they depict a fully working unit but it is possible that the final model we see at the release might be slightly different. These pictures are our first actual look at what the iPhone will look like. The images coincide with everything we have learned and seen of the new iPhone 7 over the months. There is the camera hump present as well has dual lens and repositioned antenna lines.                     This Deep Blue iPhone will become the first iPhone to be offered by Apple in any color other than Space Grey, Gold, Silver and Rose Gold. If one was to over think this color choice than we could look at Samsung and its apparent bias towards this color and use in most of its high end product lines. With the launch of the iPhone so near we are now getting to hear more about what the device has to offer internally. Recently a comparison of the logic board for iPhone 6S and 7 was leaked which pointed out all things similar and different between the two. The comparison pointed out that Apple will no longer be using Qualcomm to power its baseband chips but will instead be switching to Intel. It is a possibility that Apple ends up offering both the baseband chips but we won’t be able to comment on this until people actually starting using the new iPhone. We will surely be getting a whole host of new leaks before the final release of the iPhone 7 which is scheduled to take place on September 7th, so near!

Perhaps swarm-based robotics has something to offer after all. Watch as the ReefScouts take off like a group of dolphins and then sink to the bottom like a synchronized swimming display.  If you think swarm robots are just small insect-like machines, or at best a flying squadron of drones, then meet the ReefScouts. These small, yellow, torpedo-like robots can do real work sampling and measuring underwater environments.      Watch the video and notice the way they are casually dropped from a container into the sea. Notice they way they school like a shoal of fish and get back to base on their own. This is not just a mark of how much robotics has moved on, but how low cost it is becoming. The components you need to make robots is dropping the more we make. Small computing devices like the Pi Zero are so cheap that they are effectively disposable and if you need the power devices like the new Intel Joule can provide, the price may be higher but it is still affordable.   ReefScouts look as though they were built to do real work. OceanLAB built the swarm as a demonstration of how intelligent control systems can make deployment of data gathering devices easier. The whole point of the swarm is that the user, or controller, doesn't have to navigate at the level of individual robots, but just tell the swarm where to go and sample and let them sort out the details on their own.     As OceanLAB explains it: "We seek to maximize swarm agility while protecting the operator from complexity. Our swarms can be guided as a large, fluid mass. For oceanographers, the group delivers a map of real-time distributed data and can be actively guided to target areas of maximum interest." If you want to know what theoretical approach is being used, it is basically non-equilibrium thermodynamics with each robot regarded as a particle in a fluid.  "Numerical modeling experiments demonstrate how groups can be influenced to display different phase-like behaviors by adjusting global parameters. Dissipation (drag) is the most effective parameter for regulating group coordination."   More Information http://oceanlab.com/ Related Articles Modern Fireworks - 100 Drones Break The Record Festo's Ants And Butterflies  1000 Kilobots Make Patterns  The Swarm Game        Kilobots Work Together        A Swarm Of Humanoid Robots!          To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.      //No Comment - TDD, C++ Lambdas & Agile Under Scrutiny 09/11/2016 • Test-Driven Development • An empirical study on the impact of C++ lambdas and programmer experience • Software Quality - Traditional vs. Agile: an Empirical Investigation + Full Story Model Of ENIAC Accumulator Wins Tony Sale Award 20/11/2016 A simplified model of the ENIAC accumulator built and exhibited by the Heinz-Nixdorf Museum in Padderborn, Germany, has won this year's Tony Sale award for computer conservation. + Full Story More News Microsoft C++/WinRT HTML 5.1 Is Here //No Comment - TV Control, Geolocation & Webmention APIs Take VisionMobile's Gamified Developer Survey Intel Wants To Replace Fireworks By Drones TJBot - Using Raspberry Pi With Watson The Weekly Top 10: Learning about eCommerce Udacity Blitz From a Different Perspective Exploding RoboSimian - What 96 Batteries Can Do Facebook's Yann LeCun On Everything AI Suspense Over Visual Studio For Mac - Update Neural Networks Have A Universal Flaw \\No Comment - Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity & The Statistical Mechanics of Human Weight Change       Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus   Last Updated ( Saturday, 20 August 2016 )     Follow @Iprogrammerinfo     RSS feed of news items only Copyright © 2016 i-programmer.info.

According to VCCapital, India’s homegrown e-commerce company Snapdeal approached competitors Flipkart and Amazon India about the possibility to merge. If Snapdeal merged with either one of those two players, it would be a really big consolidation in the booming, Indian e-commerce market. However, Flipkart and Amazon India both denied the VCCapital report, calling it “baseless” and “false”. The report alleged Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl met with top executives of Tiger Global Management, the U.S.-based investment giant and the largest investor in Flipkart, presumably to discuss the issue. Tiger Global has invested an estimated $1 billion U.S. in Flipkart; Naspers, the South African media giant, is another major Flipkart investor. Snapdeal raised $627 million in 2014, followed by a second round of funding of $500 million last year. In total, Snapdeal has raised around $1.65 billion from about two dozen investors. These include SoftBank and SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, EBay Inc., Indian media company Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. (publisher of the Times of India), and venture capital investors such as Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Iron Pillar, Kalaari Capital and Ratan Tata. Snapdeal, Flipkart and other Indian e-commerce firms are feeling pressure on their margins, after the Indian government blocked deep discounting, which had begun to hurt offline retailers. The two Indian entities are also facing stiff competition from Amazon, that has been spending heavily on growing the market in India, focusing in part on Junglee.com, its e-commerce / classifieds hybrid. (See our report here).

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Karen Turner August 19 Follow kthalassa The percentage of women working in IT has always been relatively low, but it didn't used to be as low as it is now. The percentage of women in information technology peaked at 31 percent in 1990, then declined by about 6 percent over the past decade, even as the percentage of women in other occupations has steadily risen. That's just one notable metric from a new Census Bureau report released this week that provides a bird's-eye view of the changing field of computer work since the 1970s. The report also shows that most IT workers tend to be young, male, are often foreign-born, and that the field of IT has grown considerably in both size and complexity as technology becomes increasingly important. The report found that the number of IT jobs has grown from 450,000 in 1970 to 4.6 million jobs in 2014, which accounts for 2.9 percent of the labor force. Additionally, IT work has become increasingly diverse, growing from three categories in the 1970s to 12 by 2010, reflecting new professions within the field. "In these early years, computers were large, expensive mainframes mostly used by governments, research laboratories, and manufacturing firms," the report states, citing the mid-1970s as the beginning of the personal computer boom. " … As the market expanded, so did the demand for IT workers." IT jobs identified in the 1970s include computer programmers, systems analysts and computer specialists. As the field grew in size in the following decades, jobs such as database administrators, information security analysts and Web developers were born as new job categories. The report also reflects not only new jobs but also old ones that have been classified more accurately. Wages in the IT field have grown in the past four decades for both men and women. In the '70s, men were paid a median of $74,180, which jumped up to $80,895 in 2014. The field represents a rare net rise in earnings — wages for men across all professions have gone down over the same timeline, according to the census report. For women, wages have grown both in IT and across all other professions, although median wages for women are overall lower than for men. In 1970, the median wage for women working IT jobs was $57,315, and in 2014 it jumped to $70,385. Clearly, the wage gap has closed slightly over the years, but still persists. A breakdown of wage and gender on a specific job level reveals that the wage gap tends to be bigger where there are more women employed. For example, for the job of database administrator, which has the most equal breakdown of genders within the IT field, the gender wage gap was the highest. The wage gap along with the drop in female workers in IT, which dropped from 31 to 25 percent since the ’90s, shows that issues surrounding lack of women in tech persist. The report also projects the field will grow by 18 percent by 2022, although the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational handbook has the industry's growth at 12 percent by 2024. While the growth of this industry of jobs is irrefutable, some experts such as Ronil Hira, research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, aren't impressed by these numbers in context. "Given the large amount of IT spending by all companies and the outsized role that IT plays in consumers' lives, employment in the sector should be much higher," he said, citing recent layoffs and the trend of offshoring IT jobs to less expensive countries as examples showing that the industry might be more unstable than the report suggests. Cisco announced 5,500 layoffs last week on the heels of Intel's 12,000 layoffs and Dell's 10,000 worker cuts, adding to a total of 63,000 IT job cuts this year alone. Hira said many of these jobs are going abroad to places such as India. "The next generation of IT jobs will be created in those countries rather than the U.S.," he said. Hira said he is also concerned about the IT field's tendency to hire young, foreign-born workers. The census report shows that more than half of all IT workers are between the ages of 25 and 44 and that 24 percent are foreign-born. Hira said that a number of these employees are guest workers employed under H1-B or L-1 visas. These workers tend to be young, male and, despite being highly skilled, are employed in the United States under uncertain conditions and at considerably lower pay. While the census report does not dive into the number of IT workers who have guest visas, EPI's own analysis has estimated that some two-thirds of all new hires each year are working under guest worker visas. "This drives down wages and harms working conditions for Americans and immigrants alike because H-1B workers are paid less," Hira said. "It reduces incentives to make IT more inclusive demographically, and reduces incentives to invest in training and retraining for incumbent workers."

PHOTO: AFP Officials hope to shrug off city’s low-cost, low-skill reputation as money flows in mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, August 20, 2016 Updated: 1:55 PM, August 20, 2016 CHENGDU — China’s western hinterland has long been seen as a low-cost manufacturing hub and a source of migrant workers for coastal cities. But the city of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in the west, is seeking to change that perception, casting itself as a high-tech investment zone and a pivot point to Eurasia. In an effort to change its image, the sprawling city of 14 million has been assiduously cultivating high-tech start-ups, as well as expanding its infrastructure. At the same time the Chinese government — whose economic focus has long been on Beijing and coastal cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — has begun to lavish investment and infrastructure effort on its under-developed west, with cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi’an finding themselves the main beneficiaries. In tribute to the ancient Silk Road, China’s President Xi Jinping recently named the strategy One Belt, One Road. Aimed at reviving ancient routes to central Asia, Russia and Europe, the policy is channelling investment to the regions they pass through. As a result, Chengdu finds itself in the right place at the right time. Known in China mainly as the home of panda bears and spicy hotpot dishes, and famed for a relaxed, mahjong playing lifestyle and thousands of tea houses, the city is now being given a chance to join the elite club of so-called top-tier cities of China and be the economic engine of the western region. “Thirty years ago, we were following in the footsteps of the coastal cities but now with One Belt, One Road it’s the other way around — they’re following us,” says Mr Liang Qizou, the deputy head of Chengdu municipal finance department. However, some economists are cautious about how quickly the west can catch up with the coastal cities. “Western China grew a lot faster than the east during the commodity and housing boom, but that outperformance has tailed off quite noticeably in the last couple of years,” says Mr Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics, a Beijing research firm. It will take a few years to see whether Mr Liang’s boast becomes reality, but progress has been impressive — about 300 Fortune 500 companies already have some form of operation in Chengdu, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in the city. Two shopping complexes, the IFS and the Taikoo Li malls, have recently opened — both built by Hong Kong developers — and gleaming skyscrapers line Tianfu Avenue, the city’s main arterial road. Thanks to the One Belt, One Road policy, Chengdu already has a rail link with Lodz in Poland, as well as industrial parks for French, German and South Korean businesses. “If it weren’t for One Belt, One Road, these industrial parks wouldn’t be located in Chengdu,” says Mr Liang. The city had been applying to build a second airport for years and finally received the go-ahead after Obor was announced in 2013. Chengdu will be China’s third city to have a second airport. Once completed, the authorities expect the airport to handle 90 million passengers a year. Construction of the new airport follows a building boom over the past decade for which Chengdu has become famous. The city’s then-Communist Party secretary, Li Chuncheng, acquired the nickname “Demolition Li” for his approach to redeveloping the old city. Then in 2012, a political reshuffle saw much of the leadership of the city sacked or thrown in prison in a harsh crackdown on corruption. In December that year, Li was sacked and then prosecuted for bribery, and is now serving a 13-year prison sentence. The pace of decision making on new projects has been slow following the political upheaval and anti-corruption campaign, says one foreign businessman in Chengdu. Analysts say privately that members of the former city leadership were too closely tied to ousted chief of security, Zhou Yongkang, and the fallen party secretary of nearby Chongqing, Bo Xilai, both of whom were purged by Mr Xi. Chengdu seems to have shrugged off the bad news associated with the corruption scandals. Mr Liang says that last year’s growth of 7.9 per cent was above the national average. But despite the strong economic performance, rents are cheap. Although it is the seventh-largest city in China by population, the city ranks 36th in property prices, according to a list produced by Sohu. That is partly because Chengdu, like most Chinese cities, has built too many buildings, with some of the excess being converted into industrial parks — the city has 21. Low wages and a highly educated workforce have already attracted high-tech manufacturing. Chengdu’s government says that Apple contractor Foxconn makes half of the world’s iPads in Chengdu — although Foxconn refuses to comment on this claim. The government also says that half of Intel’s laptop computer chips are made there as well. Intel would only say that “some good percentages” of its chips are made in Chengdu. While the availability of a lower-cost workforce has proved attractive, some managers say the hardest thing about being in Chengdu is recruitment — at 2.8 per cent last year, the unemployment rate is one of China’s lowest for a major city. Mr Benjamin Wang, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Chengdu and a coffee merchant, says that retaining trained staff is hard in his coffeeshop businesses. “They stay one year and then move on,” he says, adding that the low unemployment and the tight labour market “is great for the government but bad for us”. Mr Wang has seen competition for workers increase. Since 2011, he says, the number of coffeeshops in Chengdu has ballooned from 35 to 700. Many residents say that government aid to the Sichuan region following the devastating 2008 earthquake was the determining factor behind the city’s growth over the past decade. Nowadays, Chengdu’s prospects are also being lifted by the government’s efforts to attract companies. Mr Liang estimates that 70 per cent of investment in the city was attributable to the development of those 21 special industrial parks in Chengdu where infrastructure and financing are subsidised by the government. The most famous such zone is theTianfu Software Park which offers 100 million yuan (S$20.2 million) in annual subsidies to early stage start-ups, according to its management. The project is the centrepiece of an effort by Chengdu’s local government to challenge the notion that high-tech innovation can only happen in established zones in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. It is also part of the government’s aim to change the image of the city as a source of cheap labour and low-cost manufacturing. “They want a certain type of investment … they don’t want to be known for low-wage, low-skilled manufacturing,” says Mr Wang.

The Associated Press Leave a comment 3 reads In this May 4, 2016, file photo, Duncan Wallace drives a golf cart from his house to his golf club as a group of landscape workers take a break in Vista, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — THE ISSUE: The rich keep getting richer while more Americans are getting left behind financially. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 percent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 percent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 percent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 percent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that it’s thinning out the ranks of the middle class.  ___ WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system “rigged” against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. ___ WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality “the defining challenge of our time.” And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 percent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for “superstars,” according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren’t working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a “hollowed out” labor market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle. Social factors have amplified the trend as well. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than other families and less likely to ascend the income ladder. Finally, men and women with college degrees and high pay are more likely to marry each other and amplify income gaps. ___ This story is part of AP’s “Why It Matters” series, which will examine three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election between now and Election Day.
