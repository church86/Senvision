By: Rohit Arora Updated: Monday, January 2, 2017, 19:50 [IST] Microsoft is gearing up for an all new Surface Pro machine in the year 2017. The US tech giant is said to be working on a new version of its Surface Pro laptop, which is set to arrive in the first quarter of 2017, most probably by April 2017. As per reports, the Surface Pro 5 will be manufactured by Pegatron Electronics and the 2-in-1 laptop will come with a 4K Ultra HD display and a magnetic charging stylus, possibly an improved version of Surface Pen. The current generation Microsoft Surface Pro 4 uses the latest sixth-generation "Skylake" Intel processors, and the Surface Pro 5 is expected to come with Intel's Kaby Lake Core i7 processor paired with 512 SSD for internal storage.

As noted, the Surface Pro 4 supports Windows Hello face authentication using the camera as well as a fingerprint sensor on a new Type Cover for the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft is expected to equip the Surface Pro 5 with the same or improved security features. We can also expect Microsoft to improve the Surface Pen, which is designed exclusively for the Surface series of devices and is used for effortless training and drawing. This Pen comes with three buttons and a tip. SEE ALSO: Renders of the Upcoming Microsoft Surface Phone Leak Online Besides, a lot have been said about the Surface phone and 2017 might be the year Microsoft launches the smartphone. Some recent leaks suggest that the phone will be laden by a plastic body with three capacitive hardware keys on the front for back, home, and Bing search. On the back, there is Microsoft logo and camera module, and it looks far more similar to the previous Lumia devices Saturn ring. On the specification side, we might see a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor running the show in support with 6GB of RAM.

Introduction and design 2. Value, performance and verdict Best in Class Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict The Dell XPS 13 is like a tortoise surrounded by hares, taking its time in adopting fresh, new tech to deliver an excellent, modern experience that doesn’t leave legacy users behind. Plus, it’s just bloody gorgeous. For Faster than ever Same long-lasting battery SD card slot Great range of prices Against Still poor webcam position No Windows Hello Dell has done it all over again. The latest and greatest Dell XPS 13 recently arrived, and it’s frankly already been our favorite laptop for the last two years. This time coming equipped with the latest, 7th generation ( Kaby Lake) Intel processors behind that same eye-dropping display and punchy keyboard we’ve come to enjoy typing on – now all within an optional rose gold frame – the new XPS 13 has wowed us all over again. And, much of that isn’t thanks to crazy innovations or fresh additions, but a few key refinements that help the XPS 13 stand out amongst a sea of laptops that are perhaps trying to change a bit too quickly. The XPS 13 is a tortoise surrounded by hares … only it’s got a rocket strapped to its back.  Price and availability Available now through its website and several retailers, Dell begins the bidding for the standard XPS 13 at $799 (£999, AU$1,899) to start. In the US, that gets you a Kaby Lake, dual-core Intel Core i3 processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage behind an FHD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels), non-touch InfinityEdge display. (The UK and Australian versions come starting with an Intel Core i5.) If you want the touchscreen at QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) resolution – and the two screen features only come as a pair – you’ll need to cough up at least $1,299 (£1,249, AU$2,499). That also nets you a dual-core Intel Core i5 chip, but sadly doesn’t up the storage or RAM capacity. Of course, you can choose to upgrade both of those components for extra cash.  Weight-wise, the XPS 13 is a totable 2.7 pounds (1.2kg). It's something you could toss in a bag between classes or take with you on your next business trip and barely notice it's there. (That said, it's probably for the best if you cover your new investment with a case just to be safe.) The screen itself is Dell's new InfinityEdge Display. Images go nearly to the edge of the screen with only a thin strip of plastic separating the glass from the edge. The distance separating the two, for the record, is a measly 5.2mm. Spec Sheet Here is the Dell XPS 13 configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 3.5GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB LPDDR3 (1,866MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) InfinityEdge touch display Storage: 256GB PCIe SSD Ports: 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 3.0 w/PowerShare, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), SD card reader, headset jack Connectivity: Killer 1535 802.11ac (2.4 & 5GHz); Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 720p widescreen HD webcam with dual array digital microphones Weight: 2.9 pounds (1.29kg) Size: 11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33 – 0.6 inches (W x D x H) (304 x 200 x 9 – 15mm) Design Frankly, there isn’t a ton to be said of the XPS 13’s design this time around, as very little, if anything, has changed. You still have the 13.3-inch display as sharp as QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800 pixels) with optional touch controls squeezed inside an 11-inch-wide frame.  And, you still have the gorgeous, machined aluminum lid and base that beset a comfy, carbon fiber keyboard deck coated in soft-touch paint. Only this time, the lid and base come in rose gold – the salmon shade that’s all the rage in tech products these days – as well as the traditional silver option. The machine somehow measures even thinner than the previous generation, though only by a hair: 0.33 inches (9mm) at its thinnest point to 0.6 inches (15mm) at its thickest. For those keeping score, the previous model came in at two hundredths of an inch thicker at the nose. Dell has also reduced the weight of its leading laptop, but by such a small degree it would be impossible to notice: from 2.93 pounds (1.32kg) to now just 2.9 pounds (1.29kg) even for the touchscreen model. Short of a major breakthrough in the materials used to construct the XPS 13, we’re likely looking at the thinnest and lightest Ultrabook from Dell for a while. (Please, prove us wrong.) All told, we’re still smitten by the XPS 13 design, and frankly we’re happy it hasn’t changed much, because it doesn’t have to. One small request: if Dell could at least center that bottom bezel-oriented webcam like it has on the new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, that would be clutch.  More ‘pro’ than the MacBook Pro? During our time with the new XPS 13, we realized an important point: this laptop can match and even surpass the new, entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro part-for-part. For 100 bucks less than Apple’s latest laptop, the XPS 13 offers a sharper screen, a stronger processor and the same amount of RAM and storage. Oh, and this guy has a full-size SD card slot.  The MacBook Pro? You’ll get one more Thunderbolt 3 port – one of which needs to be used for charging – and little else for its starting price. On paper, it seems like the XPS 13 will give you a better time editing photos and video than its archnemesis. Well played, Dell. Nick Pino has also contributed to this review.

It's Complicated By Doug Mohney January 13, 2017 Building the connections for the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging, since applications, services, and devices of all different shapes, sizes, and requirements have to seamlessly communicate.  In an ideal world, we would have a WebRTC-like interface standard accessible through HTML, but it's not going to be that simple, says the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). “The approach we've taken is focusing on data level interoperability,” said David McCall, a Senior Strategic Planner at Intel. “It's difficult for developers to build things since they have to focus on [lower level] protocols and build upward.” OCF is made up of over 300 companies, with members spanning from the usual tech suspects such as CableLabs, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm to industrial concerns including Electrolux and GE along with Lowe's (yes, the home improvement store) and a cast of other interested parties.  The organization is focusing on building a common open set of standards with a grammar, a language of sorts, and specific “words” useful for devices.  IotTivity is the open source framework built and available for use today, with a standardized resource interaction model, standardized data modules, worlds, and language, enabling developers to write apps based on the OCF framework and make them interoperable with other services and devices in a particular ecosystem. Devices, services, and apps using the OCF framework and specifications should be able to intercommunicate, but there will be specialized words (characteristics) and uses within specific areas. An IoT healthcare device under the OCF framework should work fine within and to another OCF-based healthcare device, service, or app, while an IoT device for the Smart Home will have a different applicable set of worlds.  There are currently specific OCF projects for Automotive, Healthcare, and Smart Home, with a separate working group dedicated to security to insure best practices from day one. Since there are already a large number of IoT devices in the world, the OCF framework also included the concept of bridges since the beginning of the effort. In the telco world, a bridge would be similar to a session border controller (SBC), with translation in this case being between existing/legacy proprietary IoT protocols and OCF-speak. OCF is handling both, defining the specification and certifying compliance to it, along with providing and supporting the IotTivity open source code for developers.   There are eight OCF certification labs up and running around the world and there are a number of devices and manufacturers already working with the specification today. Demonstrations I saw at CES 2017 included interoperability between OCF wearable healthcare devices, “legacy” healthcare devices and OCF services, a kitchen and living room “smart home” demonstration, and an interop between an OCF automobile and a smart home.  The smart home demonstrations were the most memorable for the shiny new devices working in combination, including an LG refrigerator loaded with a large Microsoft Windows 10 see-through touchscreen connected to various devices and air conditioner/purifiers.  One can have pre-loaded scripts of IoT settings on the fridge for cooking that cranks up the local air purifier, to prevent odors from filling the household, another for party mode that lowers the AC, adjusts the lighting, and turns on music, and so on. The connected home/auto demo showed how different settings could be customized for the driver and the home, changing the tone and volume of music in the house once the driver has left the garage – something that may be appealing to parents and children with different music tastes, if nothing else. Given that OCF has been in operation for less than three years, it is impressive to see the progress made in developing code and getting working interoperable solutions between devices and services.   I'm hoping for more marketing of OCF IoT interoperability awareness at the buyer/consumer level so I can buy the “Best of breed” solutions of what I (think) I need without having to worry about compatibility or being locked into a specific solution.  OCF will also mean bigger opportunities for the reseller/VAR world, since businesses will want to do the same when it comes to applying IoT to their own needs.

Historically, moving to larger wafers was a critical way that foundries and fabs cut prices and improved yields. Historically, companies like Intel led the charge on wafer size, but there’s always been a very long tail. Currently, some 23 firms have 300mm fabs in production, while 58 companies still operate 200mm fabs. 450mm wafers were meant to further extend the cost savings of 300mm wafers, but high costs and uncertain rollouts appear to have doomed the endeavor. Several years ago, Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and IBM collectively launched the Global 450 Consortium (G450C) in partnership with The Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly). This collaboration was a $4.8 billion-dollar endeavor (over five years) to develop tools, work with suppliers on 450mm ecosystem development, and to create appropriate infrastructure for the future deployment of 450mm wafers. This was no small task — larger wafers means different tools, and tool costs are a substantial reason why process nodes are becoming more expensive over time. EUV tools and lithography equipment, for example, are significantly more expensive than traditional 193nm ArF lasers. According to a recent report in the Times-Union, two of the five companies involved in the G450C are pulling out after the end of the five-year program. Graph and data by ICInsights. A report from IC Insights published in October 2016 sheds some additional light on this situation. While 300mm wafers are more popular than 200mm wafers in terms of total production capacity, they are also limited to specific areas of the market. DRAM, NAND flash, image sensors, power management devices, CPUs, GPUs, and other high volume technologies are typically built on 300mm wafers. 200mm wafers are used for smaller runs, where lower total volumes are expected. We’ve discussed before how TSMC makes a significant percentage of its income using nodes that haven’t been cutting-edge in a decade or more. Many of these older nodes are paired with older equipment to keep them cost-effective and minimize the purchase of new hardware. Intel’s estimated wafer costs, when it still expected 450mm wafers to be A Thing. There are several intrinsic advantages to using larger wafers. If the foundry can keep its wafers-per-hour production rate on 450mm wafers close to its 300mm wafer production rate, it can produce vastly more chips per hour. This helps reduce costs, provided that the semiconductor economy is healthy and the foundry utilization rate is high. Being able to build more chips per hour can also allow older lines to be shut down, saving on factory costs. Larger wafers mean that large-die processors don’t cost as much area around the edges of the wafer and reduce overall waste as a result. The graph above shows Intel’s estimated wafer costs over time, and illustrates why the company was anxious to move to 450mm wafers over the long term. If the shift had been successful, Intel’s long-term roadmap for Atom processors might have taken a different path, since 450mm wafers would have allowed the company to reduce its per-die Atom cost and likely compete more effectively against TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries (at least, until those firms rolled their own 450mm wafers). With multiple companies pulling out of G450C and no clear roadmap for the technology, it seems safe to conclude that 450mm wafers are pretty much dead. Pilot programs have ended, firms are still focused on ramping up 300mm wafers at various foundries, and no semiconductor firm we’re aware of is still championing 450mm wafer research or deployment. High costs and machine replacements appear to have nuked any argument for superior cost savings in the long term or improving wafer utilization.

As part of a series of tweets, Trump also blamed Democrat and Republican politicians, claiming they were conspiring against him. BREAKING: CNN reports Intel report to Obama and Trump said that Russia has compromising info on Trump … https://t.co/eWCC8xt85P — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) January 10, 2017 Using information allegedly obtained from a former U.K. intelligence agent named Christopher Steele, the Associated Press reports United States intelligence agencies last week provided information to President Obama, President-elect Trump, and senior leaders in the House and the Senate – the so-called Gang of Eight – indicating that Russian operatives might have compromising financial and personal information about Trump. Trump Putin portrait in Moscow. Donald Trump Twitter rants deny supposed Russian connections. [Image by Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP Images] The 35-page report also apparently contained information suggesting that the Donald Trump campaign team interacted with Russian officials throughout the 2016 election. The information in the report was originally compiled by Steele partly at the request of Donald Trump’s competitors for the Republican nomination. In the early morning Donald Trump Twitter messages, he indicated that the leak of this document to the media was part of a conspiratorial effort on the part of his political opponents in both parties to produce false but damaging information about him and his incoming administration. “Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans…” In addition to politicians and intelligence agencies, Trump has also targeted CNN in his Twitter feed attacks, and during his most recent news conference, he described CNN as “fake news.” This despite the fact that Fox News – hardly a liberal-leaning news organization – has affirmed that CNN’s methods and reporting on this story are solid and journalistically sound. These recent Donald Trump Twitter posts also leaned on Russian assurances that they had no such information about him, once again indicating the greater trust Donald Trump seems to have in Russia and Vladimir Putin than he does in United States intelligence agencies. “FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists.” In yet another Donald Trump Twitter message, Trump went the time-honored route of attacking the messenger, in this case the messenger being – as reported by the Associated Press – former U.K. MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele. “It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued…” But the various United States intelligence agencies involved in examining this material to verify its accuracy and authenticity have already concluded that Steele has proven to be a highly reliable intelligence source in the past, making his assertions this time more believable.

[Image by Leon Neal/Getty Images] In addition, prior investigations by various news organizations have suggested that Donald Trump may owe considerable sums of money to Russian oligarchs and banks, making him extremely vulnerable to pressure from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. This most recent report also apparently includes rather salacious suggestions that Donald Trump, while in Moscow in 2013 and staying at the Ritz Carlton, engaged the services of two prostitutes. In the leaked report, United States intelligence agencies report indications that Russian intelligence might have video of this encounter, which supposedly included a sexual practice known as “golden showers.” The sad thing is, I would believe Trump participated in #GoldenShowers way before I would believe he is president. #GoldenShowerGate — Paul Chatlain (@PaulChatlain) January 11, 2017 Given the extremely scandalous nature of such financial, personal, and sexual information on the incoming president, it’s hardly surprising that the Donald Trump Twitter account would be plastered with his denunciations and denials. However, it’s also true that Donald Trump has frequently denied doing things – such as mocking disabled reporters or making sexually offensive comments about women – despite video or audio evidence that he did. MStreep speech re-opened subject of Trump mocking disabled reporter. TV Trump-bots, tell us not to believe our eyes, ears & brains…again. — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 10, 2017 It’s an open question whether Donald Trump as president will allow these investigations to proceed. Will we see Donald Trump Twitter account attacks against his own administration’s intelligence agencies?

Security researchers began openly discussing the vulnerability this week, which allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms and run malicious code via the USB debugging interface. This specifically affects Intel’s U-series of Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, which are lower powered processors typically used in OEM systems. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to go as far as rewriting your system BIOS but it does require USB 3.0 to work, along with a supported debugging interface, according to researchers at Positive Technologies. Before Skylake came around, debugging was done through a special port on the motherboard that was not easily accessible. However, since then Intel has moved to a Direct Connect Interface, which allows access to the JTAG debugging interface through a USB 3.0 port, though only one port on any machine will be capable of accessing JTAG. This isn’t something that would necessarily affect every day users, but it could be a big deal for servers or enterprise users. This exploit can be used regardless of the operating system installed on the machine, so it can affect Windows, Mac and Linux. However, the issue has since been brought up with Intel, so they are aware of it and will hopefully look into fixing it. KitGuru Says: Obviously for an attacker to pull this exploit off, they would either need to be physically at the machine or they would need to trick someone into plugging a dodgy USB in to the right port by themselves. Either way though, it is a security hole that could use some tightening, particularly now that it is public knowledge.

MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium Overclocked to 5.2GHz During the discussion, MSI stated they have tested several hundred different Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake processors and haven’t had any issues with any of them.  There are a couple caveats that you have to be aware of to reach the 5.2GHz.  First, a good high quality (closed loop) water cooler is required, it needs to be a minimum of a 240mm model (dual rad).  Next, the memory should be a good high quality enthusiast brand; while overclocking the CPU won’t be impacted by the memory much, it is always recommended to get the best you can afford.  Of course, MSI did reinforce that they are not responsible for damages caused by the GAME BOOST feature as with any end user performed overclocking. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium The demonstration at CES 2017 did indeed show the system up and running within the UEFI, but not within Windows (which is the real test).  The test system included the MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium motherboard, G.Skill F4-4000 DDR4 memory, and a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Ultimate.  We asked them to reset the UEFI back to defaults, and once that was done. They demonstrated the single click to get to 5.2GHz, simply by setting the Game Boost to 11.  After a quick reboot, the system took a moment to re-enter the UEFI, but once it did, it was showing 5.2GHz once again. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium BIOS A couple interesting things within the UEFI that we noticed, the CPU voltage was automatically configured to run at 1.507V.  The next thing, the CPU temperature was reading 48C.  This seems to be higher than most would want, especially considering that it is in an open air test bed, with a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Ultimate running with the fans at high speed.  So while 5.2GHz might not be an issue while idle, once we start running tests it might become an issue with heat. MSI Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium In our current testing of the Gigabyte Aorus Z270X Gaming-9 and ASUS Prime Z270-A motherboards and the Intel Core i7-7700K, we have been able to obtain an unstable 5.1GHz, and a stable 5.0GHz overclock.  MSI sent Legit Reviews their Z270 XPower Gaming Titanium motherboards, so we can verify the overclocking ourselves.

The Kaby Lake processors bring a number of changes to Intel’s traditional CPU lineup, including low-TDP models of most chips and Pentium processors with Hyper-Threading. 7th-gen Intel desktop processors are available in South Africa, although certain chips have not released locally yet. Intel has branded several processor models with a “T” suffix in order to show that the chip is a special, low-TDP model – which has been under-clocked in order to use less power. The majority of these low-TDP models are currently not available from South African retailers, including Rebel Tech, Wootware, and Evetech. Below is a pricing overview of the Intel 7th-gen desktop processors available from these stores.

If you’ve ever used an embedded Linux development device with wireless networking, you’ve likely benefited from the work of Marcel Holtmann, the maintainer of the BlueZ Bluetooth daemon since 2004, who spoke at an Embedded Linux Conference Europe panel in October. In 2007 Holtmann joined Intel’s Open Source Technology Center (OTC), where he created ConnMan (Internet connectivity), oFono (cellular telephony), and PACrunner (proxy handling). Over the last year, Holtmann and other OTC developers have been developing a replacement for the wpa_supplicant WiFi daemon called IWD (Internet Wireless Daemon). In the process, they have streamlined the entire Linux communications stack. “We decided to create a wireless daemon that actually works on IoT devices,” said Holtmann in the presentation called “New Wireless Daemon for Linux.” Marcell Holtmann at ELCE with chart showing the current Linux communications stack (left) and new, streamlined stack with IWD wireless daemon replacing wpa-supplicant (right) (click image to enlarge) The IWD is now mostly complete, featuring a smaller footprint and more streamlined workflow than wpa_supplicant while adding support for the latest wireless technologies. The daemon was also developed with the help of the OTC’s Denis Kenzior, Andrew Zaborowski, Tim Kourt, Rahul Rahul, and Mat Martineau. IWD aims to solve problems in wpa_supplicant including lack of persistence and limited feedback. “Wpa-supplicant doesn’t remember anything,” Holtmann told the ELCE audience in Berlin. “By comparison, like BlueZ, oFono, and neard [NFC], IWD is stateful, so whenever you repair the device, it remembers and restarts when you reboot. Wpa_supplicant does have a function that lets you redo the configuration network, but it’s so hackish and problematic that nobody uses it. Everyone stores this information at a higher layer, which complicates things and creates an imbalance.” Wpa_supplicant manages to be overly comprehensive while also failing to reveal key information. The daemon is difficult to use because it adds support for “just about every OS or wireless extension,” including many things that are never actually used, says Holtmann. “The abstraction system actually gets in your way.” Despite its capacity to “abstract everything,” wpa_supplicant does not expose much information. “You have to know a lot about WiFi and how things like parsing are done,” said Holtmann. “I just want to connect, not read a 2,000-page document to find out I have to use a pushbutton method to gain my credentials.” Other limitations with wpa-supplicant include its dependence on blocking operations, in which the system must ask each peripheral for confirmation of operations before it moves on to ask other systems. This leads to “a system just waiting for something to happen,” says Holtmann. Wpa-supplicant has other complications like “exposing itself to user space in at least four different ways,” said Holtmann. These include the antiquated D-Bus v1 and still problematic D-Bus v2, which “swallows states,” as well as a binder interface and CTL, “which is great for users, but for a daemon is horrible.” To make up for the limitations of D-Bus v2, the overall wireless stack long ago spawned an abstraction layer above D-Bus and below ConnMan called gSupplicant. While this helped offload work from ConnMan, the latter was still overloaded.   Reducing Complexity With the addition of IWD, Holtmann and his team removed GSupplicant entirely. It also replaced other user space interfaces with a single updated D-Bus layer. In addition, the new stack removed inoctl and lib Netlink (libnl), which Holtmann called “a blocking design that can’t track family changes.” Libnl was replaced with Generic Netlink, which does offer family discovery. Holtmann also eliminated wireless extensions (wext) because “they’re broken and hopefully they will someday be removed from the kernel,” he said. The new wireless stack retains cfg80211 and nl80211 (Netlink), although the latter has been upgraded and pushed upstream. The OTC team developed a new Embedded Linux Library (ELL) that features tables, queues, and ring buffers to reduce the complexity of IWD while still providing basic building blocks for netlink and D-Bus. “We extended ELL with cryptographic support libraries instead of using OpenSSL, which is huge, and is not an easy interface,” said Holtmann. “In a lot of cases you need only 10 percent of OpenSSL, so we went a different route and used random numbers using the getandom() system call, with no problems with boot up time.” Finally, for ciphers and hashes Holtmann used AF_ALG, which he defined as “an encrypt interface for symmetric ciphers into the kernel.” With ELL and AF_ALG in place, the developers could eliminate OpenSSL, as well as gnuTLS and InternalTLS. The team also added tracing support for nl80211 with the help of a tool called iwmon. “Now we can start scanning and selecting networks,” said Holtmann. “We can do active and passing scanning and SSDID grouping, and support open networks, We can connect to open access points and W2 and WPA/RSN protected access points. We have simple roaming, experimental D-Bus APIs, and EAPol, and ELL logging for D-Bus and Generic Netlink.” Holtmann went on to discuss new support for enterprise WiFi technologies like X.509 certificates and TLS. Recent kernels have improved X.509 support, so the OTC team is exploiting the kernel’s keyrings to better manage certificates. Future tasks include finishing up enterprise WiFi and developing a debug API. The developers are also looking at possible integrations with Passpoint 2.0, P2P, Miracast, and Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN). Once IWD is complete, Holtmann and the OTC will address 802.15.4, bringing improvements to 802.15.4 compliant wireless protocols like ZigBee, 6LowPAN, and Thread. If you can make it to Portland, Oregon on Feb. 21-23 for the North American edition of the Embedded Linux Conference, Holtmann will revise his wireless daemon talk with updates. He will also give a presentation on Bluetooth 5, as well as a talk about using Zephyr on the BBC micro:bit.

More like this Here's how the MacBook Pro stacks up against the PC Surface Book i7 vs. MacBook Pro: Fight! Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro: Is it worth buying? Video Reality check: Apple Watch vs. Pebble Time (vs. no smartwatch at all) Apple is used to criticism from PC partisans, but with its first major redesign to the MacBook Pro line in years, it found itself unexpectedly taking fire from its own fan base. The new laptop was underpowered, Mac users complained, lacked ports that people actually use, had low-to-zero serviceability, and that “improved” butterfly keyboard still wasn’t that great.  The point that seems to uniformly burn pro users is the maximum amount of RAM: just 16GB of LPDD3/2133. The reason for the limit? Apple said it saves power, which lets them make the MacBook Pro thinner. I won’t pass judgment on that decision (though I think PC makers are also too concerned with thin sometimes), but I will say there’s a pretty easy way Apple could satisfy its unhappy performance-minded customers: Bring back the MacBook Pro 17. Yes, Apple once sold a giant 17-inch MacBook Pro, which it discontinued in 2012. Five years on, it's even easier to build a powerful laptop than it was back then. Bringing back an unapologetically big, beefy MacBook Pro 17 could be just what Apple needs to make its laptops great again. Here's what we'd put in it. AMD Could a Ryzen make its way into a future MacBook Pro? Quad-core or more The Macbook Pro 17 should have a high-end Intel or AMD-Ryzen-based quad-core at a minimum. People say CPU performance doesn’t matter, but it does. The crowd that would actually buy and use a portable workstation needs to get work done. This means a quad-core or more. While it wouldn’t be a first—PCs have sporadically been available with six-core CPUs for years—Apple could cause much jealousy if it scored access to a low-power version of a next-gen Intel or AMD CPU with more than four cores. Big, fat GPU I think people looking at the MacBook Pro 15 should pony up for the higher-end Radeon Pro 460, because the entry-level GPU is a bit underwhelming on pure horsepower. Yes, it’s great on power consumption, but more performance on a primarily performance-minded laptop is generally better. For the MacBook Pro 17, Apple should look into a higher-wattage GPU that gets it into the GTX 1070 class. That doesn’t mean Nvidia-only, as AMD is expected to launch its next-gen Vega GPUs this year. The point is to go for the gusto with a hotter, more powerful chip. A fat GPU isn’t just about gaming: GPUs today handle video encoding and a spate of compute-based tasks. Giving up some thinness or battery life to accommodate a faster GPU would pay real dividends. Crucial Using standard DDR4 SO-DIMM modules would cost battery life, but at least allow a MacBook Pro to hit 32GB or more. Load up on RAM Apple’s decision to use LPDDR3 rather than DDR4 was driven by the company’s decision to make it thin. The company says it did it to save power, because LPDDR3 uses less than plain old DDR4. Apple could have used DDR4 like everyone else, however, and just put in a larger battery to accommodate it. An added bonus: more RAM. The largest LPDDR3 RAM modules that work with Skylake CPUs (such as in the MacBook Pro) accommodate just 8GB of RAM, while those for DDR4 can take up to 16GB. Had Apple gone with DDR4, its two RAM modules could have given users a nice 32GB of memory. To be fair to Apple, no previous MacBook Pro has hit the 32GB mark either, but clearly the backlash says customers want more. The cost, on paper anyway, doesn’t look that bad: While LPDDR3 has a sizable advantage in standby power consumption, active use shouldn’t cost more than 5 percent to 10 percent, according to Intel. Either way, it’s clear that Apple’s customers want a laptop that offers at least 32GB. Storage is great, but... One area you can’t kick Apple for is storage performance. The company makes its own SSD controllers and they cook, with OS X-based storage benchmarks posting 3GBps reads and 2GBps write range. If we were to be downers, though, we’d say NVMe PCIe M.2 drives offer similar performance, and they work on an industry standard. The one improvement we’d ask from Apple is to follow industry standards on the MacBook Pro 17. Oh, and because the chassis will be larger—offer the option of two M.2 drives, and maybe even a 2.5-inch drive for bulk magnetic storage. IDG iFixit says you can fix the trackpad, but the rest of the MacBook Pro 15 is a lost cause. Repairability is green computing I’m not sure, but I think iFixit gave the new MacBook Pro 15 a negative-1 in serviceability. OK, I’m kidding, but iFixit did give it a 1, which might as well be a negative-1. Not only is the RAM soldered to the motherboard (which has been the norm for superthin Ultrabooks for some time), but Apple has now chosen to weld the SSD’s chips to the motherboard too. While some don’t think that’s a big deal, consider that the GPU, CPU, RAM, and NAND are all mounted to the same board. If any of those items failed, you’d be looking at replacing all four. In warranty, that’s not a big deal. Out of warranty, you might as well throw it away. The most green policy Apple could adopt is to offer upgrade- and repair-friendly designs rather than pursue thin, disposable designs. That means following industry standards as much as possible. Adam Miller More ports would be great on any future MacBook Pro. Many ports in a storm One weakness of the MacBook Pro 15 is clearly the number of ports, and further, the lack of port diversity. The laptop gives you four USB Type C / Thunderbolt 3. Period. With the AC adapter in one port and an external monitor in another, you have two ports left. Plug in your Logitech adapter for a mouse and keyboard, and you now have one port left. Plug in a gigabit ethernet adapter, and you’re done. You now have to constantly pull devices to plug in a card reader or USB thumb drive. And you’ll need dongles for sure. USB Type C is great, but it ain’t that great yet. Apple may be showing more of that courage by dropping USB Type A, but it’s an overreach. So please, Apple: On the MacBook Pro 17, give everyone a couple more ports, and the diversity of port selection that the MacBook Pro line has always been known for. A big battery In its pursuit of thin, Apple actually reduced the size of the battery in the MacBook Pro 15 from the previous model’s by almost 25 percent. The good news—and something Apple doesn’t really get enough credit for—is the company managed to keep battery life rather good for a quad-core, 15-inch laptop, with 9 hours of video run time. But here’s the thing: A bigger battery means more run time. Would a quarter of a pound really have killed MacBook Pro 15 users? Who knows—but on the MacBook Pro 17, it’s about performance and battery life, so go all the way and drop in the maximum 99.5 watt-hour gas tank. IDG Apple’s Butterfly key design isn’t as good as the design of previous keyboards. A real Apple keyboard The last feature Apple should put in the MacBook Pro 17 is a real Apple keyboard. You know, the kind of keyboard that let every MacBook user say with an air of superiority why Macs are so much better than PCs. With the newest MacBook Pros, PC laptop users don’t hear that bragging anymore. Instead you hear, “well, you get used to it,” or “I know it’s hard to believe, but I actually like it. No seriously, I do.” That’s quite a turnaround. For the MacBook Pro 17 to make Mac laptops great again, the company needs to return to the real Apple keyboard. This story, "Apple, bring back the MacBook Pro 17 and make your laptops great again" was originally published by PCWorld.

Name: Subject: Message: What is Android Things? – Gary explains Features Newsby Gary Sims3 days ago 6 474 17 Recently Google announced its new Internet of Things initiative based on Android, the aptly named Android Things. It was back in May 2015 that Google announced Project Brillo as its IoT operating system, but having looked at the feedback it received from developers about Brillo, Google decided to ditch it and create Android Things. By adding Android to the name, Google is emphasizing that developers are able to use familiar Android SDKs, APIs and services including the Google Cloud Platform. Android Things is only a preview at the moment and there is much to be done, however enough of the final operating system is working so that developers can start creating Android Things based projects. Hardware Android Things supports three boards: the Intel Edison, the NXP Pico i.MX6UL and the Raspberry Pi 3. Support is coming for the Intel Joule and the NXP Argon i.MX6UL. The first thing you will notice is that these boards use a mixture of Intel and ARM based CPUs and that both 32-bits and 64-bits are supported. The minimum amount of RAM is 512MB and all the boards support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Android uses the Linux kernel at its core and Linux is a full multi-tasking operating system with virtual memory support. This means that Android Things needs a processor that supports virtual memory, in other words a processor with a full MMU. For ARM processors this means something from the Cortex-A range and not a microcontroller from the Cortex-M range. The reason I mention this is that there are lots of IoT products that use microcontrollers and therefore have less memory, less flash storage, use less power, and use less complex operating systems. By opting to use Android and Linux then Google aiming at a particular segment of the IoT market and is automatically excluding itself from the other segments. Whether this is the right decision remains to be seen. The most popular board of the currently supported three is the Raspberry Pi. It is cheap, well known and easy to acquire. I also happen to have one (or maybe more) floating around here so I took Android Things for a spin using my Pi! Booting The first step is to download the correct Android Things image for your board. For the Pi that means downloading the .img file (which is wrapped up in a .zip file) and writing it to a microSD card. Then you insert the card into the Pi, connect up the monitor (via HDMI) and then connect the power. Android Things takes about 90 seconds to boot on the Pi 3. First you are shown some boot information (as text) in a similar vain to Linux booting, this is replaced after a few seconds with an Android Things loading screen which shows three pulsating dots (to show that it is working). Finally this is replaced by an Android Thing splash screen, which tells you about the status of the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections and little else. A minute and a half is quite a long time for an IoT device to boot, I can imagine lots of scenarios were such a long boot time could lead people to think something is broken, especially it the product doesn’t include a display of any kind. Having said that, the level of complexity (and hopefully the abilities) of products based on Android Things will be similar to that of mobile devices rather than “simpler” microcontroller based systems. Connecting The next step is to connect to the Pi. This is done over Ethernet. Plug in an Ethernet cable that is connected to the same network as your development PC and then use adb to connect. You can download adb as a standalone kit directly from Google. The Raspberry Pi will multicast the hostname “Android.local” so you can connect to the board using the following command: adb connect Android.local
 Once the connection is established the splash screen will change to reflect the new status. It is also possible to connect via Wi-Fi, but to do so you first need to connect via Ethernet. To connect your board to Wi-Fi use the following command: adb shell am startservice \
 -n com.google.wifisetup/.WifiSetupService \
 -a WifiSetupService.Connect \
 -e ssid <Network_SSID> \
 -e passphrase <Network_Passcode> If you are connecting to an open Wi-Fi connection then you don’t need to use the passphrase argument. You can check the connection by looking at the splash screen or using adb shell ping 8.8.8.8 to verify that the board can connect to the Internet. The good news is that the board remembers the Wi-Fi connection details, which means that after the initial set up you can connect via Wi-Fi without using Ethernet. Developing Before you begin building Android Things you need to update your SDK tools to version 24 or higher, as well as update your SDK with Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher. Likewise, Android Things apps must target Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher. At the moment the Android Things APIs aren’t part of the Android SDK, so you need to declare the Things Support Library dependency in your app by adding the dependency artifact to your app-level build.gradle file: dependencies {
 ...
 provided 'com.google.android.things:androidthings:0.1-devpreview'
} Also you need to add the Things shared library entry to your app’s manifest file: <application ...>
<uses-library android:name="com.google.android.things"/>
...
</application>
 Every Android Things app must declare an activity in its manifest as the main entry point after the device boots. The intent filter must contain the following attributes: Action: ACTION_MAIN Category: CATEGORY_DEFAULT Category: IOT_LAUNCHER For ease of development, this same activity should include a CATEGORY_LAUNCHER intent filter so Android Studio can launch it as the default activity when deploying or debugging. Google has some example code on its Create an Android Things Project page. There are two main types of Android Things app, ones without a display and those with displays. For the latter, you can build apps with the same UI toolkit available to traditional Android applications. However there are some differences, for example Android Things does not include the system status bar or navigation buttons, which means the app has full control over the visual user experience. Where Android Things differs from normal Android is that it can control peripherals and read sensors. Anything from temperature sensors through LCD displays and on to servo motors can be used by Android Things. This interaction is done via the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) ports which you find on boards like the Raspberry Pi. The system service used by Android Things to manage peripheral connections is the PeripheralManagerService. This service handles not only simple GPIO but also interfaces like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which is a common method used by servo motors; The Inter-Integrated Circuit (IIC or I2C) bus, often used by sensors, actuators, accelerometers, thermometers, LCD displays, and much more; the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), which is used by things like external non-volatile memory and graphical displays; and good old fashion serial ports (UARTs), for use by complex peripherals such as GPS modules and XBee radios. App development should be familiar to anyone with Android Studio experience. The code tree is the same as for a normal Android app using familiar files like AndroidManifest.xml along with Java code and XML files for the layout. Gradle is used to build the projects and Android Studio is able to send the resulting app over the network to your Android Things board. Since Android Things is a specialized version of Android, only one app runs, the app that has been flashed over to the board. Whenever you boot the board it will start running that app. This is an essential difference between a general mobile device (like a smartphone) and an “embedded” Internet of Things device. Google has posted a bunch of Android Things sample projects on GitHub including a simple GPIO example, a sample UI, a smart doorbell (that uses a camera along with Firebase) and a weather station. Problems The key feature of Android Things is that it is based on the normal Android that we know and love. The idea is that Android developers can branch out into IoT and build some interesting products, maybe in conjunction with a mobile app. Or maybe there are existing Android apps that would work well as standalone devices. As a minimum there is lots of code out there that can be reused and repurposed for Android Things. However this compatibility with Android comes at a cost. The system requirements for Android Things devices are quite high when compared to microcontroller based devices and operating systems like mbed OS. Does my refrigerator really need a quad-core processor and 512MB of RAM? Of course there are advantages to having such processing power at your finger tips, maybe more computing will occur on the devices (like facial recognition, voice processing and parts of the AI infrastructure). However if these devices end up integrating with the cloud, which they will as they are Internet of Things devices, then there isn’t such a strong case for extra computing power at the point of user interface. I know that this is a preview, but the issue of device life-cycle doesn’t seem to have been addressed by Google at all. At the moment to configure the Wi-Fi you need to use adb, hopefully Google has something special in mind, maybe even a reference app for handling device deployment or even a generic app which can “talk” to any Android Things device. Which leads to the issue of authentication, something that is non-existent in Android Things at the moment. But as I said, this is a developer preview… One thing that I found annoying about my time testing Android Things is that the adb connection kept dropping. I would connect, work with Android Studio, upload the app etc. But then after a few minutes the connection would drop, which meant I was constantly using the command line to re-connect to the board. This obviously isn’t a workable solution in the long term and I hope Google sorts it out. Wrap-up The technology behind Android Things is well established and well known by developers across the world. Together with access to popular hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi, Android Things could be a winning formula. However the high level of system requirements and the current lack of deployment infrastructure could mean that other platforms offer more for less. Ultimately time will be the judge, if IoT device makers opt for Android Things then it will be a huge growth market for Google, not in terms of the actual devices, but in terms of the cloud services that these devices use.

Many of them are award-winners in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) – BTYSTE included – with some achieving this all on their own, and some finding strength and success in numbers. Read on to find out who will lead Ireland’s scientific future, and prepare to feel immensely proud of this genius generation. Emily Duffy 2017 marks Emily Duffy’s fifth year at BTYSTE. She spoke at BT’s Dream It, Do It event yesterday, along with Williams F1 IT director Graeme Hackland and Rio Ferdinand. All set for the BT Young Scientist @BTYSTE come find my stand at the exhibition on Thursday and Friday #DuffilyBag pic.twitter.com/wAg74Z3naL — Emily Duffy (@duffily) January 10, 2017 Duffy’s Young Scientist projects often make the headlines. First was her sleeping bag for those sleeping rough in 2015, which was fireproof and waterproof, with reflective panels for increased visibility. The Duffily Bag was produced on a larger scale by a Dublin charity and has gained interest globally. Last year, she developed a nappy that could show when babies were sick. Caolann Brady The first ever female winner of SciFest, 2016 was quite the year for Kildare native Caolann Brady. Her project, Hum Your Way to Better Health, focused on the natural treatment of asthma through humming and breathing techniques, as opposed to using inhalers and nebulisers. With 175 subjects, Brady tested their breathing before and after humming at various pitches. On average, a 45-minute respiratory improvement came from this practice, compared with using an inhaler. Caolann Brady was named the overall winner of SciFest 2016. Image: Keith Arkins Photography A student of St Wolstan’s Community School in Celbridge, Brady is representing Ireland at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair later this year. Maria Louise Fufezan and Diana Bura Maria Louise Fufezan (17) and Diana Bura (16) won last year’s Young Scientist competition thanks to their project looking at animal feed and roundworm proliferation. The duo followed that prize up with third place at the European leg of the competition last September. Their study was entitled: An Investigation into the Effects of Enzymes Used in Animal Feed Additives on the Lifespan of Caenorhabditis Elegans, which is a nematode (roundworm) found in temperate soil environments. Remarkably, this was the first time Fufezan and Bura entered the exhibition. Lauren Murphy Separate to the BTYSTE but also last year, Loreto Secondary School Balbriggan student Lauren Murphy represented Ireland at Intel’s International Science and Engineering Fair with her incredibly simple, yet effective, smart rehabilitation device, which she invented to aid multiple sclerosis sufferers. Noticing the ‘clenched fist’ problem that her father – and many MS sufferers – regularly had, she created a tangible aid to encourage greater hand dexterity.

Image: DCU At a hackathon in Dublin City University (DCU) last year, Murphy met with engineers as well as the company Nuwave Ventures, who were impressed with her concept, ultimately lending their expertise to bring the project to fruition. Renuka Chintapalli Renuka Chintapalli won an award for her individual project at BTYSTE 2016. She was also the only Irish regional finalist at the Google Science Fair last year. With her sights set on becoming a doctor, Chintapalli’s research analyses the anti-cancer abilities of garlic, and was accepted for publication in the International Journal of Nutrition and Cancer. She has also identified a new protein suspect in the biology of oesophageal cancer. Chintapalli spoke about her BTYSTE project to an audience of 160 international health professionals at last year’s Future Health Summit. This is Renuka Chintapalli – https://t.co/fKAj6NqNnH – she got published at age 15! #medinnov pic.twitter.com/eu978WEFpk — Keith Grimes (@keithgrimes) September 17, 2016 John Ryan, Teofil Camarasu and Eoin Davey Ireland’s brightest young programmers descended on DCU in February of last year for the All-Ireland Programming Olympiad, where their skills were pushed to the limit to solve a myriad of highly complex coding challenges. In the end, the trio of John Ryan, Teofil Camarasu and Eoin Davey carried off the top senior prize, each receiving full marks for the event. Pictured at the All-Ireland Programming Olympiad are (from left): Gary Conway, AIPO manager, John Ryan, Stephen Ashmore of Fidelity Investments, Teofil Camarasu, Eoin Davey and DCU’s Prof Rory O’Connor. Image: Nick Bradshaw In the year that has passed, Ryan is now working as a data scientist at Intel, Camarasu is furthering his studies at the University of Oxford and Davey is studying at Maynooth University. Shauna Flynn DCU PhD research student Shauna Flynn has set herself no easy task: ensuring that Moore’s Law continues to hold true. The winner of the inaugural Inspirefest ResearchFest competition, Flynn is working to find a faster, cheaper way of making transistors even smaller, as Moore’s Law comes up against the wall of what’s possible. With funding from the Irish Research Council and Intel, the Dublin native is using block copolymers to form patterns on the surface of silicon wafers. These patterns can then be used to make transistors, with the potential to more than triple the number of transistors on chips. Luke Byrne Wicklow student Luke Byrne, who attends Coláiste Chraobh Abhann in Kilcoole, has developed a new product to solve a problem that vexes many: tangled headphones. Headphone Helpers use a silicone band to stop them from becoming tangled. For his clever design, Byrne was named the winner of last year’s Student Enterprise Awards, run by the Local Enterprise Offices. Wicklow teenager Luke Byrne. Image: Student Enterprise Awards/Twitter The innovative silicone band is worn around the neck and features loops that thread the headphones to prevent them getting tangled or falling away while running. Matthew Hewston, Fergus Munday and Luke Sheridan Matthew Hewston, Fergus Munday and Luke Sheridan are the co-creators and co-founders of Squeazy, an educational toy based around the Cartesian Diver experiment, which demonstrates Archimedes’ principle of buoyance. The simple toy was created to make learning about science more fun. Squeazy was initially developed by the young classmates during transition year. The trio took that initial idea and ran with it, and have since won the National Student Enterprise Awards and pitched on the RTÉ show Junior Dragons’ Den. Matthew Hewston pictured with Squeazy. Image: DCU Hewston is another DCU student, currently studying marketing, innovation and technology. And, well, we think he already has innovation locked down. Annie and Kate Madden Co Meath sisters Annie and Kate Madden are the creators of FenuHealth, a business that makes horse feed more appetising for racehorses, using fenugreek herbs and spices. It all began when Kate did a Young Scientist project in 2014 on whether Mars bars help horses to go faster. They followed this up a year later with their fenugreek product, which they described as a supplement designed to get horses to eat their food. The pair, who attend Loreto College, St Stephen’s Green, have since sold thousands of units of their product to horse trainers in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. Lee Campbell, John Harding, Pauric Dempsey and David Hatton The foursome of Lee Campbell, John Harding, Pauric Dempsey and David Hatton formed the 2014 Irish F1 in Schools winning team, Autolaunch Racing. The team were awarded for their work designing, testing and building a miniature Formula One car with Campbell, one of the founding members of Ireland’s Digital Youth Council, serving as team manager and technical director. Autolaunch Racing went on to compete in the F1 in Schools international final in Abu Dhabi.

Ciara Judge, Émer Hickey and Sophie Healy-Thow It has been four years since the Cork trio of Ciara Judge, Émer Hickey and Sophie Healy-Thow were named the 2013 winners of BTYSTE for their project A statistical investigation of the effects of Diazotroph bacteria on plant germination. In the year that followed, they were named Time magazine’s most influential teenagers in the world, and each has gone on to forge their own successes. So honoured to be named here in Canada by @jcinews as one of the most outstanding young people in the world! 🎉❤️😁 pic.twitter.com/BSYtcxvm7b — Ciara Judge (@CiaraFudgyJudgy) November 4, 2016 Judge is currently co-founder of Germinaid, which she set up with Hickey in 2015, at the same time as being CEO of another start-up, PurchaseMate. Healy-Thow is a strong advocate for charitable causes and groups, seen during a recent visit to Rwanda with Action Aid Rwanda. Edel Browne Athenry native Edel Browne is a biotechnology student and entrepreneur in residence at NUI Galway. From left: JCI Ireland director of community, Keira Keogh; Edel Browne; and JCI Galway president, Keith Killilea. Image: JCI Galway Ireland/Twitter She is also the co-founder of Free Feet, a start-up developing technology to help people with Parkinson’s disease to overcome ‘gait freeze’ by shining a light in front of the foot. This improves mobility by giving the patient a target to focus on, and it could help millions of Parkinson’s sufferers worldwide. Now 19, Browne started the project when she was just 15 years old and won the Best Individual Project award at BTYSTE 2013. Elle Loughran As a young teen, Elle Loughran was selected to participate in Outbox Incubator, a first-of-its-kind incubator for girls in STEM. Since then, she has only gotten busier. In between speaking at the World Youth Organisation’s International Women’s Day Summit in London and Inspirefest 2016, Loughran completed her Leaving Cert and is currently studying at TCD. I love how the country goes crazy for @BTYSTE. I remember going to England and most hadn't heard of their national science fair. — Elle Loughran (@frizzyroselle) January 11, 2017 She’s also working on several research projects along with an under-wraps project with AAT and Master Makers, according to her blog. She will taking the stage once again at the Dublin Tech Summit in February.

He stood in front of the mirror with a toothbrush gripped firmly in his right hand and vigorously lathered toothpaste over his million dollar smile. But thanks to the full range of the camera angles, the would-be ordinary appeared epic with up close and personal snapshots of the entire process, including Brady's cowlick on the back, upper-left area of his head. Dental hygiene: Then, the four-time Super Bowl winner brushed his teeth like a champion Step one: He stood in front of the mirror with a toothbrush gripped firmly in his right hand Step two: Then he vigorously lathered the toothpaste over his million dollar smile Seeing it all: Brady showed up close and personal snapshots of the entire process, including his cowlick on the back, upper-left area of his head Next, the three-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player made his famous 'Brady Cakes' pancakes like a champion.  He flipped one perfectly in the pan, but even pros make mistakes now and then.  The flapjack got away from him when it came time to move it to the stack he was collecting on a plate on the counter, crashing to the floor next to his pooch. Breakfast! Next, the three-time Super Bowl Most Valuable Player made his already famous "Brady Cakes" pancakes like a champion Uh oh! He flipped one perfectly in the pan, but even pros make mistakes now and then Slippery sucker! The flapjack got away from him when it came time to move it to the stack he was collecting on a plate on the counter Brady moved swiftly to grab the breakfast item off the floor before his dog could snatch it up, invoked the five-second rule and stuffed the delicassie in his mouth. And Intel's 360 technology showed every crumb drop from every angle as he devoured the breakfast food.  The commercial ends with Brady about to do one more thing like a champion, but the camera cuts as he closes the door to his bathroom, leaving just a little bit of mystery in tact for the professional footballer. Five second rule! Brady moved swiftly to grab the breakfast item off the floor before his dog could snatch it up, invoked the five-second rule and stuffed the pastry in his mouth What a view! Intel's 360 technology showed every crumb drop from every angle as he devoured the breakfast food The reason Brady got to do everything from his everyday life in such grand style was to showcase what Intel has partnered with Fox Sports to bring to the big game. With the help of 38 cameras installed in Houston's NRG stadium, broadcasters will be able to pause any moment from live play of Super Bowl LI and view it in 3D from all angles, according to Intel. Viewers at home will also be able to use the same technology to 'be the player.'  What's the point again? The reason Brady got to do everything from his every day life in such grand style was to showcase what Intel has partnered with Fox Sports to bring to the big game They'll get to experience the game from the point of view of the athletes on the field, by choosing their own moment of live game play to freeze and see from the player's perspective. This will be the first time a product that is advertised during the Super Bowl will also be a part of the production of the game. Super Bowl LI will be played on February 5 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 8:08PM A few days ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family for desktop computers, known as Kaby Lake. With the launch came new chips from Intel as well as new motherboards using the company's new Z200-series motherboard chipsets (the top of the line ones targeted at high-end personal computers are known as Z270). The main new feature that came with the Z270 chipset is support for the company's new Optane memory technology. Optane is the marketing name for the company's upcoming 3D XPoint memory technology, a new type of memory that's supposed to be much faster than the NAND flash used to build today's solid state storage drives. 3D XPoint memory chips, which Intel markets as Optane. Image source: Intel.  Intel's marketing pitch for Optane is simple: a small Optane-based solid state drive can be installed into a system alongside a traditional hard disk drive to deliver "[solid state drive]-like speed and [hard disk drive] capacity." Image source: Intel.  This all sounds like a cool idea, and in theory, could boost Intel's PC dollar content share while also helping the hard disk drive makers. Let's look at how it could do so, if the technology works as advertised (a big "if"). The advertised value proposition The value proposition, particularly for desktop personal computer users, goes something like this. Hard disk drives, which are produced primarily by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), are generally very inexpensive on a per-gigabyte basis. To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check. This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years. For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives. The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a "cache" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost.  Potential winners and losers If the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers. Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high). The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers. The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives. A big caveat There have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives. In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap.  Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver "the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]" but it could allow users to "turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device." What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance. It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

To put this into perspective, it costs about $260 to purchase a 1-terabyte solid state drive for a notebook or desktop computer (one can spend much more for faster/better quality drives, though). A 4-terabyte hard disk drive (that's four times the storage capacity as the solid-state drive mentioned above), runs only about $163 as of a recent check. This means that the cost per gigabyte (or, more generally, cost per unit of storage capacity) of hard disk drives is still substantially lower than those of solid state drives, even as the latter's cost has come down considerably over the years. For users who require lots of storage space for, say, high-resolution videos, video games (a single modern triple-A game can take up over 100 gigabytes of space on a computer disk drive), or other large programs, building systems with all flash storage can be prohibitively expensive. At the same time, solid state drives are much faster than hard disk drives, so users may want to keep performance-sensitive applications on a solid-state drive, while relegating the remaining files and programs to higher-capacity but slower hard disk drives. The value proposition that Intel and its partners are advertising goes something like this: A small, but very fast Optane-based solid state storage drive (Intel says Optane is substantially faster than traditional NAND flash) acting as a "cache" to a large hard disk drive can allow a system to enjoy similar storage performance to one that's equipped with NAND-flash based storage drives for a much lower overall cost.  Potential winners and losers If the technology works as claimed and sees significant adoption, then there could be winners and losers. Among the potential winners, I see Intel, as it would be able to gain content share in personal computers by selling Optane-based solid state drives (Intel does not supply hard disk drives today, and while it does build consumer NAND-flash solid state drives, its share in the consumer market isn't high). The hard disk drive makers, too, could benefit. If Optane combined with hard disk drives really delivers the performance of all-flash desktop computers for a much lower price, then this could erode the value proposition of all-flash storage setups in some cases, potentially slowing the shift from hard disk drives to solid state drives in desktop personal computers. The losers would be vendors of solid state drives, as Optane Cache + hard disk drive could reduce demand for traditional flash-based solid state drives. A big caveat There have been lots of schemes like what Intel is proposing with its Optane caches done in the past, so this isn't exactly new. Hard disk drive makers have (and in some cases still do) offer hard disk drives with small NAND flash caches built in to try to deliver performance that's close to that of pure solid state drives. In 2011, Intel's Z68 desktop platform included a technology called Smart Response Technology (SRT) that allowed users to pair small flash-based storage drives with large hard disk drives to try to achieve solid state drive-like speed on the cheap.  Per AnandTech's testing, SRT didn't deliver "the same performance as a large dedicated [solid state drive]" but it could allow users to "turn any hard drive into a much higher performing storage device." What could potentially make the Optane-based version of this concept more interesting than previous efforts is that instead of pairing a small NAND-flash based solid state drive with a large hard disk drive, Intel is pairing Optane technology (which Intel says is much faster than NAND flash-based drives) with hard disk drives to try to get NAND-flash solid state drive-like performance. It'll be interesting to see how this technology fares in the real world and, perhaps more importantly, if system builders and consumers ultimately adopt it. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

In a statement late Friday, Sens. Richard Burr. R-N.C., the committee's chairman, and Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel's top Democrat, said the panel "will follow the intelligence where it leads." Burr and Warner said that as part of the investigation they will interview senior officials from the Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration. They said subpoenas would be issued "if necessary to compel testimony." Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) "We will conduct this inquiry expeditiously, and we will get it right," the senators said. A declassified intelligence report released last week said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the election to favor President-elect Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton, revelations that have roiled Washington. Trump and his supporters have staunchly resisted the findings and Trump has leveled a series of broadsides at U.S. intelligence agencies, even though he'll have to rely on their expertise to help him make major national security decisions once he takes over at the White House next week. He will be sworn in Jan. 20. At a news conference this week, Trump speculated that U.S. intelligence agencies might have leaked details about a classified briefing with him that included unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had collected compromising sexual and financial information about him. He said any such information was not true: "It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen." The bulk of the Senate Intelligence Committee's work will be done in secret, although the senators said they will hold open hearings when possible. "As the committee's investigation progresses, we will keep Senate leadership, and the broader body, apprised of our findings," Burr and Warner said. Democrats and some Republicans have pressed for a special, select bipartisan committee to conduct the investigation, but Republican leaders have maintained that the existing committees are capable of handling the inquiries. According to the committee's statement, the inquiry will include: — A review of the intelligence that informed the declassified report about Russia's interference in the election. — "Counterintelligence concerns" related to Russia and the election, "including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns." — Russian cyber activity and other "active measures" against the United States during the election and more broadly. ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The patches address vulnerabilities in the Merlin@home Transmitter, St. Jude Medical's remote monitoring system of implantable pacemakers and defibrillator devices. The security updates from St. Jude Medical arrived on the same day that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued separate statements detailing the vulnerabilities and advice for healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. "The FDA has reviewed information concerning potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with St. Jude Medical's Merlin@home Transmitter and has confirmed that these vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow an unauthorized user, i.e., someone other than the patient's physician, to remotely access a patient's RF-enabled implanted cardiac device by altering the Merlin@home Transmitter," the FDA said in its statement. "The altered Merlin@home Transmitter could then be used to modify programming commands to the implanted device, which could result in rapid battery depletion and/or administration of inappropriate pacing or shocks." The vulnerable medical IoT devices were originally found by security researcher MedSec in August 2016. MedSec partnered with investment research body Muddy Waters Capital and released a paper to the public disclosing the device vulnerabilities; the security flaws include flaws in the encryption of the radio frequency protocol used by the Merlin@home Transmitter remote monitoring system, as well as a backdoors to the devices. At the time, St. Jude Medical denied the vulnerabilities' existence and subsequently filed a lawsuit against MedSec and Muddy Waters for defamation through false medical device security findings. The lawsuit remains ongoing. St. Jude Medical has been criticized for not addressing the vulnerable devices for five months since the initial disclosure, being called "a particularly aggressive and hostile vendor" in a statement by Justine Bone, CEO and director at MedSec, based in Miami. A separate statement from Muddy Waters also harshly criticized St. Jude Medical for the patches, saying "the announced fixes do not appear to address many of the larger problems, including the existence of a universal code that could allow hackers to control the implants." The statement from St. Jude Medical emphasizes the "extremely low cybersecurity risks" this vulnerability poses to the medical devices, and it advises users of the Merlin@home Transmitter to ensure it is powered on and connected to the internet so it can receive the automatic patch download. The bigger picture of vulnerable devices The FDA's guidance on handling the St. Jude Medical device vulnerabilities follows closely on the heels of its more general medical device cybersecurity guidance. Internet-connected devices are a growing security concern, and the FDA has focused on both general IoT device security and, specifically, medical IoT device security. "In today's world of medical devices that are connected to a hospital's network or even a patient's own internet service at home, we see significant technological advances in patient care and, at the same time, an increase in the risk of cybersecurity breaches that could affect a device's performance and functionality," wrote Suzanne Schwartz, M.D., in a FDA blog post from Dec. 27, 2016. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also addresses the security risks associated with internet-connected devices with a recently launched contest to create a tool to protect home IoT devices. In other news: The Email Privacy Act was reintroduced on Jan. 9 by U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.). The act, which updates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), requires all government agencies to obtain a warrant to search citizens' electronic communications. Previously, under the ECPA, the government could search any email older than 180 days stored on a third-party server without a warrant. "As a result of Congress' failure to keep pace with technological developments, every American is at risk of having their emails warrantlessly searched by government agencies," Polis said in a statement. "The Email Privacy Act will update, and bring our archaic laws into the 21st century, and protect Americans' Fourth Amendment privacy rights, whether they're communicating through pen-and-paper mail or email. Americans justly demand this level of privacy, and I remain confident that the bill will swiftly pass Congress." The bill unanimously passed the House of Representatives in 2016 419-0, but it didn't make it to the Senate Judiciary Committee for a vote. Juniper Networks issued an advisory for a flaw in SRX Series firewalls that are upgraded using the partition option. The issue affects devices that are upgraded from Junos OS releases prior to 12.1X46-D65, but upgrading to a version of the OS without the flaw won't fix the problem. The flaw allows root logins without a password. While upgrading to an unaffected OS doesn't get rid of the flaw, according to the security bulletin, "the symptoms are immediately obvious after an affected upgrade and may be remediated by rebooting the device post-upgrade." GoDaddy had to revoke more than 6,000 SSL certificates on Jan. 10 as a result of a software bug. GoDaddy learned of the bug on Jan. 6, though it was inadvertently introduced in July 2016. The bug affected approximately 6,100 GoDaddy customers -- less than 2% of the certificates issued since July 2016. "In a typical process, when a certificate authority like GoDaddy validates a domain name for an SSL certificate, they provide a random code to the customer and ask them to place it in a specific location on their website. When their system searches and finds the code, the validation is complete," explained Wayne Thayer, GoDaddy's vice president and general manager of security products. "However, when the bug was introduced, certain web server configurations caused the system to provide a positive result to the search, even if the code was not found." GoDaddy is reissuing the certificates -- 8,850 in total -- at no cost to the affected customers. On the same day the annual ESET security report praised the Microsoft Edge browser for having no exploits in the wild, two Edge vulnerabilities were reportedly added to the Sundown exploit kit. The two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201, include issues with the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine in Edge. They were first reported by Google Project Zero and were fixed by Microsoft in November 2016. However, a proof-of-concept exploit was posted Jan. 4 by security firm Theori, and the security researcher known as Kafeine confirmed the exploits are being added to the Sundown exploit kit. The timing is unfortunate, since ESET's "Windows Exploitation in 2016" report sang high praises of Edge, reading "It is worth noting that in the last year, no vulnerabilities have been found for the Edge web browser that are known to have been exploited in the wild. From our point of view, this situation with Edge was predictable, because, unlike IE11, Edge keeps modern security features turned on by default."

In a new ad posted Friday to YouTube, the computer technology maker pitches its “360 Replay Technology” — which the company said combines images from multiple high-definition cameras into seemless footage. The ad will air during the Super Bowl. Advertisement The apparent result gives viewers dramatic, swooping pans of athletes in action (it “makes anything look epic,” says Intel’s announcer in the ad), or in the case of this ad, Brady’s toothbrushing regimen. Sadly, it doesn’t appear Brady is wearing his specially designed athletic recovery sleepwear in the new ad.

It’s not a state of panic or anything like that for Oklahoma in the secondary, but you can feel the urgency from defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks. After a season where OU’s secondary didn’t play up to the standard Cooks had set in 2015, the goal is obviously to get back to that mark or be even better than what it was in 2015. One way Cooks seems to be doing that is by attacking the secondary without any position in mind for a lot of the recruits. It’s not about being a cornerback or a safety or a nickelback. It’s about being a defensive back that brings a variety of weapons to the table. You can see that in someone like OKC John Marshall’s Justin Broiles, now officially enrolled at OU and living in Norman. And you can see that in Cooks’ two latest offers made during the first day of the contact period Thursday. http://www.scout.com/player/193614-russ-yeast?s=73 Greenwood (Ind.) Center Grove ATH Russ Yeast (committed to Louisville) Yeast was a beast at the Under Armour All-America Game. Suppose the question here is going to be where does Yeast want to play? If he wants to stick on offense, then the Cardinals are his best bet. If he’s OK with looking at defense, then the Sooners should have a shot. Yeast is 5-11, which is right in line with the type of kids Cooks has been eyeing during the last year. Cooks is expected to visit Yeast early next week, and then we should all have a better idea of where things stand. http://www.scout.com/player/211191-sam-barnes?s=73 Richmond (Texas) George Ranch CB Samuel Barnes With Jaylon Johnson going out the door, it was back to finding a defensive back for Cooks. Heading into the week, all eyes were on Barnes. And boom, just like that, the offer was made to the 6-foot-1 athlete who has been racking up the offers here lately. Barnes said he didn’t have his visit schedule finalized when contacted by Sooners Illustrated on Thursday afternoon. It does feel like OU will get a visit from Barnes. And with the way OU has operated this recruiting cycle, next week would feel like the weekend. Sooners seem to want to have as much of this class done by the final weekend as humanly possible. “Reserve your spot” has carried the day with this cycle, and it will again here. Right now? These are the two defensive back prospects. The Sooners will definitely not take both of them so whoever is willing to make the call first, is going to be rolling with the band.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Army Testing Drone-Killing Ground Missiles Watch: Unreal toe-drag catch dooms Cowboys Pac-12 Battle for Speedy WR Travell Harris?

Now, Tom Brady is showing off more of his comedic talents in a new Super Bowl commercial. The 30-second commercial, which will air on Super Bowl Sunday, features the former U of M quarterback and current New England Patriots QB in an ad for Intel.

Predictions, Pt. 4: Great Expectations for Blockchain, AI, and Robotics January 13, 2017 by Jacqueline Prause 128 January 13, 2017 by Jacqueline Prause 128 Cognitive is the new “smart.” Use cases mushroom around blockchain distributed ledger technology. Finance gets excited about robotics process automation.  And for the kids, augmented reality livens up K-12 education. Those were some of the amazing predictions shared by the experts who appeared this week on Coffee Break with Game-Changers  2017 Predictions Special – Part 4 presented by SAP. Host Bonnie D. Graham asked 16 leading experts, academics, and business influencers what they see in their crystal ball for 2017. Each person was given just two minutes to share their predictions for what the next year holds for their industry, business, the world, and technology. Here’s what they had to say: 1. 2017 is about breaking the hype bubble around digital transformation on two major fronts: getting to meaningful use cases and consolidating technology. For meaningful use cases, Go-to-market and the business models around Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are the biggest challenge. The hyper-focus is going to be on use cases that can scale. For consolidating technology, this year is about stopping the insanity with IoT platforms. We’re at the peak of platform proliferation. – Jason Shepherd, Director of Strategy and Partnerships, Internet of Things (IoT), Dell 2. There are four big game-changers in 2017: Artificial Intelligence (AI) will help us think of cognitive as the new “smart”; augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will go mainstream; 5G technologies will be on the road in autonomous self-driving vehicles; blockchain technology will gain broader adoption. – Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT Strategy and Technology Office, Intel Corporation Cognitive is the new ‘smart,’ predicts Intel’s Bridget Karlin for 2017. 3. AI is going to go mainstream in 2017, both in ways you can see and in ways you can’t. We know that over half of corporate executives are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. It’s showing up in visual search; enterprise operations with cognitive computing and semantic matching; retail assortment planning and offer management; and semantic recognition. – Jeff Goldberg, Managing Director for Retail in North America, Accenture 4. Manufacturers are increasingly embedding sensors and technology into their products to make them smart. More of these devices are communicating with, controlling, or reacting to one another. This will continue in a big way, but most importantly, small to midsize businesses and manufacturers will start to gain a true competitive advantage from this technology. This will lead to an escalation of data collecting, analyzing, and sharing at these businesses. 2017 will be a big year for data management. – Jeff Doneghue, Director, Product Lifecycle Management & Engineering Services, BUNN 5. 2017 is going to be a phenomenal year in IoT. Cost will go down due to narrow-band IoT. IoT is going to be exposed in terms of high-value solutions to enterprise and industrial users. As a result, more things will be connected and the value – not the cost – of those things will increase. That’s going to ultimately drive a lot more data. You’ll see increased interest in deeper analytics, machine learning, and AI. With this sea of data, we’re going to need to create value quicker. – Fred Yentz, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Telit 6. There’s going to be a big increase in location-based marketing. Companies are going to start to leverage all kinds of sophisticated tools. They’re going to be able to track your mobile to the point that they know exactly what you’re going to be doing at what time; they’re going to know what context you’re going to be in – whether you’ve just entered a store or if you’ve just finished brushing your teeth. This will give the marketers the ability to target you in a very personalized fashion. Privacy will get pushed further behind. – Lil Mohan, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Marketing, University of Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business 7. My prediction is that organizations are going to focus much more attention on what Google calls ZMOT, Zero Moment of Truth. They’re going to train sellers to focus on delivering great experiences and engagement throughout the buying process. Sales leaders will need to make a greater investment in training and coaching their people to develop into the consultative, problem-solving, solution collaborators that buyers are expecting. – Barbara Giamanco, President, Social Centered Selling 8. In 2017, we’ll see more robotics coming into the supply chain area. We’ll also see more centralization and creation of centers of excellence in the supply chain due to lack of talent and the need to concentrate key capabilities and skills into more central positions. – Tanguy Caillet, Executive Director, EMEIA Center of Excellence for Supply Chain and Analytics, EY 9. I’m really excited about augmented reality in education, particularly in the K-12 world. There was an announcement by Google of being able to do some projects in a museum that allow you to use augmented reality in a Pokémon Go-like format. That could have huge, far-reaching effects with education of younger kids. – Charlie Cole, Chief Digital Officer, TUMI 10. There’s no doubt that healthcare reform is going to be a topic this year. Medical identity theft is an $84 billion dollar a year problem. Payment fraud is another problem. Also, electronic medical records have 10 percent duplicate records. A combination of these issues is creating a disturbance in the quality of data that physicians have at the point of care. Solving these problems is going to have to be the focus this year if we’re really going to get serious about value-based care. – Thomas Foley, Global Health Solutions Strategy Manager, LenovoHealth 11. In 2017 we’ll see the launch of autonomous cars. They’ll first appear in cities around a shared-ride model or shared-car model, and also in heavy transportation. – David Fowler, Senior Director for Services Marketing, SAP America 12. Excitement is coming to the world of finance. We’ll see more things like robotics process automation and cognitive learning capabilities helping to speed up mundane activities like entering invoices. – Srikanth Tamma, Senior Manager, Technology Practice, Deloitte Consulting 13. Small businesses are optimistic about 2017. Two studies show: businesses that plan, track, and monitor grow 30 percent faster than those who don’t; and 60 percent of businesses that fail were profitable when they failed. Business technology can make it much easier to plan and, most importantly, monitor cash flow. I predict that in 2017 we’ll see more small businesses moving all or part of their accounting and business processes to the cloud. – Linda Hamilton, CPA 14. Customer experience and design will be recognized by more companies. The word to watch is “convergence” – meaning online and offline convergence, hardware and software convergence, analog and digital convergence. For example, companies that are creating analog services will add some digital aspects, and companies offering an offline service will add some online aspects, too. – Janaki Kumar, VP and Head of Design and Co-Innovation Center, SAP Labs Palo Alto 15. Blockchain distributed ledger technology will mature. There will be a lot of little breakthroughs this year, and recognition of its broader applicability is going to grow. Today people associate it with Bitcoin and payment technology, but there are so many ways to put the technology to use. Walmart uses blockchain to establish authentication and traceability in its food chain; a French financial services company started a blockchain project to establish compliance with customer rules; and there’s an anti-counterfeiting blockchain service that can be used for authenticating diamonds and luxury goods. – Robert Kugel, CFA, Senior Vice President and Research Director, Ventana Research 16. HR needs to begin the evolution of not just using the term “cloud technology” but will also need to show the value to their organizations and how they will leverage that technology. – Tony Cusat, VP Operations, Globalview, ADP You can hear the full show at SAP Game-Changers 2017 Predictions – Part 4 SAP Game-Changers Radio 2017 Predictions Special – Upcoming Show For dozens of other insightful predictions that can impact you and your business in 2017 and beyond, listen to all five episodes of SAP’s Game-Changers Radio 2017 Predictions Special.

WhatsApp, its owner Facebook or even the US government can access user messages due to an encryption loophole discovered in the application, The Guardian newspaper reported, citing a security expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys,” Tobias Boelter told the newspaper. The security backdoor involves the application resending offline users' messages with new encryption keys, unknown to both senders and receivers. The rebroadcasting theoretically allows WhatsApp or Facebook to tap into conversations to read single messages or entire conversations, according to the researcher. © Photo: Collage Germany Bans Mass Data Exchange Between Facebook, WhatsAppBoelter stressed that the feature is not inherent in the WhatsApp Signal protocol, adding that Facebook was warned of the backdoor undermining user privacy but responded stating this was expected and was not being addressed. WhatsApp, which is used by around one billion people, has been at the center of a privacy controversy since being acquired by Facebook in 2014. The social network at first pledged not to interfere with the existing privacy rules and to minimize the number of advertisements, but privacy policy changes came about in 2016, allowing more data sharing between the two platforms. The data sharing was halted after the European Union charged Facebook with providing misleading information on its merger with WhatsApp. ...

Holmes is here with the details on that, good morning, T.J. Stra, I know how much you love quarterbacks. So this one is for you. You could get a double dose of Tom Brady at the super bowl if his patriots make it to the super bowl you'll see him on the field throwing touchdown passes but also see him during the commercial breaks making pancakes and brushing his teeth. Intel 360 replay makes anything look epic. Reporter: Just over three weeks to go till game day and getting our first look at a super bowl commercial. Literally anything. ??? Reporter: Tom Brady stars in this ad for Intel showing off its 360-degree replay technology. Wait till you see it in the game. Reporter: Super bowl ads are expected to be $5 million for a 30-second spot. Companies are prereleasing ads to get the most bang for their buck. If they get people talking about their ad early it's got Tom Brady who's football royalty. Reporter: Own others revealing enough to keep us hungry. Snickers has "Star wars" guy, Adam driver. I will finish what you started. Companies advertising like Snickers with their creative ads are trying to tap into popular culture and a certain zeitgeist. He's eating doritos. Reporter: Some are skipping the game altogether. Don't expect to see staples like doritos or butterfinger but Intel is hoping to score with Tom Brady whether he's on the field or not. Enough, they get it. You're loving that, weren't you, stra? I wanted to hit him. You still want to hit people? For old time's sake. Intel, the first time they advertised in the super bowl technology used during the broadcast that 360. I guess Brady is not afraid of jinxing himself. It's great. He has four rings. He's all right. He's all right. Thank you, T.J. Have a great weekend. Y'all too. You're going to watch football. You know I am. Yeah. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

HTC also launched its latest range of handsets, the U Play and U Ultra, which can tell owners what to wear and when to set their alarm through an intelligent assistant called Sense Companion. In weirder news, the Hushme mask promised to block the sound of a wearer's voice when on the phone to prevent bystanders eavesdropping.  Here's a roundup of some of the best gadgets that also caught our eye this week:  Smartphone that can read fat content Chinese television manufacturer Changhong has teamed up with molecular sensing experts to create a mobile phone that can analyse the fat content of food and people, as well as the chemical make up of of physical products. The Changhong H2 can help owners pick the sweetest punnet of strawberries Credit: SCiO  The Changhong H2 smartphone has an in-built SCiO sensor, a near-infrared spectrometer, that can detect molecule types by bouncing light off a physical product or liquid.  It can provide the properties of food, drinks, medication and human bodies to help consumers authenticate their pills and eat healthily. For example, users can check how sweet strawberries are before buying them and monitor their body fat. The phone also has a 16-megapixel camera and fingerprint sensor.  Wireless 'merged reality' headset  The latest VR headset to enter a busy field is Intel's Project Alloy, a prototype of a 'merged reality' device that combines scans of objects in the real world with those in the virtual. It has been designed for a wireless experience that will let users play VR games and move around the room without a tether.  Project Alloy is a 'merged reality' headset that's completely wireless Credit: Getty Intel is teaming up with major headset manufacturers to produce the device, with production expected towards the end of this year. In a demo of the system, the company showed how Alloy can transform objects in a room into obstacles in a game to help gamers immerse themselves. It is one part of the chip maker's future-gazing projects that utilise 5G communications.  Turn your Apple Watch into a monitor  If you place the Apple Watch on its side while charging, it displays the time in a way that’s easy to read in the dark, but the sight of the watch attached to its charger isn’t exactly elegant. Accessories company Elago has a neat solution: a stand that looks like the original Macintosh. The accessory makes a mini-monitor out of an Apple Watch Credit: Elago Pop the charger round the back and clip the watch’s strap around the stand, and you’ve got a miniature version of the iconic computer, which was released in 1984. Unfortunately, you can’t change the Apple Watch’s sleep screen to make it match the Macintosh's retro cool. App to help keep New Year's resolutions The Nagbot chat bot was created to help people keep up their New Year's resolutions. It sends periodic nagging messages to guilt-trip and remind users to stick to their goals. Nagbot helps users keep their resolutions Credit: Nagbot For example, it will ask if they have performed a task they said they would. When it gets a positive response it praises the user, but sends abuse in the event of a negative.  Nagbot is accompanied by an app where users can check their progress over time.  ces 2017 weirdest gadgets   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Gadgets Mobile phones Apple Watch Apple Show more Technology latest 15 Jan 2017, 5:35pm Comment: Let's not let artificial intelligence become another bubble James Titcomb Premium 14 Jan 2017, 11:00pm Comment: Fake news on Facebook probably isn't that influential, until it bubbles out into the open James Carson Premium 14 Jan 2017, 3:04am Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton leaving after 13 years for top role at Snapchat firm 13 Jan 2017, 4:42pm Could buying Twitter and shutting it down be Mexico's answer to Donald Trump? 13 Jan 2017, 4:21pm Nintendo Switch to be released on March 3 at UK price of £280 13 Jan 2017, 1:07pm WhatsApp messages could be read by exploiting security backdoor 13 Jan 2017, 11:04am Nintendo shares drop as high price of Switch console dismays investors Gallery 13 Jan 2017, 11:01am Gallery: From The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to Shenmue 3: the 40 most anticipated video games of 2017 12 Jan 2017, 4:25pm Nintendo Switch: 6 questions to be answered 12 Jan 2017, 12:59pm HTC U phone tells owners to wear extra clothes if it's cold 12 Jan 2017, 11:06am Peace sign selfies could let hackers copy your fingerprints 12 Jan 2017, 10:28am Facebook is working on ways to read thoughts, job adverts suggest 03:39 11 Jan 2017, 4:54pm Nintendo Switch: Price, release date and everything else we know 11 Jan 2017, 2:00pm Instagram to show more adverts by putting them in Stories 11 Jan 2017, 1:07pm Comment: Why are robots still so rubbish?

If at all, very few people want a manual gearbox. Pounding a clutch back and forth in rush-hour traffic in a city like Lagos for instance, may be hellish for many motorists. Sector statistic shows that only 3.9 per cent of cars sold in U.S. were built with manual transmissions. In fact, in 20 years to come it may not be out of place to say that knowing how to manually drive a car may not be necessary at all. Radar, lidar, GPS, odometry, and computer vision may be all that car owners require to get their cars moving. Driverless car, otherwise called autonomous or self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. It uses advanced control systems to interpret sensory information. The control systems help it to identify appropriate navigation paths, obstacles and relevant signage. Google and General Motor, same organisation that first introduced automatics transmission to the market in 1940 may have been in the news, when it comes to driverless cars than any other organisation but demonstrative systems, precursory to autonomous cars did not start with them. The development date back to the 1920s and 30s but what could be called the first truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University’s Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich’s Eureka Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organisations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles. Until recently, self driving cars seemed like a dream that can only become feasible in decades to come. But the innovation is fast becoming a reality. More than a fiction, it appears set that the development will alter the future of mobility. Most carmakers and technology giants, including Co-founder of Google, Eric Schmidt believe that your car should drive itself. “It’s amazing to me that we let humans drive cars… It’s a bug that cars were invented before computers,” Schmidt said. Transportation entrepreneur, who co-founded Zipcar, Robin Chase, shares Schmidt opinion. He is optimistic that driverless cars are “three-and-a-quarter years away”. This is in line with projections that years of trials on city streets, may translate to the possibility of having the innovation on roads by 2020. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) said levels of autonomous driving technology begin from zero to five. Level zero is no assistance. Level two is the level at which all semi-autonomous systems on the road are at currently. Level three extends to “some driving modes but handle elevated levels of automated driving in given parameters. At level four, almost full driverless is attained but it is limited to “some driving modes.” Level five is full autonomy. With some vehicle already driverless partially, recent timeline of self-driving cars shows Volvo releasing 100 self-driving cars on public roads in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2017, a self-driving car startup that spun-off from Google late last year, Waymo, will be deploying its fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans onto public roads for the first time later this month. Ford will release an autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or throttle pedals, designed for ride-sharing by 2021. Toyota’s Research Institute, formed in 2015, aimed at rolling out cars with semi-autonomous features in 2020. BMW and Mobileye confirmed they would test 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of 2017. Nissan-Renault already announced Seamless Autonomous Mobility. Tesla also started installing hardware that can enable full autonomy. General Motors is expected to gain an advantage in the self-driving car space by conducting tests in snowy conditions. A Chinese internet company referred to as the Google of China, Baidu will test self-driving cars on public roads soon. Tesla is also looking at driving from Los Angeles to New York 2017 with its self-driving Tesla. Semi-autonomous Hyundai recently navigated on local streets around the Las Vegas Convention Center alongside other vehicles. Should self-driving car becomes a reality, the automotive sector will witness series of changes. One of such development will be witness in safety. Experts believe that humans are no good at driving as such the innovation would drastically reduce the 1.2m people killed every year on roads worldwide. Cars will park themselves, there will be free time, congestion is also expected to reduce. If congestion reduces, building new roads may be necessary. Highways Free time it’s planning to release Automobile industry think self-driving vehicles will be on the road by 2020 or before, says Richard Holman, head of foresight and trends at General Motors driverless vehicles are now nearing the live phase Yet we have barely begun to think about how they will revolutionise our lives, revamp our cities — and destroy tens of millions of jobs. pipe dream relegated to a far-off decade in the future. But then, last week, Ford announced that in 2021 it’s planning to release an autonomous car without a steering wheel, brake or throttle pedals, designed for ride-sharing. Just a few days later, Volvo and Uber made public their partnership to develop a driverless car. Now, it seems autonomous cars aren’t just a fanciful future prospect but rather something tangible — and a real part of mobility in the near future.The Ford and Volvo/Uber announcements, though, highlight the different approaches each company working on autonomous driving technology is taking. For example, some, like Audi, are introducing autonomous systems slowly into their products to indoctrinate their buyers to the tech. Others, like Ford, are jumping straight to driverless cars. Accordingly, we’ve compiled an alphabetical autonomy timeline encompassing the announcements and plans of the leaders in the space. What’s more, we’ve underlined the technology that each company aims to utilize to drive its driverless cars. SAE automated driving levels The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) said levels of autonomous driving technology begin from zero to five. Level zero is no assistance. Level two is the level at which all semi-autonomous systems on the road are at currently. Level three extends to “some driving modes but handle elevated levels of automated driving in given parameters. At level four, almost full driverless is attained but it is limited to “some driving modes.” Level five is full autonomy. to “all driving modes . Level 1 is defined by systems like collision mitigation braking that automatically brake if a collision is imminent. . These include acceleration, braking and steering assistance. ” By that, it means the car can— like on a freeway during the daylight. However, it’s expected that the human driver can take over driving duties, if asked. SEE ALSO: Mercedes’ new all-electric Maybach coupe concept puts Tesla to shame Level 5 takes full autonomy to “all driving modes.” That means the car is fully capable of driving itself anywhere in any condition, from a snowy, moonlit road to an unmapped desert. It should be noted that, at this point, Level 5 is theoretical. One Audi representative went so far as to describe it as “mythical.” It’s unlikely we’ll see Level 5 autonomous driving in our lifetimes. Audi 2016 — Level 2: Audi’s Level 2 “Traffic Jam Assist” system is available on the 2017 Audi A4 and Q7. The system uses steering input to keep the car in its lane. What’s more, it allows the driver to take his or her hands off the wheel in slow-moving traffic for 15 seconds at a time. However, the driver can’t check out or turn attention away from the road, as he or she must intervene immediately if prompted by the car. 2018 — Level 3: Audi pledges to be the first carmaker to introduce Level 3 autonomy to the road with its next generation A8 full-size sedan. The A8 will debut Audi’s Traffic Jam Pilot system. It will handle accelerating, braking and steering up to 35 mph. However, there are many parameters and limitations to engaging Traffic Jam Pilot. It will need to have no fewer than two cars ahead of it and it will need to recognize, based upon information GPS and other outward-facing sensors, that it is on a freeway. Its cameras will also detect whether the road is clear enough for ideal operation. It won’t be activated on a snow-covered road, for example. The car will also require specific driver conditions before Traffic Jam Pilot can be engaged, too. It will need to detect a driver in the driver’s seat. What’s more, the car will include a camera-based driver awareness system that will look to see if the driver is awake and not incapacitated in some way (suffering a pulmonary embolism, for example). 2020/2021 — Level 3 Plus: Two or three years after the first application Level 3, Audi will roll out what it’s roughly defining as “higher” Level 3. That means it will take the capability of Traffic Jam Pilot and extend it up to full freeway speeds. It will require the same freeway verification from GPS and other sensors before it is engaged. Audi will include in each car an event data recorder Additionally, with Level 3, Audi will include in each car an event data recorder (think an airplane’s black box). It will record the driving data directly preceding a collision, should one occur. Don’t worry, Audi won’t be recording all your driving data. The event data recorder will be constantly deleting the data it collects, if a collision doesn’t take place. Late 2020s — Level 4: Full highway and urban autonomy. These functions will only be allowed in pre-mapped and geofenced areas. That means these cars will not be able to drive autonomously everywhere. You couldn’t ask the car to autonomously drive from Los Angeles to New York, for example, unless the route were mapped and programmed. Tech: GPS, LIDAR (Light Imaging, Detection And Ranging), short- and long-range radar, and no fewer than two digital cameras will be needed for Audi’s autonomous cars. In total, Audi’s autonomous cars will have around 24 sensors with almost 360-degree redundancy. In addition, the cars will include redundant steering and braking systems. BMW 2016 — Level 2: With the all-new 7 Series, BMW introduced several new Level 2 technologies: Traffic jam Assistant and driverless automated parking. Traffic jam Assistant can follow the car ahead on the highway and can read lane markings and add corrective steering to keep the car in its lane. This system works from 0 to 43 mph. European versions of the new BMW 7 Series feature a self-parking function that doesn’t require a driver inside the car. With the car’s key fob, a driver can exit the vehicle and direct the car into a parking spot. However, that function is not available here in the U.S. Tech: Radar, digital cameras. 2021 — Level 4: Marking its 100th birthday earlier this year, BMW announced that it has also pegged 2021 as the year during which it will unveil a fully autonomous car. It’s called iNext and not only will it be autonomous, it will also be intelligent, lightweight and the “next generation of electro-mobility,” according to BMW chairman of the board Harald Krüger. The flagship iNext autonomous car will be created in collaboration with Intel and MobilEye. Although BMW has not yet specified any other dates for unveiling autonomous driving systems for its cars, the trio (BMW, Intel and MobilEye) have said they will create platform-based “future-proof” test cars by 2017 in order to hit the stated 2021 goal. This platform will tackle, as BMW puts it, “‘eyes off’ (Level 3), ‘mind off’ level (Level 4)” ‘driver off’ (Level 5).” Tech: BMW hasn’t indicated specifically which tech will drive drive its autonomous cars, except Intel Atom and Xeo processors. Ford 2019 — Level 2: In 2019 (or within three years of 2016), Ford plans to introduce two Level 2 autonomous systems: Traffic Jam Assist and Fully Automated Parking. Confusingly, Ford’s Level 2 system will carry the same name as Audi’s Level 3. Traffic Jam Assist, like other Level 2 systems on the road today, will follow a car ahead in traffic and control braking and acceleration as well as steering to keep the car in its lane. Tech: Radar, digital cameras and ultrasonic sensors. 2021 — Level 4: Ford announced in August that in 2021, it will have driverless ride-sharing cars without a steering wheel, or brake or accelerator pedals. Unlike Audi and Nissan, which are slowly ramping up autonomy step by step from Level 2 to 3 to 4, Ford is jumping several steps and going right to 4. While there could be many reasons for this, presumably price is the leading factor. At first, the cars will be prohibitively expensive to sell in Ford showrooms Since it’s five years out, Ford doesn’t yet know what platform these cars will ride on, what they’ll look like or what will power them (gasoline or electrified powertrains). Ford did divulge that these cars will not be initially available for purchase by customers. That could change, however, as the cost of the onboard tech goes down. Likely, at first, the cars will be prohibitively expensive to offer up in Ford showrooms. And because Ford is keen to make autonomy available to the masses as quickly as possible, it doesn’t want to keep the tech relegated to extremely expensive luxury vehicles like Audi’s flagship A8. It’s important we understand why these Ford steering wheel-less cars are Level 4 and not Level 5. As we discussed earlier, Level 5 is defined by the SAE as a car’s ability to drive autonomous in ‘all driving modes.’ The Ford cars simply won’t be able to do that. They’ll only be allowed to operate in 3D-mapped, geofenced locations. Imagine, then, that these will operate in a few heavily mapped urban environments. So, unless you live in one of the first markets for the Ford autonomous cars, it’s unlikely they’ll be a regular part of your life in the near future. Tech: LIDAR, radar, digital cameras, 3D maps, 4G connectivity and, according to a Ford representative, possible vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) communication technology. Honda 2016 — Level 2: Unlike the luxury brands on this list, Honda has pushed its Honda Sensing suite of autonomous driving technologies down into its most affordable models, including the $20,440 Civic Sedan. Honda Sensing includes Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) that follows the vehicle ahead, and Lane Keep Assist (LKAS), which uses a forward-facing camera that watches lane markings to keep the vehicle in its lane. Honda Sensing also includes Forward Collision Warning, Collision Mitigation Braking, Lane Departure Warning and Road Departure Mitigation Further bucking the trend of other systems on this list, Honda Sensing can be activated at any speed. Although it’s not locked to highways and freeways by GPS- or camera-based data, it’s recommended for use on freeways and not backroads or urban environments. 2020 — Level 3: By 2020, Honda aims to have basic automated highway driving from “on ramp to off ramp.” Honda is being very conservative with its promised automated timelines beyond that, however. As such, it is hesitant to give specific dates for fear of missing them due to unforeseen technical or legislative hurdles. That said, Honda contends it is at the forefront of automated vehicle research. Honda has divulged, though, that by 2020 it also wants to integrate Wi-Fi-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology into its vehicles. Allowing cars and infrastructure to communicate with one another will add an extra level of automation. 2040: Ultimately, no matter where its automated tech is, be it Level 3 or 4, Honda aims to have no crashes in Honda or Acura vehicles by 2040. Tech: Radar, digital cameras, Wi-Fi-based V2V and V2X. Kia 2020 — Level 3: Kia announced at CES 2016 that it is launching an autonomous driving sub-brand called “DRIVE WISE.” Additionally, the Korean carmaker benchmarked 2020 as the date by which it would introduce its first semi-autonomous tech. Although Kia is in the fledgling stages of developing its semi- and full-autonomy tech, it’s already named some of the systems. They include Highway Autonomous Driving (HAD), Preceding Vehicle Following (PVF), Emergency Stop System (ESS) and Traffic Jam Assist (TJA). 2030 — Level 4: Kia also announced that by 2030 it would be ready to introduce full autonomy. These include systems it’s calling Urban Autonomous Driving (UAD) and Autonomous Valet Parking. Tech: HAD relies on radar and cameras. UAD utilizes GPS and exterior sensors to identify the car’s position on the road. It also will rely on live traffic updates. Like Audi, Kia’s Driver Status Monitoring (DSM) system in its autonomous cars will monitor the driver’s face and if it detects he or she isn’t paying attention, the car will move to the side of the road and come to a stop. Benz interiorMercedes-Benz 2016 — Level 2: In 2013, Mercedes released its first Level 2 automated driving system, called DISTRONC PLUS with Steering Assist, which we tested on the Mercedes-AMG C63 S last year. Since then, the German automaker has released its newest and more robust Level 2 system, DRIVE PILOT, which debuted on the 2017 E-Class. DRIVE PILOT is fairly robust for a Level 2 autonomous system. Like Honda Sensing, it can control braking and acceleration at or above regular highway speeds. It also allows the driver to go hands-free for as long as 60 seconds at a time up to speeds of 81 mph. Distinctively, DRIVE PILOT can autonomously change lanes, if a driver indicates a lane change with the turn signals. Of course, if it detects a car in the other lane, it won’t carry out the maneuver. The 2017 E-Class is the only production car that has been granted an autonomous driving license in Nevada. That means, DRIVE PILOT is far more capable than Mercedes allows it to be in its current form. However, Mercedes engineers have retarded the capabilities of DRIVE PILOT for the E-Class to ensure drivers understand that they are ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the car. Additionally, the all-new E-Class is also the first production car to include V2V technology. At first, this means all new E-Classes will be able to communicate important road and driving information to one another. In the future, as other cars receive the tech, this means E-Classes will be able to communicate with other cars as well — not just its brand mates. In addition to cars, Mercedes is testing autonomous semi trucks here in the U.S. and in Europe. In fact, it has been sending “platooning” fleets of self-driving semis across Europe this year with the intention of integrating driverless tech into commercial trucking in the near future. Tech: Radar, digital cameras, and V2V. Nissan 2016 — Level 2: Nissan announced earlier this year that by 2020, it will have not just one but 10 fully autonomous models on sale. It also laid out its roadmap for how it will get there, adding a new level of autonomy every two years. This year, the Japanese automaker will introduce its first Level 2 system called ProPILOT. This system will be first introduced to the Japanese market in the new Serena minivan. Nissan will then introduce it to the European marked in 2017 in the Qashqai crossover. Nissan hasn’t yet said when the tech will be debuted for the U.S. market. At this level of ProPILOT, the car will have what Nissan is calling “single-lane control” in heavy, stop-and-go traffic on highways. 2018 — Level 3: Two years later, in 2018, Nissan will introduce ProPILOT 2.0 with “multiple-lane control.” ProPILOT 2.0 will add autonomous lane changes to the ProPILOT capabilities. 2020 — Level 4: By 2020, Nissan plans to reveal ProPILOT 3.0 with “intersection autonomy.” This will take Level 4 autonomy into the urban centers. Although Nissan hasn’t specifically divulged it, it’s likely that — as with Audi and Ford — these cars won’t be able to go anywhere. Instead, ProPILOT 3.0 activation will be limited to heavily mapped areas. Tech: Similar to other carmakers, ProPILOT and its variants will rely on radar, digital cameras and hi-def mapping technology. A Nissan representative admitted detailed maps will be required for ProPILOT 3.0, which indicates it, too, will be limited in its operational availability. Tesla 2015 — Level 2: Late last year, Tesla unveiled the now infamous Level 2 Autopilot system, which is part of a suite of driver assistance systems. These include Autosteer, Auto Lane Change, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Side Collision Warning and Autopark. Setup Timeout Error: Setup took longer than 30 seconds to complete. Autopilot has been implicated in several crashes around the globe since its debut. Most notably, a Tesla driver died in a crash in Florida in early May with Autopilot engaged. He was reportedly watching a Harry Potter DVD while his Model S was operating in Autopilot mode. Until Mercedes released its DRIVE PILOT, Tesla’s Autopilot was the only semi-autonomous system on the market that allowed for autonomous lane changes. This is not its only distinction, however. Autopilot is, from the driver’s standpoint, the most robust system currently on the market. It’s that robustness that’s gotten Tesla in trouble, though. Specifically, Consumer Reports recently called on Tesla to disable and rename Autopilot until it was made safer. Notably, Autopilot is in public beta-testing. In fact, Tesla is the only carmaker beta-testing autonomous tech on the public. All other carmakers relegate testing to its engineers and employees. Tech: Radar and a digital camera 2018 — Level 4: Tesla won’t confirm the exact timing of Level 4 autonomous driving or the tech sensors that will drive higher levels of autonomy. However, Elon Musk said in late 2015 that Tesla was two years away from full autonomy. Tech: It’s unclear what tech Tesla plans to add to its cars to enable higher levels of autonomy. That said, during the launch of Autopilot, Elon Musk revealed the company was gathering hi-def digital maps with its cars. Likely, this information will be utilized to implement Level 4 autonomy in future products. Volvo 2016 — Level 2: For the 2017 model year of its vehicles, like the S90 sedan, Volvo introduced Pilot Assist, a semi-autonomous driving system. Like other Level 2 systems, it follows traffic ahead and keeps the car within its lane. Though, that’s not the only news Volvo has made in the autonomous driving realm for 2016. This summer, Volvo Cars and ride-sharing service Uber announced they were joining forces to develop autonomous driving cars. 2017 — Level 4: Intriguingly, Volvo is skipping Level 3 and going straight to Level 4. However, it won’t be a broad-scale rollout — at first. The Swedish carmaker has said it will have 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads Beijing in 2017, as a part of its Drive-Me program. Volvo plans to lease autonomous cars to customers in Sweden that year as well. These cars will be Level 4. Like so many other brands, the first autonomous Volvo cars will only be able to drive themselves on highways known to the GPS system. This is more than an estimation, though. Volvo has already detailed what its self-driving car interface will look like. What’s more, Volvo has even announced that it is working with Ericsson to stream your favorite shows in the dashboard of your autonomous car in the future. Think its Concept 26 autonomous car interior, but in real life. 2020 — Though Volvo will be achieving Level 4 before 2020, it has made two projections for that year. First it aims to offer autonomous cars to the public — likely on a broader scale than in 2017. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it has long promised that no one will be killed or seriously injured in a Volvo by 2020. Of course, autonomy is the ultimate safety system. So, it makes sense that large-scale implementation of Level 4 autonomy would intersect with that safety benchmark that year. Tech: Volvo has openly listed the tech that will allow its future cars to drive autonomously. They include (but are not limited to) trifocal cameras, ultrasonic sensors, surround view cameras, surround radar, long-range radar and combined radar and camera units.

And this year was no exception, with thousands of pieces of new technology making their debut in Las Vegas. After approximately 50,000 steps over the course of four days, we have picked out the best of the best on show at . From brilliant laptops to amazing automotive technology this is our choice of the products which wowed CES, and which we think will be some of the finest things to buy this year. Best of show: Amazon Alexa Having made its debut on the Amazon Echo, Alexa was everywhere at CES. Whether you were looking at a simple wall-mounted speaker or a multi-thousand dollar television Alexa was likely to be built in. How useful Alexa will be when it's part of your car we're not sure, but clearly Amazon's approach of making Alexa open and getting into as many devices as possible is working. Best laptop: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon The fifth generation of the X1 Carbon ThinkPad takes the reliable, bullet-proof feeling design of its predecessors and adds a smaller bezel which brings the laptop closer to a 13in design's size despite having a 14in screen. And, at 1.12kg, it manages to include a battery which lasts a long, long time – like 15 hours or more. This is a beautiful, well-crafted machine which will run all day. What more can you want? Best computer peripheral: HP OMEN X35 Curved Display Curved displays aren't new, but HP's OMEN X35 Curved certainly represents a new benchmark for monitors for gamers or anyone who wants incredible performance from their display. It's also one of the first monitors to adopt Nvidia's G-Sync technology, designed to reduce tearing when a lot of things are happening on screen. In a category which some might claim lacks innovation, HP has managed to create a product which everyone will lust after. Best VR/AR product: Intel Project Alloy High-quality augmented reality is computationally tough, which is why Intel's Project Alloy is so impressive. Not only does it give you what Intel calls a “mixed reality” experience, capable of replacing real world objects with digital ones that you move around it does so with a completely self-contained headset. What's more, when we had a chance to test it out, we found it comfortable to wear. It's not ready for production yet - battery life is definitely an issue - but it's a glimpse of a really amazing future. Best tablet: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 The XPS 13 was pretty-much everyone's favourite laptop of last year, thanks to its combination of excellent design, long battery life, and a beautiful edge-to-edge screen. Now Dell has created a version of it that's a tablet too, one which makes the case for having a separate laptop and tablet harder to make. It's thin, light and well-balanced enough to make a great tablet, while also being a sleek, well-designed laptop. What more could you want? Best fitness tech: Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F20 Last year's Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 (snappy name, eh?) was an impressive first attempt at the smartwatch, but the new F20 version fixes the obvious omissions (GPS) and adds some great fitness features (downloadable maps, a more rugged design) to create a great fitness-focused smartwatch for the outdoor life. And if your hike is really long, you can switch the screen to monochrome mode and get a month's battery life out of it - enough to take you up Mount Everest and down again. Best automotive tech brand: BMW It's getting to the point where CES is becoming an important automotive show in its own right, with most of the major manufacturers there. This year's stand-out car maker was BMW, which demonstrated its HoloActive Touch interface system.

According to multiple sources, this dossier had been obtained by many news outlets and was the talk of the town among Washington people who are “in the know” on these kinds of things. There is now a raging debate about whether or not Buzzfeed should have made these documents available to the general public – with most of the big media publications coming down on the side of “no.” Kevin Drum examines both sides of the argument and ultimately comes down on the side of “yes,” Buzzfeed was right to publish the dossier, as does Vanessa Gazari, writing for the Columbia Journalism Review. Within Gazari’s argument is an example of why – regardless of where you stand on the journalistic merits – I have so little patience for the pearl-clutching about this from big media. Several aspects of the mainstream media’s reaction demand further scrutiny. Some critics seem to be saying that unless the information in an intelligence briefing or other leaked document can be independently verified by reporters, it shouldn’t be published. But did reporters independently verify all the allegations against Hillary Clinton and her allies contained in the emails released by WikiLeaks? An October story in The Hill details the allegation that Donna Brazile passed a debate question to the Clinton campaign, and contains this caveat in the fourth paragraph: “The emails, which have been made public in batches by WikiLeaks, have been largely unconfirmed and are believed to have been stolen by Russian intelligence.”…Why was it acceptable to publish that story based on an email, and not documents whose content intelligence officials considered important enough to share with the president and president-elect? I can think of another example. In April of last year, the NYT published a story titled, “Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal” that was largely based on information from the book “Clinton Cash” by Peter Schweitzer – who worked for Steve Bannon’s Government Accountability Institute at the time. I’ve written previously about how Bannon and his pals weaponized stories that were fed to the mainstream media. In this case, the NYT took the bait and ran with it. The contents of that article wound up in a Trump ad during the 2016 campaign with allegations of “pay for play” against Clinton, which were ultimately debunked at FactCheck.org. Beyond the practice of publishing unverified rumors that suggest pay for play, we here at the Washington Monthly were pretty outspoken during the election about the way outlets like the NYT covered stories on the Clinton Foundation and her emails. Here is the kind of thing we heard pretty regularly back then: Does the new batch of previously undisclosed State Department emails prove that big-money donors to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation got special favors from Mrs. Clinton while she was secretary of state? Not so far, but that the question arises yet again points to a need for major changes at the foundation now, before the November election. Let’s re-write that and see if it fits in the current situation: Does the new batch of previously undisclosed reports prove that the Trump campaign coordinated their efforts with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government? Not so far, but that the question arises yet again points to the need for major changes in the incoming administration. The constant refrain we’re hearing from major media outlets right now about why they didn’t release this dossier is that they haven’t been able to verify the information. What I would like from them is an accounting of the time, effort and money they have invested to do so. As of yet, none of them have proven the information contained in the reports to be false (other than saying that it was a different Michael Cohen who travelled to Prague last summer). What we don’t know is whether the information can’t be verified or if they’ve even tried. We currently have a lot of information about what Russia did to influence this election and how both Trump and his team have not only praised Putin, but built much of their foreign policy in a way that would benefit him. The possibility that ANY of the information contained in that dossier might be true would make the whole Watergate fiasco (which brought down a president) look like child’s play. Nothing is more important right now than getting to the bottom of this one. So spare me your pearl clutching, major media…it’s time to get to work on this story!

Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years By Stephen Lawson | Follow Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Jan 13, 2017 10:05 AM PT Email a friend To Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From

Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this AllSeen's merger with OCF brings IoT closer to common ground ZigBee's Dotdot language aims for IoT harmony Bluetooth 5 is out: Now will home IoT take off? Video Smart Cities: Barcelona A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

The company is sticking with its Racing theme for the new boards, and is releasing three variants: the Z270GT8, Z270GT6, and Z270GT4. The Racing Z270GT8 is the top-of-the-range model. The board boasts six physical PCIe x16 slots, although Biostar doesn't specifically list support for SLI or CrossFire. The GT8 thankfully skips the questionably-useful SATA Express connector in favor of an M.2 socket and two U.2 ports. The M.2 socket has its own dedicated heatsink, too. The mobo has USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports on the back panel, and supports quick-charging standards from both Qualcomm and Apple. Networking connectivity comes by way of an Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet controller. Biostar is clearly targeting the Z270GT8 at tweakers and tuners, as the board comes with a plethora of overclocking features including debug LEDs and a hardware dual-BIOS switch. The board even has a special switch to allow it to boot at temperatures below zero. There's also a handy "GT Touch" panel that lets users power on and reset the board, as well as select Speed or Eco presets. The audio circuitry is powered by a high-end Realtek ALC1220 codec. Biostar also includes RGB LED lighting (under the "Vivid LED DJ" moniker) and a 5050 connector for additional LED strips. The Racing Z270GT6 is a slight step-down from the GT8 board. It drops down to three physical PCIe x16 slots, one U.2 connector, and zero USB 3.1 connectors. The USB quick-charge functionality also goes away, and the audio codec gets downgraded to the Realtek ALC892. The GT6 does have a USB 3.0 Type-C port to make up for those cuts. Aside from those changes, this model is very similar to the GT8, down to the debug LEDs and GT Touch panel. Finally, the Racing Z270GT4 could be described as the microATX version of the GT6, as it shares most of its bigger brother's feature set. There's no heatsink on the M.2 slot this time around, and due to its size, there naturally aren't as many PCIe slots. However, where the GT6 only has DVI and HDMI outputs, the GT4 board actually has DVI, HDMI, VGA, and DisplayPort connectors. Biostar says the Racing Z270GT8 board will come as a bundle with a 256GB Intel 600p NVMe SSD for $330. The company bundles one of its own 240GB G300 SSDs with the Z270GT6 board for a final price of $210. The Z270GT4 instead gets a Vivid LED DJ-enabled fan as its bundled item, and will go for $130.   Tags: Motherboards User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Carrie Freeman is the managing partner of SecondMuse, responsible for the overall strategic direction and management of the company. Carrie is a thought leader on the roles and intersection of technology, sustainability, innovation and corporate responsibility. Prior to joining SecondMuse, Carrie worked for Intel Corporation as Director of Sustainable Business Innovation pioneering strategies such as a corporate impact investing fund and developing technology market solutions to solve global sustainability challenges. Carrie shares these poignant thoughts about the way we work. In the last century the world has seen an unprecedented expansion of economic activity that has generated material prosperity for many, but not for all. The prevailing approach to economic expansion is beginning to undermine the local and global ecosystems on which human health and well-being depend. The speed of global change can compound these challenges, but can also present opportunities to address them. At SecondMuse, we want to disrupt the prevailing system in a positive way by seeking out these opportunities in order to create a more just and equitable world. We believe in the oneness of humanity. As such, we actively promote the equality of all people and work towards the elimination of all forms of prejudice. We believe that all humans should have a life of dignity, beauty and abundance. We also believe that collective prosperity begins with authentic and organic connections. Inclusion: Human beings are born with the tools to do good and work together, so we take a human-centered approach to problem-solving. That means understanding that all humans, regardless of race, creed, gender, socio-economic status or nationality can make change happen. They must not only be heard, but sought out. Working together makes us stronger. Empathy: We are empathetic to those we try to help and listen with fresh ears to their stories. We then ask questions in order learn and understand. Attempting to change the world isn't easy, but the struggle to do so can bring out the best in people; their compassion, their strength, their intelligence and their joy. When we harness that human energy, we can indeed change the world together. Movement Creation: We define and convene changemakers and then create movements. We empower people to discover and mobilize around their shared ideas together. In this way, we give authentic people and ideas the space they need to inspire one another and perhaps become something that we may not have planned for them. Emerging Technology: As we build engagements and movements around our work, we turn to the power of big data and immersive media to create connections and intimate bridges between otherwise disconnected human experiences. Corporations and governments are turning to big data to improve the quality of life for their citizens and customers, as well as improving environmental conditions, public health, public service delivery and citizen engagement. Cutting-edge technologies, like virtual and augmented reality, are the kind of breakthrough innovations that will disrupt business as we know it. Thanks to social media and crowdsourcing storytelling campaigns, we can share stories across borders and invite people to look for a part of themselves in us, around the digital sphere. In this way, we create spaces for people to find their collective voice, and the resources for it to manifest into something great. At SecondMuse, we believe human beings possess intrinsic capacities for altruism and collaboration. Rather than focusing on just a small part of a larger problem, we look to systemic solutions, ways to fix not only one minor obstacle, but to alter the trajectory of the global infrastructure. We need big solutions for big problems. Tackling such a large task is daunting, but there are steps we can take to make our goals attainable. First we need to break down the organizational silos that so often inhibit progress. We do that by collaborating, creating a space for open dialogue, and encouraging universal participation. We must be honest and clear in all our interactions - with our partners, with the communities with which we work, and most important, with each other. We must be empathetic and see the world from other points of view, rather than just our own. We need to engage with people affected by global change and understand how their stories relate to the problems we are trying to solve. That requires listening to them, really listening without any preconceived notions and then asking questions that help us more deeply understand their environment and how their individual stories relate to the larger problems. That way, we possess a willingness to learn and understand. Finally, we need to create an environment where experimentation and creativity can flourish and touch all around us. We need to build the capacity to collaborate and innovate in all our partners, and in every step of our work.

The BOLT X is designed to enable a significant overclocking potential of components even in a space-constrained form-factor, and it should benefit those who need to have maximum performance in a minimum footprint. Over the past few years we have observed the culmination of several separate trends: compact computers with liquid cooling, with style and with serious overclocking capabilities. The new BOLT X from Digital Storm is the company’s next-generation SFF PC with a HydroLux LCS that features a number of upgrades aimed to advance its cooling performance  as well as improve the system in general. First off, the BOLT X has two 140-mm top mounted fans (up from two 120-mm fans in case of the BOLT 3, the predecessor). Second, it comes with an integrated stand that helps to minimize the amount of dust it sucks in through openings for cool air on the bottom. Third, it features a simplified open layout to make it easier to upgrade and service the PC. Just like the predecessors, the Digital Storm BOLT X can accommodate a Mini-ITX motherboard and one graphics card located beneath the mainboard to ensure proper cooling and compatibility with custom cards that have tall PCBs. With the BOLT X, Digital Storm will offer the Intel Z270-based platforms (so, they will support technologies like NVMe, Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2, 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, etc.) along with various Intel Core processors powered by the Kaby Lake microarchitecture. As for GPUs, expect the PC maker to offer the latest graphics cards that will be available with its BOLT X — NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 10-series for now and whatever comes up next. At present, Digital Storm does not discuss the exact number of SSDs/HDDs that can be housed by the BOLT X chassis, but the PC will definitely support one high-performance M.2 SSD with a PCIe 3.0 x4 interface on the motherboard as well as a number of storage devices in a 2.5-inch form-factor. Following the latest trends, the boutique PC maker eliminated the ODD from the chassis completely, resulting in a perfectly flat front surface. One of the intrigues of the new BOLT X system is its PSU. In theory, Digital Storm can install almost any SFX power supply inside (except, perhaps, the SFX-L versions) to improve overclocking potential and/or support power hungry components. However, with the BOLT 3 the company only offers 400 W PSUs. Digital Storm will start selling BOLT X systems in the first quarter. Exact pricing will depend on actual configuration and will thus vary. At present, the company offers BOLT 3 systems starting at $1906, so the new versions are likely to start at approximately the same price-point.

Back to the drawing board for this one. Reply ddriver - Sunday, January 15, 2017 - link They could at least make it even thinner, being water-cooled and all. Then you could just hang it on the wall and don't worry about knocking it over and breaking it. From the looks of it, much is currently wasted space. If they have a custom psu in there they could have scrapped the casing so it doesn't add bulk. Then the whole unit could be like 2 inches thick.

Still, one of Thursday’s headlines: “Can the Rift Between Trump and the Intel Community Be Healed?” Nation31 people Trump may pick, has picked for Cabinet, top jobs Which seems to imply that this is a group of constituents seeking a voice in government, rather than government itself under the executive himself. advertisement | advertise on newsday Call it a profession, maybe. But a community? Practically, we’re talking about some 17 agencies with military forces, information-technology contractors and surveillance capabilities we might not even know about. Calling it a community also glosses over the bureaucratic tensions that form part of the Washington landscape. Much has been made in the past of behind-the-scenes rivalries between the FBI and CIA, between the NSA and the CIA. When James Mattis sat before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing as defense secretary, he professed a “close relationship with the intelligence community” during his long military career. NationTrump's noteworthy tweets as president-elect The catchphrase serves a purpose. It softens edges. It implies a natural, consensual effort — and obscures the fact that we know different presidents will believe different advice and order research into different questions. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Largely, this “community” will have no choice but to be at Trump’s full disposal by next week and out of President Barack Obama’s hands. Then it will be Trump’s turn to deal as he wishes with unnamed officials he publicly taunted over the Russia controversy. And that isn’t the only weird phrasing of the season. Testifying Thursday at his confirmation hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) was asked about his independence. NationThe most controversial quotes from Trump's campaign “You have my commitment that every day I will speak truth to power,” Pompeo said. advertisement | advertise on newsday So here was a right-leaning Republican and designated CIA director using a phrase coined by the Quakers in 1955 with a pamphlet called: “Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence.” It promoted pacifism, in the belief that love trumps hate.

Consoles by Sean Hollister January 13, 2017 1:00 PM PST @starfire2258 Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS We get our hands on Nintendo's transforming Switch console It's a home console, it's a tabletop gaming system and it's a portable games tablet. It's the Nintendo Switch and after months of waiting, we've finally taken it for a spin. by Andrew Hoyle 1:21 Close Drag 2016 was supposed to be the year modular gadgets caught on. Phones like Google's Project Ara, the LG G5 and the Moto Z promised to let you upgrade your phone just by snapping on new parts. Intel's Thunderbolt 3 port paved the way to turn a thin laptop into a beefy gaming PC just by plugging in an external graphics dock. But several companies have already abandoned or scaled back their modular plans, assuming that we don't actually want what they have to sell. Project Ara was axed, with key team members migrating to Facebook. LG has given up on modular phones entirely, telling CNET that customers (and cellular carriers) weren't interested in the idea. And no one has yet built an inexpensive, broadly compatible external graphics dock for Thunderbolt-equipped laptops. (Motorola appears to be full steam ahead on Moto Mods, promising 12 new snap-on accessories per year, but a leak suggests that the company's upcoming Moto X may not include the feature.) Enlarge Image Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers slide right into the Switch console, and maybe other devices will do the same down the road.Photo by GIF by Sean Hollister/CNET What does any of this have to do with the new Nintendo Switch? It could be the last, best chance to prove people actually do want modular gadgets -- or the final nail in their coffin. The Nintendo Switch is a portable gaming system that uses modular parts to transform. Snap on a pair of controllers and pick it up like a gamepad, or snap 'em off to use as wireless motion controllers. Drop the tablet into a dock to connect it to your TV like a full game console, and snap the two tiny controllers together into a bigger gamepad that charges their batteries at the same time. Cool, no? While that may sound like a bold new idea, it's actually a lot like Nvidia's Shield tablet from 2014, or the Razer Edge tablet from 2013, each of which let you buy an optional gamepad, dock and cables so you could use them with a TV as well. Here's the key difference: The Nintendo Switch comes with everything you need in the box. Enlarge Image Here's everything you'll get in the box.Photo by Nintendo Unlike most modular gadgets (including every single one I mention above), you don't need to buy the parts separately. For $300, £280 or AU$470, it comes with everything you need to transform the Switch into each of its modes. It's the smartest thing Nintendo could have done, and a little surprising considering Nintendo is the company that stopped including power adapters with its latest handhelds. Including everything means Nintendo doesn't have to worry about whether you'll actually buy any of the modular pieces, decide how to market them or stock them on shelves. (You'll only need to buy replacements or extras for friends.) It means game developers can create games for the Switch without worrying about whether you'll be able to transform it into the right mode -- unlike software for, say, the old Wii Balance Board (which came with Wii Fit) or MotionPlus peripherals. 14 A closer look at the Nintendo Switch Heck, it might even mean accessory developers can build intriguing modular accessories for the Switch, knowing owners are already familiar with swapping on and off pieces of their console. It also can't hurt that the Switch is a Nintendo product, which (unlike pretty much every other modular product I've mentioned) will be widely known and recognized around the world. It's pretty much the perfect ambassador for modular gadgets. But that's a double-edged sword: if the Switch fails, it'll be held up as the ultimate example of how people don't want gadgets with pieces that pop off. If Nintendo doesn't make make modular work with the Switch, I doubt anyone will.

The PC version will get Epic Gun Game in the future. If you’re planning on playing Multiplayer this weekend, Infinity Ward has activated Double XP on all platforms until Monday, January 16 at 10am PT/1pm ET. Addressing concerns over the recent Quartermaster update, which added a ton of new content and potentially lowered content chances in supply drops, Infinity Ward said: Since the latest update… Players have the same chance to get a weapon out of a supply drop as they did before. Players have the same chance of getting a rare, legendary, or epic out of a supply drop as they did before. The player’s chance of getting a specific weapon from a supply drop was not demonstratively affected addition of MkII weapons. The addition of all this new content means fewer duplicates from supply drops. We understand that some players are concerned about how this affects their ability to earn salvage. Rest assured, we have plans, and are working on additional plans, to introduce new ways to earn salvage in the future. Infinity Ward also revealed that the January 31 patch for Infinite Warfare will update the camo quality. It will likely include support for the Sabotage expansion pack as well.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Erik Wemple January 13 Follow @ErikWemple Donald Trump at a campaign rally at the University of Northern Colorado on Oct. 30, 2016, in Greeley, Colo. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) In an interview on the “Today” show, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Donald Trump, sounded very pleased with the reporting of NBC News. Like anyone in Trumpworld this week, Conway was attempting to delegitimize the now-famous dossier regarding Trump and Russia that has been circulating in government and media circles. Those who click on BuzzFeed links know it contains some dramatic allegations about the president-elect’s activities. And in her talk with Matt Lauer, Conway focused on establishing distance between her boss and this document: “Really, it was NBC News who broke the story yesterday — so, good for you — that it says on your website that Donald Trump was not briefed on this intelligence matter,” said Conway. At issue is a much-discussed briefing last Friday in New York including Trump and U.S. intelligence chiefs. The big shots were due to discuss allegations that Russia had hacked into U.S. institutions in an effort to sway the 2016 presidential election. Though the briefing was heavily covered in the media, CNN on Tuesday afternoon shed brand-new light on the proceedings. “Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him,” reads the headline that drove a few frenzied days up and down the I-95 corridor. Under the bylines of Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper and Carl Bernstein, CNN alleged that both President Obama and President-elect Trump had been “presented” with documents including “allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.” Moments after that story landed, BuzzFeed went ahead and published the dossier in full, placing in the public realm allegations that other organizations, including CNN, deemed too unverified to release. President-elect Donald Trump found himself in "familiar territory" addressing reporters at his first news conference since winning the election, calling CNN "fake news" and Buzzfeed a "failing pile of garbage." (The Washington Post) The dossier is the work of a former British intelligence officer who started compiling the information as part of an opposition research project first for GOP groups opposing Trump and later for Democratic interests. The CNN reporting team noted that “US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.” CNN, furthermore, was initially silent on the question of whether the intelligence briefing verbally addressed the information, which came in the form of a two-page synopsis of the dossier and was appended to the intelligence community’s larger report on Russian electoral interference. “CNN has confirmed that the synopsis was included in the documents that were presented to Mr. Trump but cannot confirm if it was discussed in his meeting with the intelligence chiefs,” notes the article. On Wednesday morning, Cynthia McFadden of NBC News presented some new reporting on the matter. “What we know is that a senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the preparation for the meeting tells NBC that the president-elect was not briefed on this so-called two-page addendum of these allegations against him — that it was part of the briefing materials available to the briefers,” said McFadden on MSNBC, summarizing some reporting in an online story titled “Trump Wasn’t Told About Russia Memo During Briefing, Official Says.” “But it was not included because they believed it to be true. It was included for a different reason. It was included — should they feel they needed to explain to Mr. Trump the difference between analyzed intelligence and what they’re calling ‘unvetted disinformation.’ That it was available for that purpose and it never came up. Importantly, documents were never presented to Mr. Trump or his team.” More: “This was an oral briefing … and we are told definitively that this was not told to Mr. Trump at the time.” “Unvetted disinformation,” huh? No wonder Team Trump so adored the NBC News reporting. By one definition, “disinformation” means “false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.” An on-the-record statement from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. quite pointedly shied away from endorsing or dissing the synopsis: “The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions,” reads the statement in part. Here’s how the New York Times framed the intelligence community’s decision to include the synopsis: “The material was not corroborated, and The New York Times has not been able to confirm the claims,” notes the newspaper’s story on the matter. “But intelligence agencies considered it so potentially explosive that they decided Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders needed to be told about it and informed that the agencies were actively investigating it.” And the Wall Street Journal reported that the “allegations were deemed sufficiently significant by senior intelligence officials to summarize them in a two-page addendum” and that those officials felt that the president-elect should be apprised of them. So, does NBC News stand by the notion that the synopsis was included as a display of “unvetted disinformation”? The company declined to comment on the record for this story. Now to the question of whether Trump was briefed on the synopsis last Friday. On television Wednesday morning, McFadden said he wasn’t; the online story said that Trump was “not told about unverified reports that Russia has compromising information on him during last week’s intelligence briefing.” On the Wednesday night edition of “NBC Nightly News,” correspondent Hallie Jackson said, “A senior intelligence official with knowledge of the document tells NBC News Trump was never briefed about it.” Here’s a screenshot from from that edition of NBC News’s flagship program: Reince Priebus, the incoming Trump chief of staff, told the “Today” show that he’d attended the intelligence briefing, yet the first he heard of the dossier was when BuzzFeed published it. Last evening, however, CNN reported that Trump and FBI Director James B. Comey had a “brief one-on-one conversation at Friday’s intelligence briefing.” It was FBI Director Comey in a one on one who briefed PEOTUS Trump on that synopsis, we can now report. More here –> pic.twitter.com/hklsmquhEF — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 12, 2017 As it turns out, then, he was told about the matter. So did NBC News get it wrong? Not by its own account. “FBI’s Comey Told Trump About Russia Dossier After Intel Briefing,” reads the headline on an NBC News story from last night. Bolding added to display the most important word in the headline. To draw this critical distinction, the NBC News online report notes, “As NBC News has previously reported, Trump was not told about the contents of the dossier during the formal briefing.” Come on, NBC News! No one out there in newsland is drawing distinctions between some “formal” briefing and a one-on-one session that occurs in the same setting. Certainly Kellyanne Conway drew no such distinctions when she tweeted: From @nbc: Trump wasn't told about unverified Russia dossier, official says. Will TV anchors/networks correct story? https://t.co/kCPRsFu3vf — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2017 @sethmeyers @latenightseth it was FUN…& superFUN to have @NBCNews today agree/verify that Trump was NOT briefed on 2 pages. Hugs to baby! https://t.co/0mQEY5fiLz — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) January 11, 2017 A rule for the next four years: When the Trump people are touting your reporting, worry. CNN’s Tapper told the Erik Wemple Blog in a statement: “We were always confident in our reporting, multi-sourced, diligently and carefully told, and then matched by respected journalists at places such as the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal. Sure, some others relied on sources who turned out to be wrong, and they got burned, and that’s embarrassing for them. For us, we’re going to keep doing our jobs.” Update: An NBC News spokesperson has responded with the following statement: “NBC News has been precise and accurate in our reporting every step of the way, at a time when precision and accuracy are at a premium.” opinions erik-wemple Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

But Casey Michel at The Daily Beast notes that “the past 18 months have seen a noted spike in information warfare” from Moscow “aimed at gulling the Bernie Bros and Occupy-besotted alternative-media set.” Green Party candidate Jill Stein, for example, was “feted” by the Kremlin at a December 2015 gala, where she unveiled a “pro-Putin stance.” Even today, “it remains unclear who paid for Stein’s trip to Moscow and her accommodations there.” Meanwhile, “The Nation’s [pro-Putin] coverage of Russian affairs is a national embarrassment.” Indeed, “Putin has cultivated dupes, fellow travelers and purblind fools among plenty of American progressives.” Mideast expert: The Man Kerry Left Behind John Kerry’s legacy as secretary of state “leans heavily towards failure,” asserts Michael Rubin at Commentary, with “hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced in Syria.” But the man “who should haunt the dreams of Kerry and his team” is former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who remains imprisoned and unheard from in Iran. During negotiations over the nuclear deal, when Kerry’s “leverage was greatest, he did not hold firm to demand Levinson’s return — or information about his ultimate fate.” Nor was his family even notified that when the US paid $1 billion to free five American prisoners. Kerry “made a conscious decision to leave a man behind. That decision represents the worst of the State Department.” Ex-CIA lawyer: Trump’s Right To Want Intel Changes Steven Cash, a former CIA lawyer, says President-elect Trump is right to aim to “dramatically downsize” the office of Director of National Intelligence. Writing in The Washington Post, he says even before 9/11, “there was concern that the structure of the US intelligence community was fundamentally flawed.” Since then, the DNI establishment [has] continued to grow” and a series of directors has “struggled mightily” against this bureaucracy. What we need, Cash says, is what was originally envisioned but went nowhere in Congress: “A slim, trim DNI” with “an admiral to lead a fleet” instead of “a new, ponderous ship and another captain . . . with a fancier uniform.” From the right: What Comey Probe Won’t Focus On The Justice Department inspector general will review FBI Director James Comey’s statements during the campaign regarding Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. While that’s “undoubtedly appropriate,” Andrew McCarthy at National Review says, it’s “worth noting what the IG will not be reviewing: the Justice Department’s conduct.” By which he means DOJ’s decision “not to open a grand-jury investigation, despite significant concrete evidence of criminal wrongdoing,” as well as “the multiple irregular immunity agreements . . . in a case in which no criminal charges were filed.” Nor will the IG look into why DOJ “allowed subjects of the investigation (who had been granted immunity from prosecution) to appear as lawyers for the main subject of the investigation — despite ethical and statutory prohibitions on such conduct.” In other words, “the decisions that actually tanked the Clinton investigation will not be scrutinized.” Political reporter: What Now for Post-Obama Dems? In his farewell, President Obama “made a passionate case” for his policies and civic vision. But Ronald Brownstein at The Atlantic says “his words won’t settle the Democrats’ difficult debate about his political legacy.” Yes, Obama “deepened the Democrats’ connection with a constellation of growing groups” and “a heavily urbanized new coalition.” But he “also narrowed the Democrats’ appeal, both demographically and geographically.” And “as Obama himself has recognized, Democrats cannot cede all that terrain and thrive.” The “one clear message of the Obama years is that Democrats cannot consistently control Congress or most state governments unless they compete better among white voters.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under barack obama ,  donald trump ,  editorial ,  hacking ,  james comey ,  john kerry ,  justice department ,  middle east ,  vladimir putin Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Buzzfeed just did Donald Trump a huge favor Read Next Buzzfeed just did Donald Trump a huge favor Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure Share Selection Columnists George F.

I'm building a PC with the following features: Motherboard: MSI Gaming H270 M3 CPU: Intel I7 7700 Ram: Corsair CMK16GX4M2A2400C16 Case: Fractal Design FD-CA-DEF-R5-BK Define R5 Video Card: Msi GTX 1060 GAMING X 6 GB PSU: Corsair CX650M CP-9020103-EU I ask you for advice. I would like to build a very quiet PC, I do not want to hear when it is working, if not the most of a slight hum when I'm playing. I was thinking about this model for the CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15S According to you may be fine for my configuration? Keep in mind you are not interested in overclocking. Thanks in advance!     Bokka View Public Profile Find all posts by Bokka     (#2) scatman839 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 7970m/970 Mini, KD55XD800 Processor: i7 3610QM/i5 6500 Mainboard: HM77/B150M-C Memory: 12GB D3/16GB D4 Soundcard: Via HD, x-530 PSU: 180w/RM650x 01-12-2017, 22:56 | posts: 12,752 | Location: Scotland If you upgrade to a RM650x then that psu will not spin the fan at all at lower loads, for example, mines never spins I believe, even when maxed out. And the 1060 apparently uses less power than the 970. The 7700k uses 20w more at load, but since a 1060 uses 20w less at load than a 970 I think the RM650x should be a silent psu for you. The gpu you chose will also turn the fan off at <60 degrees C. So the only main thing you need to look at is your cpu cooler and how loud the case fans might be. Also if you use a HDD.

Especially so if you don't remove the roof tiles like I did for the sake of the 240 radiator. I can hear a solid hum all the time probably because of that and the three ordinary HDDs inside the case. If you stick to SSDs only, it would remove significant noise as well, like Scatman said.     Kaarme View Public Profile Find all posts by Kaarme   (#4) Bokka Newbie   Videocard: Nvidia 660 GTX 2Gb Processor: Intel Core i5 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 650W 01-13-2017, 00:12 | posts: 6 The CPU cooler "Noctua NH-D15S" is ok and quiet for my system?

Keep the case fans at 7v and they'll be rather quiet, at 5v they will be inaudible. If you're not that happy with the fans buy yourself some other ones, just google for quiet fans at under 100% speed. Better have more fans spinning lower to save on sound levels than have few case fans that run high rpm. The NH-D15S will be a good cooler, still the most silent thing cooling my old hot i7-950 I've ever tried. If you want to dig into it, I can only recommend silentpcreview.com a very good site that does the most comprehensive sound tests I've seen so far, for stuff like case fans. They're all about silent computing, learned quite a few things there.     fantaskarsef View Public Profile Find all posts by fantaskarsef   (#7) Bokka Newbie   Videocard: Nvidia 660 GTX 2Gb Processor: Intel Core i5 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 650W 01-13-2017, 09:40 | posts: 6 Thanks a lot for the replies!!!     Bokka View Public Profile Find all posts by Bokka   (#8) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-13-2017, 16:27 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA Noctua is way overkill for a 7700.

I have a kfa2 gtx 1050. I have been with her since November. I realized one thing and thought it was something of the Intel stock sink, but it is not. The gpu works with the automatic profile between 55-60% fan speed. The problem is that at 57% it generates a buzz or vibration. While at 58% up that sound disappears. The graph is fairly quiet less when it is at 57%, which is noisier even than at 65% fan speed. How can i fix this?. Is it reason to just make noise in that range of rms?     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31     (#2) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-12-2017, 21:33 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA Force the specific fan speed via MSI AB and try to isolate the buzzing location? If it's the plastic rattling on the heatsink, you could put some double sided tape under it to dampen the noise. I had such an issue on a 780ti evga cooler.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#3) elpollodiablo31 Newbie   Videocard: None Processor: none Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Antec earthwatts 550w 01-12-2017, 21:36 | posts: 17 As I said I isolated the problem and it just happens at 57% fan speed. The problem is that the automatic fan runs between 55-60% in demanding games. So the noise if I do not set it manually is a little annoying. When that happens, I manually stopped the fan with my finger and it is not listening at all. So I do not know because it vibrates just 57%.     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31   (#4) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W 01-12-2017, 21:46 | posts: 8,566 | Location: USA And I'm saying find what it is vibrating on at 57% fan speed. Fan is causing the plastic to rattle against the heatsink somewhere, you have to find out where it's at. The fan itself is most likely not making the noise, the resonance from it is causing the plastic to rattle somewhere. If you do not want to fix it, the only solution is to RMA it or run it at a constant speed. MSI AB will apply at startup so you do not have to set it manually every time.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01     (#5) elpollodiablo31 Newbie   Videocard: None Processor: none Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Antec earthwatts 550w 01-13-2017, 00:49 | posts: 17 I have looked more deeply. The noise is produced by the fan itself. I checked the casing and I do not see that the fault is from there (vibrations). But if I leave the tower horizontal doesn´t sound wrong. It only does when the tower is upright as most have a pc. The noise is of the bearing of the fan I think and it only does it to the 57% of rpm being in vertical.     elpollodiablo31 View Public Profile Find all posts by elpollodiablo31   (#6) HeavyHemi Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SC/TITAN SC PhysX Processor: i7 6850K 4.5 Ghz 1.34 v Mainboard: EVGA X99 FTWK Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32G Soundcard: Asus Xonar Phoebus PSU: CORSAIR AX1200 01-13-2017, 04:20 | posts: 4,860 | Location: Wooing whilst wearing only socks.

Then I guess your solution is to use a program like AfterBurner to keep it out of the range that vibrates...until you replace the GPU.     HeavyHemi View Public Profile Find all posts by HeavyHemi « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Then mid-January rolls along and most of us begin to relax our standards and watch those resolutions go out the window. We start doing creative searches for clever resolutions that we know we can keep and will make our lives easier. We'll dig up studies to prove that chocolate makes us smarter or that we should sleep on the job. Instead of focusing on the new year's resolutions you need to keep, think of the ones you can--and should--break. After all, 80 percent of resolutions are broken by February. Why not make sure they're the right ones? 1. Don't Be Nervous Speakers often tell themselves not to get nervous. Easier said than done. Year after year speakers resolve to simply calm down before a big talk. It's definitely a worthy objective, but there's a reason you shouldn't hold yourself to it. Why You Should Break It: Stage fright comes from our bodies' natural response to threat reaction called fight or flight. Unfortunately, stage fright is unavoidable. There's simply no way to overcome millions of years of survival instinct. But here's the good news: You can break your resolution to calm down and resolve to get pumped up. The best speakers channel the adrenaline produced by their stage fright to get excited. Re-framing anxiety as excitement has been proven to drastically reduce stage fright and speech anxiety. 2. Be Relaxed Everyone aspires to be cool, calm and collected when they walk on stage. Relaxation leads to ease and connection which lets us communicate more effectively. So why shouldn't you aim for zen when you face the audience? Why You Should Break It: Telling yourself to relax is about as effective as telling yourself to imagine the audience naked--it simply doesn't work. Instead, arm yourself with some relaxation power tools in the form of pre-presentation warm ups. Every seasoned actor and athlete can speak to the power of warming up before a performance. This year, break the resolution to chill out and resolve to warm-up. Taking these simple steps to mentally and physically prepare your speaking instrument before your next big talk will make you appear grounded, centered and cool as a cucumber. 3. Be Funny Speakers often resolve to channel their inner life-of-the-party and come across as more humorous and loose. And who could blame them? We all know that humor is good for business. If this is true, then why should you drop the funny-business this year? Why You Should Break It: Instead of trying to be funny or memorizing a few jokes (please, just don't), try using storytelling techniques. An engaging story is the best way to connect with your audience and let your authentic speaking persona shine through. People identify with people, not one-liners. Work on adding compelling and engaging stories that amplify the message of your talk in place of a hackneyed comedy act. By the end of your speech, you may not be the king of comedy, but you'll avoid being a punch line. Feel no guilt in breaking these three public speaking false words of wisdom in the new year and ensure your presentations go from blank stares to standing ovations. If nothing else, resolve to believe you belong on the stage. That's one resolution we should all keep. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this AllSeen's merger with OCF brings IoT closer to common ground ZigBee's Dotdot language aims for IoT harmony Bluetooth 5 is out: Now will home IoT take off? Video Smart Cities: Barcelona A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

G. Dan Hutechson, VLSI Research “450 is probably dead for another five to 10 years,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, a veteran semiconductor equipment analyst who is chairman and CEO of VLSI Research Inc. “It may come back, depending on whether there can be consensus among semiconductor equipment companies.” The Global 450 Consortium (G450C)--a joint R&D program that involved Intel, TSMC, Globalfoundries, IBM, Samsung, the SUNY Polytechnic Institute--quietly wound down its work at the end of last year with member companies concluding that the timing was not right for an optional Phase 2. “All the partners agreed that it’s not the right time to continue to focus on 450,” said Paul Kelly, associate vice president for consortia and initiatives at SUNY Poly, in an interview with EE Times. “But everyone walked away saying that the G450 program itself was a success.” At the recent Industry Strategy Symposium from semiconductor equipment and materials trade group SEMI, barely a whisper was heard about 450mm wafers. A few years ago, major chip makers including the G450 members were pushing for 450mm equipment to be available to equip fabs as soon as next year. But, according to Hutcheson, a major hurdle to the movement has been chip equipment makers, still smarting from the transition to 300mm in the early 2000s. He said the push to larger wafers at that time dramatically reduced unit demand, hurting the equipment makers’ businesses. “The equipment companies generally don’t want [450mm] after what happened with 300mm,” Hutcheson said. Hutcheson added that the initial push for 450mm came from a belief that chip makers needed an alternative way to increase sales if the industry could no longer keep on pace with Moore’s Law. But, Moore’s Law “clearly has not ended,” Hutcheson said. “What happened is that the shrinks have slowed down the growth of the silicon.” Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Nothing certain for 7nm and after resistion   1/15/2017 6:17:56 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I used "to/beyond 7nm" instead of "to 7nm and beyond" hoping to get around the definition variability.

Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

Credit: Kena Betancur/Getty By Tim Dickinson 2 days ago More News Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards: 'We Will Not Go Without a Fight' Van Jones: Only a 'Love Army' Will Conquer Trump Weeks Before Trump Takes Office, the Pain Is Getting Real All Stories Donald Trump is riding into office on a make-believe mandate: Despite a possible assist from Vladimir Putin, Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, and he's taking command of the Oval Office with the lowest favorability rating in modern memory: 37 percent. "A normal politician would be chastened by that," says John Weaver, a leading Republican Trump critic, who advised Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential bid. "But the rules don't apply to him." Trump's surprise victory, Weaver says, "emboldened him somehow." Related ACLU Head on Bracing for Trump and 'Enormous Civil Liberties Crisis' Anthony Romero discusses his group's plan to limit the damage of a president who's openly hostile to essential liberties To put government power behind his darkest campaign rhetoric, Trump has assembled an extreme team – a crew that includes proud Islamophobes, heroes to white supremacists, defenders of torture, and executives from ExxonMobil and Wall Street. "What he's going to do at a policy level is much worse than most liberals understand," says Van Jones, the executive director of the Dream Corps and a CNN contributor. "It's going to be a Blitzkrieg from above – against everything we care about." The Trump agenda threatens the welfare of women, immigrants, LGBTQ Americans and, through climate denial, the health of the planet itself. "You're talking about the rights and lives of millions of Americans at stake," says Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU. But even as the 45th president takes the oath of office, a fierce resistance is rising to confront and constrain the Trump presidency. From the ACLU to the Sierra Club to Everytown for Gun Safety, civil society is girding for battle – reinforced by an unprecedented upwelling of activist support and donations. With so many groups facing "unprecedented assaults," says Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, the progressive world is experiencing a moment of "enormous solidarity – our issues and, frankly, our activists are all connected." Progressives are joined from day one by allies on the right, including principled #NeverTrump Republicans and the rising conservative opposition leader Evan McMullin, who countered Trump as an independent candidate for president. "Trump will blur the line between the right and left," McMullin tells Rolling Stone. "You'll find constitutional conservatives working with people on the left to stand up for civil liberty and stand up for equality – our shared future prosperity depends upon them." Rolling Stone interviewed more than a dozen top leaders of the Trump resistance. Beyond direct action and street protest, five clear opposition strategies are emerging. First, leverage Trump's unpopularity and fragile governing coalition to defeat him outright. "He's going to overreach dramatically, and we have to be prepared to deal him a significant setback," says Weaver. Second, where Trump cannot be stopped, constrain his ambition by bleeding his political capital – "raise the cost of Trump radicalism," says Frank Sharry a top immigrant-rights advocate. Third, blunt Trump's impact with political resistance in the blue states – and even the blue cities in red states – where Trump's agenda remains anathema. Fourth, get out of a defensive crouch: "The best defense is a good offense," says Sierra Club Director Michael Brune. Fifth, when in doubt, sue. "Much of what President Trump is proposing is flat-out illegal," says Romero, whose ACLU has labeled Trump a "one-man constitutional crisis." Squaring off against an aspiring autocrat may come at a high cost: "We need to be concerned about the use of surveillance power to go after critics," warns a prominent rights leader. And successful resistance will depend on creating at-times uncomfortable alliances. But the earliest returns are promising: "This is a progressive coalition and a grassroots army that I have never seen more unified," says Chad Griffin, head of the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ Americans, "or more determined to fight back." Immigration Some in the Trump resistance are putting on a brave face; those who advocate for immigrant rights are bracing for dark days. Trump has vowed a campaign of mass deportation – inspired by the racist and deadly Eisenhower-era program known as Operation Wetback. "Trump has been dehumanizing immigrants from day one of his candidacy," says Sharry, the longtime former director of the National Immigration Forum who now heads America's Voice, a leading immigrant advocacy group. "We would be foolish to engage in wishful thinking that he's going to moderate his course." What makes Trump so dangerous is that "the executive branch has wide latitude" on immigration, Sharry says. "There's a lot a Trump administration can do that's going to be difficult to stop in the courts and in Congress." As a result, immigrant-rights activists are calling for a movement to harbor and protect those without legal status – in terms that evoke the French resistance. "It's going to take unprecedented societal mobilization to thwart the deportation machinery," Sharry says, "from people who are prepared to commit acts of civil disobedience to protect people." To start, Trump has vowed to round up, deport or imprison as many as three million "criminal" undocumented immigrants. "That scale of deportation would be unprecedented in American history," says the ACLU's Romero. Trump's ambition is disconnected from reality. "There's nowhere near three million 'bad hombres' in America," says Sharry. Only by counting common status violations – like driving without a license – as crimes can you get Trump's totals. "We expect them to stretch the definition of 'criminal' to anyone who is in the country without status," Sharry says. "That puts 11 million people at risk." Kevork Djansezian/Getty Among the most vulnerable: 740,000 young immigrants – so-called DREAMers – brought to the country as children, who registered with the Obama administration to gain legal status and employment rights under a program called DACA. Trump has vowed to revoke this "executive amnesty" on day one. At the political level, immigrant-rights activists are going "to try to make DACA a huge fight – bloody enough that it comes with a cost," Sharry says. America's cities have emerged as centers of resistance to Trump's deportation plans. Dozens of mayors from New York to Santa Fe to Seattle have vowed to preserve "sanctuary cities" – which refuse to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement – despite threats to revoke millions in federal funding. The reality is that undocumented immigrants are more popular in America's cities than is the president. "These mayors are not getting out in front of public opinion," Sharry says, "but reflecting it." The Environment Trump's flamboyant climate denial and disgust for environmental regulation – calling global warming a "hoax" and vowing to leave only "tidbits" of environmental protection intact – are now becoming federal policy. Trump has nominated climate denier and fracking champion Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, an agency Pruitt sued repeatedly as attorney general of Oklahoma, including to block Obama's carbon-reducing Clean Power Plan. Pruitt used his nomination announcement to attack the agency he hopes to lead for its "out-of-control anti-energy agenda" that he claimed, without evidence, "has destroyed millions of jobs." For energy secretary, Trump has nominated former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has blasted climate change as a "contrived phony mess." Trump is counting on Perry to "take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits." In what 350.org founder Bill McKibben calls "the most farcical chapter in the absurdist drama that is the Trump transition," Trump has tapped as secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who was until recently CEO of ExxonMobil and who would preside over a petro-driven foreign policy and likely greenlight the Keystone XL pipeline. Environmentalists don't sugarcoat the dangers. But they're far from despondent – more like defiant. "We're not going to cower for the next four years," says Michael Brune of the Sierra Club. "We're going to fight like dogs – in court, in the court of public opinion, in the street and in corporate boardrooms. We'll hold this administration accountable to the law," he vows, "and the expectation of the American public." Environmentalists are keeping chins up, in part, because the market has their backs. Wind and solar increasingly beat fossil fuels on cost alone. "Trump and Tillerson can't stop that," says Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace. Consider that Obama's Clean Power Plan is stalled in the courts, and likely dead under Trump, but national power plant emissions have already been slashed to meet the Obama goal for 2024. Climate activists in New York City Michael Nigro/ZUMA When it comes to Trump's darker aims – rolling back core environmental regulations – environmentalists believe time and public opinion will be on their side. "Trump can't move at the stroke of a pen to undo anything that he wants," says Jeremy Symons, vice president of climate political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. Reversing regulations requires months of public comment and is subject to court challenge. "Time is our ally, because once the public sees overreach there will be a backlash," says Symons. "Outside of special-interest lobbyists in Washington, nobody wants to move backwards." Powerful and diverse business interests are already pressuring Trump to reconsider his climate denial. In November, more than 300 companies – including DuPont, Intel and General Mills – signed an open letter to Trump warning that his threat to abandon the Paris climate accord "puts American prosperity at risk." Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire CEO and former New York mayor, has called on the 128 U.S. leaders in the Global Covenant of Mayors to join the Paris accord in place of the federal government if Trump withdraws. And California is forging ahead with global leadership: "Whatever they do in Washington ... we will persevere," Gov. Jerry Brown told a gathering of climate scientists in December, declaring that if Trump acts to shutter NASA's climate program, California will launch "its own damn satellite." At the grassroots level, climate activists are plotting to disrupt the Trump administration's bid to ramp up coal, oil and natural gas extraction with direct-action protests – like the ones that shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline and stalled Keystone XL. "There's a bigger appetite for direct action because conventional doors to democratic participation appear to be shutting on us," Leonard of Greenpeace tells Rolling Stone. "We have been flooded with requests from other organizations to come to our direct action trainings – learning these skills. We are entering the age of resistance." Women's Rights Anchored by a vice president who has vowed to relegate Roe v. Wade to the "dustbin of history," the Trump administration is openly hostile to women's health and reproductive freedoms. Trump will appoint only pro-life judges, he's said, with the aim of allowing individual states to ban abortion – forcing women to "go to another state." Trump is now in position to sign legislation defunding Planned Parenthood and to revoke the executive order that requires health insurers to cover birth control – a benefit to 55 million American women. Trump could also reinstate the global "gag rule" that blocks U.S. funding for aid groups that provide – or even discuss – abortion services. "We are preparing as though the Trump administration is going to do everything within its executive power" to attack reproductive rights, says Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL. And the movement is bracing for the worst-case-scenario: a Trump-stacked Supreme Court that overturns Roe. NARAL is focused on creating "asylum zones" in cities and states where women can be confident of accessing reproductive services, and, says Hogue, to "mobilize resources so that as many women as possible can get to those safe zones in the event abortion services disappear entirely from other states." An April rally for women's rights in Indiana Jeremy Hogan/Alamy Resistance to the Trump/Pence agenda is beginning with a show of force. On inauguration weekend, the Women's March on Washington will bring hundreds of thousands to the Capitol to "demand protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families." In a mass action on social media, Cecile Richards has launched the largest "I Stand With Planned Parenthood" campaign in the group's history – to "agitate and engage millions" by asking Americans to share "what people are poised to lose if Planned Parenthood is blocked from serving patients." "This is literally whether a woman who has a lump in her breast can come to us in Ohio to have a breast exam," Richards says. "Or whether a young person can come to us for family planning." More than 1.5 million Americans, many of them Medicaid patients, rely on Planned Parenthood, "and for most of them we're their only medical provider; there's no one to take our place." In Texas, where state Republicans have succeeded in shuttering dozens of Planned Parenthood clinics, the maternal death rate has doubled, hitting poor women of color the hardest. "It is a very serious threat," says Richards, "but we will not go without a fight." Guns Trump owes an enormous political debt to his most potent 2016 backer: the NRA, which spent more than $30 million to get him elected. "They want to get what they paid for," says Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, the grassroots arm of Everytown for Gun Safety. The gun lobby's wish list for Trump begins with replacing deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia with another Second-Amendment fundamentalist – a judge who will back a constitutional right to own military-style assault weapons. The NRA is already pushing a new law to allow residents of states with lax concealed-carry laws, like Montana, to pack heat in states with tight restrictions, like Massachusetts. The NRA also expects Trump to follow through with promises to roll back gun-free zones in schools and to revoke President Obama's executive expansion of background checks. Trump with the NRA's Chris Cox and Wayne LaPierre in May Scott Olson/Getty "With the NRA's champion in office," Watts says, "we see ourselves playing a lot of defense." But Watts hopes that Trump's "dangerous" NRA payback will "galvanize Americans to get off the sidelines and say 'no' to this dystopian vision of guns for anyone, anywhere, anytime – no questions asked." Priority number one is building Moms Demand Action as the grassroots counterweight to the five-million-member NRA. Watts began movement-building in 2012, in the wake of the Newtown massacre. Her group now counts chapters in every state and more than three million members. "The more people join the ranks," she says, "the less likely anything is to pass." Watts also sees running room in state capitals and corporate boardrooms – following the playbook of the marriage equality movement during the darkest days of the Bush administration. "We've gotten businesses like Starbucks, Chipotle and Target to stop open-carry inside their stores," she says. "And we got Facebook to halt all private sales of guns." Electorally, Watts and Everytown are focused on passing universal background checks state-by-state, and have that fight in seven states since Sandy Hook, most recently in Nevada in November. "Nearly half of all Americans now live in states that have closed their background-check loophole," Watts says. "These states are doing what Congress won't." LGBTQ Rights President-elect Trump made news in the aftermath of the election by calling marriage equality "settled" law in an interview with 60 Minutes. But top advocates for the LGBTQ community take Trump's words as cold comfort – pointing to the team the president has assembled, full of politicians hostile to LGBTQ rights and eager "to roll back our progress that we've made under President Obama," says Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. The selection of Pence as vice president speaks loudest to Trump's intentions. "He chose a man who has been the face of our opposition his entire life," Griffin says. "Pence was not only against hate crimes protections, he supports conversion therapy and actually advocated revoking HIV funding in order to pay for it." Trump put Pence in charge of the presidential transition. And Pence has entrusted the domestic-policy track to Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council who has called homosexuality a "transgression against God's law" and a "choice" like becoming "an arsonist ... or a kleptomaniac." Ken Blackwell Eduardo Munoz/Getty Trump can reverse Obama's executive orders on LGBTQ rights, including a workplace non-discrimination mandate that protects employees of federal contractors, and a Department of Education order that safeguards trans students. Trump has already endorsed legislation to enshrine "Kim-Davis-style discrimination," Griffin says – allowing people and businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans on the basis of a professed religious objection to same-sex marriage and/or gay sex. But there is political peril in targeting LGBTQ Americans: Just ask North Carolina's former Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who was defeated in November in a revolt against the state's anti-trans bathroom bill. "This is the first time in our history that we have ousted a sitting elected official solely on the issue of attacking our community," Griffin says – a victory made more remarkable because Trump carried North Carolina by more than three points. The LGBTQ community will carry this momentum into fights for trans-inclusive nondiscrimination laws in America's cities, including in the reddest of states. Last year the Human Rights Campaign swept through a non-discrimination law in the capital city of Mississippi. "If we can do it in Jackson," Griffin says, "we can do it anywhere." True Conservatives The election of Donald Trump has been met with quiet horror in many conservative circles. "The Republican Party normalized a lunatic," longtime GOP strategist Stuart Steven wrote to this reporter on election night. "They knew better and refused to stand up – utter disgrace." Many are disgusted that Trump has given racial demagogs a voice in the GOP – and representation in his inner circle. "Gangrene has entered into the body, and either you join in the effort to cut it out – to kill it – or you acquiesce to it," says John Weaver. "We can't stand by and allow racists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, anti-Semites – whatever you want to call them – free reign in the public discourse. They cannot be normalized." Trump also faces resistance from conservatives on policy. "You have people concerned about the national security implications of Trump – his attitude toward Putin, his affection for autocrats, his not understanding the basics of engagement," Weaver says. "Others are more concerned on the civil rights – the basic rights of Americans." The trick, says Weaver, is to build beyond isolated pockets of dissent in the GOP ranks – Sen. John McCain on torture, or Sen. Rand Paul on surveillance. Trump will be countered, Weaver says, "by a web, not by a rifle shot." Evan McMullin George Frey/Getty The right's opposition to Trump remains loose. ("People are dusting the rubble off," says Weaver, "taking stock of really how bad it is.") But it has emerging leadership in Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent and senior GOP House staffer who ran against Trump for president, placing third in Utah. McMullin cites the president's "resolute alignment" with Russia and his "authoritarian playbook" to contend that "Donald Trump is not a loyal American." The elected GOP, he adds, is focused on party power and not the national interest. "I don't have a lot of hope that many of our public officials on the Republican side will stand up any time soon," he says. McMullin is marshaling conservative resistance to Trump and seeking common cause with progressives. He wants to build a movement around the foundational American principles of "equality and liberty" flouted by Trump. And he hopes the left and right can take this moment to learn from each other: with conservatives following the progressive lead on civil liberties for all Americans, and liberals cottoning to the virtues of limited government. "When conservatives say it's really dangerous for us to have this big, centralized government, some on the left might not have understood why," he says. "But with Donald Trump taking the presidency, I think they now understand." Civil Liberties Defense of our democracy in the age of Trump will fall to the courts – and to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that can take legal action against the incoming administration's threatened constitutional abuses. Anthony Romero is bracing for a full-blown "civil liberties crisis" in America under Trump. "The stakes are very high," Romero says, "because the impact on the basic rights of so many Americans hang in the balance – whether they be Muslims or undocumented immigrants or women." Preparing a "wholescale campaign to resist" the new administration, Romero says the ACLU is already honing legal theories, staffing up in states along the Mexican border and reaching out to Muslim communities across America. The ACLU's tactics will draw inspiration from GOP obstructionists. "The strategy that Republicans used so effectively – trying to gum up the machinery of the Obama administration" is the same game plan the ACLU will use, Romero says, "to forestall the ability of the Trump administration to make good on its plans." At times, the ACLU will act preemptively "to hold off the worst of the policies from taking effect." In other moments, it will seek to tie up Trump in court "right as the policies are taking effect – to try to deprive the administration of momentum." NAACP President Cornell Brooks, Fraternal Order of Police National President Chuck Canterbury and ACLU Legal Director David Cole testify during Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing on January 11th. Tasos Katopodis/Getty The group is vigilant – but confident. Many Trump proposals are "flat-out illegal," Romero insists: moving to reinstate torture or waterboarding is "patently unconstitutional and violates international treaties." Trump's threat to jail and revoke the citizenship of flag-burners is "unconstitutional and contrary to established law," Romero says. But with other proposals, he warns, "it's newer terrain." The immigration ban on Muslims, he argues, "would run afoul of the First- and Fifth-Amendment protections of American Muslims" – but those theories will need to be tested in court. Above all, Romero says the ACLU will fight to protect the rights of protesters from a president who has displayed a "complete lack of respect" for them. "If the protestors rights are trammelled, or they're intimidated, or they self-censor," Romero says, "then we're in for even darker days ahead of us." The First Test The first test of the Trump resistance has arrived with the confirmation hearings of the new president's cabinet appointees. Trump's polarizing choices have united diverse coalitions – and strange bedfellows. The nomination of Exxon's Rex Tillerson for secretary of state has raised the hackles of environmentalists – who recoil at the company's long history of climate disinformation – and hawks, who distrust Tillerson's coziness with Russia's Vladimir Putin. "Even the minority of people who voted for Trump weren't voting to turn over the keys [on climate policy] to the head of an oil company," insists 350.org founder Bill McKibben. Tweeting his own skepticism of Tillerson, Sen. Marco Rubio wrote, "Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary Of State." No cabinet pick has united the Trump resistance like Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator tapped to head the Justice Department, where he would have broad autonomy to set the national course on the enforcement of civil rights, drug and immigration policy. Sessions was blocked from Senate confirmation once before, when the body refused to seat him as federal judge in the mid-Eighties, following hearings that detailed a distressing history of racism. As a U.S. attorney, Sessions had prosecuted black voting-rights activists – close associates of Martin Luther King Jr. – on trumped-up accusations of voter fraud. (The activists were found not guilty.) And he's railed against the Voting Rights Act as "intrusive." According to Senate testimony, Sessions repeatedly referred to a black subordinate as "boy" and opined – during an investigation of a Ku Klux Klan lynching – that he'd thought the KKK was "OK until I found out they smoked pot." (Sessions denied denigrating his colleague, and insisted the Klan comment was a joke.) Sessions also called civil rights groups, including the NAACP, "un-American organizations teaching anti-American values." In his U.S. Senate career, Sessions has continued a track record as an extremist. He's an unreconstructed drug warrior – Sessions insisted last year that "good people don't smoke marijuana." An immigration hardliner, Sessions has long ties to the far-right organization FAIR; "he has cavorted with groups that we consider to be hate groups," says Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Members of the Alabama NAACP stage a sit-in at Jeff Sessions' office in Mobile. Benard Simelton Sharry, the immigrant-rights leader, calls the idea of Sessions enforcing civil rights and immigration laws "preposterous." Todd A. Cox, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, says "it is unimaginable that he could be trusted to enforce this nation's civil rights laws." Coretta Scott King warned in a 1986 letter that Sessions' appointment to the judiciary would "irreparably damage the work of my husband." Sessions faces deep resistance from the drug-reform community, concerned Sessions will break the fragile federal Drug War truce that has enabled state-legal marijuana to boom into a $7 billion industry. Sessions is also opposed by conservatives, who fear he will derail bipartisan progress on issues like criminal justice reform. "Sessions illustrates the need for a new conservative movement," McMullin says. Given the deference senators historically show when colleagues are nominated to the cabinet, Sharry predicts "an uphill fight." But just this act of fighting, he says, will forge alliances among "groups who don't always work arm-in-arm." To have any hope of succeeding, the Trump resistance must seek out challenging allies. Responsibility for coalition-building weighs heavily on conservatives. "It's important for the opposition to Trump to be bipartisan," Weaver says. "It plays into his hands – and Steve Bannon's hands – for it to be seen as coming from the far left." For some groups, this means embracing Trump voters themselves. "One of the most heartening, but somewhat perplexing things," says Cecile Richards, "is the number of Trump voters who are deeply concerned now about losing access to Planned Parenthood." Hogue says NARAL will be agitating among Trump voters to tell the new president, "Stop messing with reproductive rights and go back to trying to build infrastructure." The first step for progressives, says Van Jones, is to get over the shock and horror at Trump's victory, and to stop thinking of Trump voters as the enemy, instead seeking common cause with working-class Americans who are already feeling "duped." The coalition required to stop Trump won't always agree, Jones says. The key is not to feed the division that is the president's secret weapon. "Trump desperately needs everybody screaming at each other," Jones says, "so he can get away with his agenda." Like Jones, McMullin sees power in love – and love of country. "If there's a silver lining to any of this is," he says, "it's that people on the right and the left may come together to stand up for foundational truths and decency and unity in America. "It's not easy to have hope right now, but that does give me hope," he says. "We need to stand up together as Americans to make sure that our system is not destroyed."

Sen. Richard Burr, who chairs the select committee, revealed Thursday that they will not look into the ties because they "don't have anything to do with political campaigns," which Pelosi railed against while meeting with the reporters in the Capitol on Friday. "Leader [Mitch] McConnell is saying the [Senate] Intelligence Committee can do that. Meanwhile, the GOP chair of the Senate Intel Committee, Sen. Burr, announced he will not investigate Russia and the campaign in the U.S.," she said. "That makes Republicans accomplices in my view of President-elect Trump's praise of Putin." Pelosi continued to echo Democratic calls for a special investigation into the attempted Russian hacking into the election. The comments came after members of Congress took part in a classified briefing on Russia, which Pelosi declined to elaborate on. She also declined to say if FBI Director James Comey indicated that the FBI is looking into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia.

"You know I can't talk about what happened in the meeting," Pelosi said. "I can just say publicly that the American people are owed the truth, and there is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people, to the strength, the integrity of our own democracy." "For that reason, the FBI should let us know if they're doing that investigation or not," Pelosi continued. "They're usually inscrutable, as you saw in the public testimony in the Senate." Burr said it would be the FBI's job to investigate any ties between the campaign and Moscow.

The OS also has higher operating costs due to increased malware attacks and many manufacturers no longer provide drivers for Windows 7 which means that modern peripherals are no longer working with the OS, the software giant writes. “Windows 10 is the only Windows version to provide support for the latest Intel, AMD and Qualcomm chips. In addition, many programs are already written or developed for newer versions of Windows,” according to a post on the website of Microsoft Germany . “Companies that continue to use the operating system take enormous dangers,” the software giant writes. The company goes on to write that Windows 7 was developed for ‘the wireless 2000’s and that ‘Windows 7 is based on long-outdated security architectures’. In 2020, on January 14th, support for Windows 7 ends which means Microsoft will no longer release security updates for the OS. Basic support ended a year ago meaning that Microsoft stopped adding new functionality to the operating system. “Windows 7 slowly becomes old. It does not meet the requirements of today’s modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments, “said Markus Nitschke, Head of Windows at Microsoft Deutschland. “We learned from Windows XP that companies should take early steps to avoid future risks or costs.” The message from Microsoft appears to try to convince users to update to Windows 10 to avoid the same situation as with Windows XP. This OS is still run by millions of computers, both at home and in companies, while has not received any security updates since 2014. By warning users to switch to a more modern OS on time Microsoft not only want to save them from security risks, it appears to be also an attempt to get more users for its latest OS. Windows 7 is currently by far the most used Windows version globally, according to StatCounter more than 40% is using the OS, while Windows 10 is used by about 28% of the internet users. Users who didn’t take Microsoft’s offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10 can still do so, using Microsoft’s Media Creation Tool.

Maybe there is some truth to that statement. But I can't see any reason to think Windows 10 is any better. If fact it is arguably worse - on installation you are still given Administrator privileges by default, but Microsoft tells you even less than before. 4 Agree AaronZ26593 New Member Posted on: 14 Jan 17 02:18 Desperation started with forced updates lol *Shakes Head* I'm sticking with Win 7 it still works and I don't plan on building a new PC anytime soon. 6 Agree Mary Cahill MyCE Junior Member Posted on: 14 Jan 17 10:28 Yes, my first thought has already been extremely well sized up by the others above - when a company gets a reputation for being under-handed - everything they say after that is suspect - that's why "integrity" is so important for a brand-name to maintain.  Microsoft lost it!  1 Agree paulw2 MyCE Senior Member Posted on: 15 Jan 17 01:11 Sounds like MS is softening us up for an early end for Windows 7 support.. 0 Agree CDan MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Jan 17 04:14 Gosh, lose "support"?

Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years Stephen Lawson (IDG News Service) 14 January, 2017 05:05 - - - - print email Comments A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group. The standard is meant to span all industries plus consumer devices. It wouldn’t replace existing data formats but would reduce the amount of effort required to share data among them. Using what's already finished Some players are offering established technologies as common layers for interoperability. Last week at CES, the ZigBee Alliance announced Dotdot, which it calls a universal language for IoT. It’s an open application layer that handles the same kinds of things as OCF, but it’s based on the upper-layer protocol already implemented in many devices that use the ZigBee wireless network. Dotdot can already work with Thread networks. Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit. But there are still too many choices, for both developers and consumers, to make IoT simple and easy, industry analysts say. That will probably still be true 12 months from now, and maybe for two or three more years, they said. "I don't think we've gotten to the point where consolidation has made the lives of solution providers and application developers much easier,” Machina Research analyst Andy Castonguay said. “You still have a tremendous array of options out there." That’s kept consumer choices fragmented, too, which is one issue holding back smart homes, Avi Greengart at Current Analysis said. Most consumers won’t buy IoT gear until they see clear value, ease of installation, and ease of interoperability, he said. “Every major computing and silicon vendor is competing in this space, and there hasn’t been a consolidation around winners just yet. The market is kind of a mess right now,” Greengart said. Enter the lawyers Why is it so hard to agree on standards? "They're big companies, and they move slowly," said Mike Krell of Moor Insights and Strategy. Standards tend to raise intellectual property issues that bring armies of lawyers into the picture. Even breakthroughs in standards diplomacy aren't guarantees. Just because an impressive list of vendors, including Microsoft, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier belong to OCF, that doesn’t mean they’ll all adopt the organization’s standard across all their products, Krell said. It’s common for big vendors to join many industry groups just to engage with and influence trends. There’s too much at stake in a potentially huge market for major companies to give up the chance to dominate home IoT, Greengart said. “I’m highly skeptical that 'co-opetition' in this regard will prevail over competition. And given than nobody knows what layer of the stack is going to be the most valuable one, everyone is fighting for their own,” he said. The common thread that will make smart homes work may turn out to be a system from one vendor, like Apple’s HomeKit, Greengart said. Apple is as well-positioned as any company to make that happen. But even though many manufacturers at last week’s CES show introduced products that use HomeKit, they didn’t play up that capability much, he said. Alexa, Amazon’s cloud-based AI platform that made a splash at CES, at least provides a single user interface, though Greengart said it’s not really a full IoT platform like HomeKit -- yet. There's even more work to do Even if part of the technology stack is standardized and life gets easier for developers and buyers, there are other hurdles to mass adoption of home IoT. Security, one of consumers’ biggest worries, has to be addressed across the board instead of one component at a time, as it is now, Machina’s Castonguay said. “We still are waiting for the market to develop an approach that would allow for a full, end-to-end, consistently updated and audited security approach,” he said. Then there’s the issue of how consumers will choose to buy IoT products. While most smart homes are do-it-yourself affairs today, carriers and cable companies may become the main sales channel, Krell said. But it’s still too soon to say. Some good news While things may be murky at home, there are glimmers of hope in another part of the internet of things. Last year, the 3GPP, which sets cellular standards, settled on two specifications for low-power versions of LTE. Those technologies, called Category M1 and Category NB1, will lead carriers to roll out specialized IoT services, Castonguay said. Both of the new technologies are slower than regular mobile data service but use less energy, so they’re compatible with small, battery-powered connected objects like sensors. As part of the LTE standard, these systems are relatively easy and economical upgrades to current networks. Another low-power, wide-area networking standard, LoRa, is gaining momentum with more national rollouts, Castonguay said. Comcast announced in October that it’s considering a nationwide LoRa network to serve enterprises. Some carriers in other countries already use the technology. Ingenu, a U.S. company with its own type of low-power network, is also making gains around the world, he said. Wherever IoT does reach mass adoption, it will be thanks to one or two technologies -- open or not -- that have somehow caught on with users. “Sometimes ubiquity is the most important part of a standard,” Greengart said.

Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Some are starting to come together, but it looks like the battles will go on for a few more years Stephen Lawson (IDG News Service) 14 January, 2017 05:05 - - - - print email Comments A few brave souls predict IoT standards will start to gel this year, but making all those connected things work together still looks like a long shot. Two years ago, some industry analysts cautiously suggested that a vast array of IoT standards would merge into just a few beginning in 2017. If the internet of things in late 2014 was a cacophony of discordant musicians tuning up, it’s now reached the point where a few virtuosos are playing the same tune. But there’s still a lot of sheet music getting passed around. Two of the biggest rivals in IoT did find harmony last year. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) was formed out of the AllSeen Alliance -- which used the Qualcomm-developed AllJoyn -- and the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium. Previously, each group had been promoting its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. In another promising sign, the IEEE p2413 standard, which will provide a unified approach to defining IoT architectures, may be finished this year, according to Oleg Logvinov, chairman of the p2413 working group.

Sigma Designs, the main company behind Z-Wave networks, has released the Z-Wave interoperability layer to help developers integrate those networks with applications and services using cloud-based platforms like HomeKit.

SUBSCRIBE Super Bowl LI teaser ads a no show so far this year with brands keeping campaigns under wraps By this time last year, three brands had released teaser ads and three more had shared creative from their Super Bowl campaigns. Amy Gesenhues on January 13, 2017 at 12:30 pm More As of Sunday, we’ll be three weeks out from Super Bowl LI. By this time last year, three brands had already released teaser ads for their Super Bowl campaigns, and three more had shared creative. This year is a different story with the lineup of Super Bowl brands remaining surprisingly quiet. So far, we’ve only seen creative from Intel, which released a 30-second spot starring NFL MVP Tom Brady scheduled to air during the February 5th Super Bowl broadcast. For Super Bowl 50, Butterfinger and Wix both released teaser videos in December of 2015, more than a month before the game. By the second week of January, Turbo Tax had also released teaser ads. Taco Bell and SunTrust Bank didn’t release video ads, but both brands had shared creative from their Super Bowl 50 campaigns. Taco Bell’s ‘redacted’ release for Super Bowl 50 Carla Marshall, the editor in chief of TubularInsights.com, says she believes brands are getting more savvy when it comes to consumer fatigue around large-scale events like the Super Bowl. “We know there is a lot of excitement and anticipation around Super Bowl content, but a long run-up in terms of teasers may have less impact than a big launch a few days before,” says Marshall, “I think this is the year we will see some of the bigger brands take a slightly different approach to try and capture the public’s attention at exactly the right time, and measure the ROI that has.” Devra Prywes, the SVP of Marketing and Insight for video analytics firm Unruly, agrees with Marshall. She says brands may be realizing that Super Bowl teaser ads are not driving the awareness or engagement when compared to their official Super Bowl spots. “In fact, we actually saw something quite interesting happen last year for the first time,” says Prywes, “While main ads outperformed teasers, the extended versions of TV spots often were more shared than the aired versions.” Prywes says this was true for Heinze’s “Weiner Stampede,” T-Mobile’s “Restricted Bling,” the NFL’s “Super Bowl Babies Choir” and Audi’s “Commander.” Data from Unruly’s “Science of Sharing: Super Bowl 50” report found that teaser ads made up nearly 30 percent of the total number of Super Bowl 50 ads that were launched, but only accounted for 10 percent of overall views and two percent of shares. Prywes says for teaser ads to make an impact, they have to make a strong emotional connection – and that can be a challenge with such a short run-time. “Based on our data, teasers tend to be distracting – for splitting budget and attention,” says Prywes, “As even the best ads need to be seen to be shared, it’s more effective to reinvest that budget into distribution to deliver the main ad to a brand’s target audience everywhere these people are already consuming video.” We suspect to see more activity in the coming days. One brand confirmed over email it plans on sharing details around creative for its Super Bowl LI campaign next week.

LEAD Ditch These 3 Resolutions to Become a More Powerful Public Speaker Want to become a more powerful public speaker? Start by breaking these New Year's resolutions--guilt free.

Her unique approach to keynoting utilizes theatrical techniques and performing arts skills in addition to practical, real world knowledge culled from coaching clients at TEDX, UCSD, Qualcomm, Intel and numerous Fortune 500 companies. @moxiespeaker CEO, The MOXiE Institute@moxiespeaker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement At the start of the year, everyone is trying their best to stick to the resolutions they swore that this year they would keep. Then mid-January rolls along and most of us begin to relax our standards and watch those resolutions go out the window. We start doing creative searches for clever resolutions that we know we can keep and will make our lives easier. We'll dig up studies to prove that chocolate makes us smarter or that we should sleep on the job. Instead of focusing on the new year's resolutions you need to keep, think of the ones you can--and should--break. After all, 80 percent of resolutions are broken by February. Why not make sure they're the right ones? 1. Don't Be Nervous Speakers often tell themselves not to get nervous. Easier said than done. Year after year speakers resolve to simply calm down before a big talk. It's definitely a worthy objective, but there's a reason you shouldn't hold yourself to it. Why You Should Break It: Stage fright comes from our bodies' natural response to threat reaction called fight or flight. Unfortunately, stage fright is unavoidable. There's simply no way to overcome millions of years of survival instinct. But here's the good news: You can break your resolution to calm down and resolve to get pumped up. The best speakers channel the adrenaline produced by their stage fright to get excited. Re-framing anxiety as excitement has been proven to drastically reduce stage fright and speech anxiety. 2. Be Relaxed Everyone aspires to be cool, calm and collected when they walk on stage. Relaxation leads to ease and connection which lets us communicate more effectively. So why shouldn't you aim for zen when you face the audience? Why You Should Break It: Telling yourself to relax is about as effective as telling yourself to imagine the audience naked--it simply doesn't work. Instead, arm yourself with some relaxation power tools in the form of pre-presentation warm ups. Every seasoned actor and athlete can speak to the power of warming up before a performance. This year, break the resolution to chill out and resolve to warm-up. Taking these simple steps to mentally and physically prepare your speaking instrument before your next big talk will make you appear grounded, centered and cool as a cucumber. 3. Be Funny Speakers often resolve to channel their inner life-of-the-party and come across as more humorous and loose. And who could blame them? We all know that humor is good for business. If this is true, then why should you drop the funny-business this year? Why You Should Break It: Instead of trying to be funny or memorizing a few jokes (please, just don't), try using storytelling techniques. An engaging story is the best way to connect with your audience and let your authentic speaking persona shine through. People identify with people, not one-liners. Work on adding compelling and engaging stories that amplify the message of your talk in place of a hackneyed comedy act. By the end of your speech, you may not be the king of comedy, but you'll avoid being a punch line. Feel no guilt in breaking these three public speaking false words of wisdom in the new year and ensure your presentations go from blank stares to standing ovations. If nothing else, resolve to believe you belong on the stage. That's one resolution we should all keep. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

The gaming sector benefits the most with AR technology, but the technology now is used in many other fields, like aerospace & defense, education, tourism, retails and e-commerce. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ: VUZI) is a supplier of Smart-Glasses, AR and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and products for the consumer and enterprise markets just announced earlier today that, "the Company has completed, passed, and filed with the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) all of the (FCC) emission's requirements for its next generation M300 Smart Glasses. Vuzix expects to commence shipping of the M300 Smart Glasses to customers in the USA and Canada within days of this filing. With FCC filings now in place and the recent certification for shipments to Europe completed last month, the Company is now positioned for the full commercial launch to its largest initial markets. Other major regions of the world should follow with submissions of their required regulatory filings through the first quarter of 2017, enabling Vuzix to expand its M300 offerings near worldwide. The new Vuzix M300 represents the next generation of smart glasses, designed to address customer feedback from more than three years of productive use of the earlier M100.  This field experience has led to the addition of many empowering, barrier-reducing features such as improved ergonomics, modern security capabilities, enhanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and industry leading video streaming. These improvements are just some of the many that allow the M300 to be a central communications platform to and from a client's remote workforce, connecting their corporate data and IOT field devices in real time to the people in the field who need them. The work over the last six months to establish the Vuzix VIP application software partner program has resulted in a significant pipeline of customer budgeted and approved projects awaiting the arrival of the M300. Vuzix will begin with production M300 shipments to these EU and US VIP partners who have been pre-allocated units for immediate deployment to their existing client base. In addition, we have many orders from customers that have taken advantage of the M100/M300 migration program and/or placed pre-orders for the M300. These order pipelines are significantly greater than when the M100 launched and the Company expects that it will continue to enjoy robust growth in smart glasses revenues, as clients accelerate volume deployments.  "We are now set up to ship the M300 to the hundreds of US customers that represent the beginnings of volume roll outs," said Paul Travers, President and Chief Executive Officer at Vuzix." Cloud infrastructure and business mobility company, VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW) announced the addition of new smart glasses management features to VMware AirWatch®. According to the statement, the update will bring a consistent management platform to streamlined onboarding experiences, network setup and application deployment to organizations seeking to leverage augmented and mixed reality devices to transform business processes. VMware is the first unified endpoint management solution to extend into wearables, enabling customers to manage their smart glasses alongside existing desktop and mobile endpoints. VMware is also working alongside with APX Labs, Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIX Corporation to help provide wearable management and application delivery solutions. American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications, QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) company subsidiary along with developer and manufacturer of mobile head worn computing and augmented reality technologies and products, Osterhout Design Group announced that R-8 and R-9 will be the first announced devices powered by the Qualcomm's Snapdragon™ 835 processor, which uses 10-nanometer FinFET process technology to enable a new generation of premium consumer devices in small form factors with breakthrough performance and superior power efficiency. R-8 is Osterhout Design Group's consumer mobile Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality smartglasses, and R-9 is for a wide variety of wide field-of-view experiences from light enterprise.

So, here’s our recap. What did really stand out this year in the hot robo-car segment? The “human factor” is how we’d sum it up. Gill Pratt The case for human and social factors was stated softly, but there it was. More companies — including Toyota and Mobileye — are scrambling to address the inconvenient truth that robo-cars pose a man-machine relationship more complicated than we care to admit.   At issue is how the human factor alters the future of self-driving designs. Gil Pratt, CEO of Toyota Research Institute, noted, “As wonderful as AI is, AI systems are inevitably flawed…”  Mobileye’s co-founder, CTO and chairman Amnon Shashua, described teaching vehicles to learn human intuition as “the last piece of the autonomous driving puzzle.” This sort of talk marks a shift in thinking, in sharp contrast to the engineering agenda of just a few years ago — which was simply a matter of eliminating the human driver from autonomous car development. Of course, the show’s headlines featured issues far less subtle. They trumpeted partnership agreements among companies like Nvidia, Intel and Mobileye with big auto brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz and Volvo, or with tier ones like Bosch, ZF and Delphi. A slew of tech companies flooded the show floor with their newest lidar, radar and image sensor technologies. Nvidias CEO Jen-Hsun Huang brought Audi of America Head Scott Keogh on the stage to announce the two companies partnership to build the next generation AI cars. Outside the convention center, tier ones like Delphi were busy giving the press rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. NXP Semiconductors, too, gave CES attendees test drives of a highly automated vehicle, allowing them to experience “improved road safety and traffic flow” via DSRC-based V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2I (vehicle to infrastructure) communication. NXP has cooperated with Delphi and Savari for onboard and roadside units, while NXP’s partner Microsoft talked up future scenarios in which artificial intelligence can improve driver safety and analyze traffic situations on its Azure cloud platform. The overall message was clear: Engineers can now make cars drive themselves. But to us, editors at EE Times, the biggest automotive news at this year’s CES broke when Toyota Research Institute’s Pratt, last week took the stage at Toyota’s press conference, and posed a question nobody has dared to ask before on the safety of robo-cars. He asked: “How safe is safe enough?” He noted that people, tolerant of human error, have come to accept the 35,000 traffic deaths every year in the United States. But would they tolerate even half that carnage if it was caused by robotic automobiles? "Emotionally, we don't think so," said Pratt. "People have zero tolerance for deaths caused by a machine." Many engineers in the automotive and tech industries have embraced the prevailing assumption that autonomous cars are much safer than cars driven by human drivers. But how do humans really feel about machines that can drive but can also kill? Add the human factor to the equation, and hard to completely ignore Pratt’s observation or even casually dismiss his statements as too conservative. Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), characterized Pratt’s demonstration at Toyota’s press conference as nothing but “very conservative, the Toyota way.” Magney said, “Honestly, this is very pragmatic for a company like Toyota, as for the next many years there will be lots of cars sold to individual drivers and they will want the added safety and convenience.” Given that it will take decades before robo-cars eventually replace all cars driven by people, it isn’t enough to talk about pushing the first robo-car out on the road in 2021. The conversation is now shifting to a reality in which human-driven cars share the road with robo-cars — not the next few years but over the next few decades.

As Telsa has seen, a significant number of drivers interacting with automated systems (either in their own car or another vehicle) push the limits since the systems are not humans. I have not seen a clear plan for dealing with this natural tendency in discussions of mixed traffic of automated and human drivers. For example, how would an automated car ever make it into a crowded roundabout? Or merge during a traffic jam? A measured amount of human aggression keeps things flowing now. If a driver knows that another car is automated, would they tend to not let them merge? Or cut them off intentionally knowing that the automated car will avoid a collision? In a few cases, I would expect extreme behavior specifically testing the automation. Taking this to the limit, should we build in some apparent risk for other drivers to ensure they behave appropriately around automated cars? i.e. zero-tolerance is counter-productive? Rather than adding physical risk to add negative feedback to the system, we could consider a debit system based on driving behavior. Instead of relying on police monitoring and issuing citations, the automated car and ADAS sensor systems could flag hazardous behavior and issue complaints (with documentation) that would lead to automated fines :) The same decision methods driving the automated car's decisions would be applied to surrounding cars. This could lead to better behavior for all drivers!

They're not just en vogue - they're the future. By Jeremy Goldman Jeremy Goldman is the founder and CEO of Firebrand Group, which counts Consumer Reports, L'Oréal, and Unilever among its clientele. He is the author of Going Social: Excite Customers, Generate Buzz, and Energize Your Brand With the Power of Social Media, the 2013 award winner that teaches brands large and small how to use social media for business success. @jeremarketer Founder and CEO, Firebrand Group @jeremarketer WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement One of the individuals I was fortunate enough to interview for my 20.17 Big Ideas for 2017 series, where I asked leading experts for their advice on the year ahead, was Greg McNeal, co-founder of AirMap. The hot startup ($15 million Series A funding round in 2016) has created a low-altitude airspace management system that's been already adopted by 125 US airports and counting. Moreover, thanks to partnerships with manufacturers like DJI and Intel, AirMap's system has been baked into 80% of today's drones. McNeal, an an expert on drone regulation and policy, believes that understanding the rise of the "Smart City" of tomorrow will give you a leg up in 2017. Here's some of our conversation: Fascinating topic. Why should the rise of the Smart City matter to the typical businessperson? Demographic shifts show us that people are moving to cities in droves. We're becoming an increasingly urban nation: the city is the backdrop for all of the economic, commercial and social activities of our lives. And as cities become denser and more urban, they are relying on technology to help them accommodate the influx of new residents and improve quality of life for all. Today, that takes the form of ridesharing and platforms for civic tech and data sharing. Tomorrow, cities will be the first use cases of mobility solutions that seem like science fiction. You'll hail a flying Uber for your daily commute - and much sooner than you think. Cities have become some of the most vibrant and progressive places for technological development. They have dense cellular networks to facilitate connectivity and information sharing. They've become hubs for Internet of Things sensors that can help us describe our world. And they bring together bright, creative people in close proximity to each other, catalyzing innovation. What technologies in particular are you paying close attention to, with respect to smart cities? Top of mind for me in the smart cities space: platforms for autonomous navigation, connectivity (cellular and GPS), civic tech, and of course, drones. Smart city technology often starts with the need to deliver services more rapidly and more efficiently to residents. Drones have a tremendous amount of potential to help cities better serve the people who live in them. Today, thousands of drones are already being used to improve city life: drones are being used to document accident scenes, support first responder activities, monitor construction sites, and more. In 2017, we'll see drones take on more of these responsibilities, and tasks that are dull or dangerous for city workers. This is just the very beginning. In the future, connected drones will navigate autonomously through cities. Millions of both commercial and civic drones will fly billions of missions to serve city residents. With that, I suspect that cities will want to make rules about where drones can take off, land, and operate above city streets - guidelines that will determine how the industry grows and cities flourish. AirMap's obviously had a big year in 2016. What's next for you in 2017? The vast majority of drones operating today with network connectivity receive airspace data to help the operator make safe flight decisions - and they likely get that info from AirMap. More than a million drones, the vast majority worldwide, are powered by AirMap (our main competitor is non-consumption) and we expect that trend to continue. In 2017, we will be expanding our network of stakeholders, which presently includes more than 125 airports. And we will continue to work with the FAA and provide thought leadership locally and globally to ensure that cities and their residents benefit from drones, and that drones are used in safe and accountable ways. We'll also be announcing partnerships with major corporations that share our vision of the future. With that said, it's difficult to predict what will happen in 2017. We're only 18 months old, and already we have a team of 45, and 90% market share. Who knows what the future will bring - but we're excited about all of the opportunities on the horizon. How do you feel that AirMap fits into the architecture of the smart cities of tomorrow? AirMap's airspace management platform is the only one connected to over a million drones, so we're already playing a role in cities today. Drones are about to become an indispensable part of city life, and we're talking to state and local stakeholders to help create an environment that allows drones to flourish, while also giving local concerns a seat at the table. We're building a technology solution - which many people call Unmanned Traffic Management - to help make drones a part of everyday life. Coda Looking for more Big Ideas for 2017?

He quoted the Russian President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov as saying that Moscow knows nothing about the true goals of the authors of the US intelligence report on the suspected Russian hacker attack. "The absolutely unfounded accusations (in the published part of the report) sound at a rather amateurishly emotional level that can be hardly applied to the highly professional work of high-class [intelligence] services," Peskov said. "We still don't know what the facts are and what data those who make such unfounded accusations have," he added. For his part, US State Department spokesman John Kirby attributed the lack of evidence in the report of to the desire of US intelligence to maintain the secrecy of their sources of information and methods of work. © REUTERS/ Lucas Jackson 'Tremendous Blot on Their Record' - Trump Slams Intel Community for Endorsing Fake ReportMeanwhile, opponents of Trump in the US are sparking suspicions, Ilyashenko said, quoting New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow as saying that "Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's American 'president' — clearly his preference and possibly his product." "Mr. Trump, your victory is tainted; your legitimacy is rightly in question," according to Blow. "However, if we proceed from this assumption, it turns out that the Democrats left a bad legacy for Trump, who will be the President of a country where public opinion and the outcome of the presidential elections can be affected by the leader of another country with the help of hackers. So it seems that the authors of the report try to avoid making such conclusions," Ilyashenko said. "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion," he quoted them as saying. Ilyashenko predicted that the next round of domestic political confrontation in the US will certainly start amid the US Congress' discussion of the Trump team's candidates.  "For Democrats, this will be another opportunity to slam Trump's election promises and his personnel policy. It appears that the Democrats do not realize the fact that their continuous attacks on Trump's political reputation not only weaken his position, but also damage the international clout of the US," Ilyashenko pointed out. © REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst Isn't It Time to Admit? Trump Won Elections Without "Kremlin's Support"He added that social inequality in the US, which was a major factor adding to Trump's election win, is now accompanied by a political split between his supporters and opponents, as well as a standoff between Trump and the media, intelligence community, intellectuals, businesspeople and minorities. Both US allies and rivals, including Russia, China, Japan and the EU, are keeping a watchful eye on how Trump will respond to the attacks against the legitimacy of his presidency, and how he will compensate for weakness caused by permanent internal political conflict, according to Ilyashenko. "The current situation does not add to the stability of international affairs. Rather to the contrary," Ilyashenko concluded. ...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Foxconn Plan Close to Completion for a Massive U.S. Plant in the U.S. to Make LCD Displays and More | Main | Samsung & Foxconn Jointly Invest in Israeli firm Core Photonics Possibly Delaying a Dual Lens Camera for Galaxy S8 » January 13, 2017 It's a Long Shot, but TSMC wouldn't rule out Opening a U.S. Plant to Support U.S. Customers like Apple and Qualcomm   It's definitely the talk of Asia. Earlier today a Sharp executive revealed that a new Sharp/Foxconn plant is being planned for the US. Many Asian companies have made announcements about opening a plant in the US or are planning one and yesterday even TSMC's chairman said that they're now considering a plant in the US.    It's being reported today in Taipei that Chairman Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. stated yesterday that he would not rule out the possibility of building a new facility in the U.S. although its American customers including Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia could suffer if its chips were produced there.   "I will not rule out [the possibility of build a factory in the U.S.] but I see a lot of sacrifices that we and our customers will have to make," Chang told investors and reporters. However, he added that he felt no pressure from customers to move production to the U.S., despite incoming President Donald Trump's pledge to move jobs home. TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker.   Apple is TSMC's no.1 customer and the Taiwanese tech giant enjoys a monopoly in the production of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7-plus chips, which are among the most expensive components used in the handsets. TSMC also supplies to Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Marvell, among some 470 others across the globe. U.S. customers make up 66% of the company's record revenue of 947.93 billion New Taiwan dollars ($30.12 billion) in 2016.   Chang says "TSMC leads the industry with 55% of market share not because it uses cheaper labor, but because it has built an ecosystem of semiconductor suppliers in Taiwan. TSMC infrastructure and facilities allow thousands of the company's engineers to commute from one manufacturing site to another frequently in a very short time. Such advantages allow TSMC to produce efficiently and solve problems quickly to maintain a competitive edge. If we lose these advantages, our customers will lose too." Though in the age of teleconferencing is that really a problem?   At present TSMC only has a small manufacturing subsidiary, WaferTech, that hires around 1,500 employees in Camas, Washington in the U.S. In Taiwan, it employs more than 40,000 staff.   The report also noted that "TSMC announced yesterday that for the January-March period, TSMC forecast sales of NT$236 billion to NT$239 billion, representing a rise of 15.9 % to 17.4% from a year ago." However, it should be noted that this forecast contradicts a new DigiTimes report today.   The DigiTimes report states that "Pure-play foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has forecast revenues will fall up to 10% sequentially in the first quarter of 2017, and expressed caution over the prospects for the second quarter.   Lastly, Li said that TSMC will most likely continue to be the main supplier of processor chips to Apple's next iPhone model to be released in the second half of 2017.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

🔍 Home Magazines Advertising Events Videos Contact us Special Reports Sunday, January 15, 2017 Shipbuilding/Repair Deepwater Offshore Coastal/Inland Government Equipment Training Law & Regulations Europort Tackles Shipping’s big issues By Joseph R. Fonseca January 13, 2017 Logo Shipping’s data revolution, its environmental responsibilities and its continuing reliance on ‘the human factor’ will be the focus of attention as the eyes of the maritime world turn once more to Rotterdam between 7th-10th November 2017, for the staging of the long-established, and always well-supported Europort event.   Organised by Rotterdam Ahoy, Europort is the highlight of the maritime exhibition calendar in 2017, with a finely crafted programme expected to attract an estimated 30,000 visitors and 1,100 exhibitors.   The Europort exhibition team has chosen three highly topical themes for the event this year. These are: Big Data; The New Environmental Age; and The Human Factor. Raymond Siliakus, Exhibition Manager, says: "Each of these themes is very different, but all three come together to drive forward the event's overarching aim - to help maximise vessel performance - and as such will have an increasingly important role in shaping the world of shipping and shipbuilding over the months and years ahead. We have selected these three very current themes to ensure that attending Europort will be a hugely rewarding and valuable experience, with benefits extending well into the future for those visiting and exhibiting."   Many leading technology suppliers, shipbuilders and shipping companies are exploring the scope of using Big Data methodologies to develop 'smart ships' that will be safer, more efficient and cost effective. As an illustration of the trend, last year the world's biggest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, joined forces with tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) to develop smart shipping software solutions that are expected to yield benefits in terms of crew wellbeing, technical inspections, equipment maintenance and voyage information recording. Furthermore, Rolls-Royce, whose subsidiary MTU will be exhibiting at Europort, recently formed a strategic alliance with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to develop the first generation of remote and autonomous ships, while another exhibitor, Lloyd’s Register, acquired Big Data company Real Time Adaptive Maintenance Optimisation (RTAMO) and plans to roll out its software to commercial shipping.   Europort will provide a showcase for new generation IT and system integration tools, ultra-sensitive monitoring, condition-based maintenance, fleet performance management and other types of data analysis needed to help owners and operators enhance cost efficiency and reliability. "If you are involved in Big Data and are targeting the maritime sector, then Europort 2017 is the place to be," adds Siliakus.  The popular Europort Masterclasses will be returning this year and there will be daily Masterclasses specifically targeted at this theme.   International regulations continue to drive the development of environmentally friendly technology. The entry into force later this year of IMO's Ballast Water Convention will require major investment in ballast water technology, both in new ships and as retrofits. The IMO cap on fuel sulphur content is also due to enter force in 2020.  Both developments will require the evaluation of available technologies to ensure compliance. Europort’s focus this year will not simply be the solutions aimed at compliance, but those providing a competitive advantage, with exhibits to include alternative fuels, high tech coatings and solar cell systems. As Siliakus points out: "The underlying message will be clear. Clean and efficient shipping is central to a profitable and sustainable business model."   A special conference on Alternative Ship Power & Propulsion Systems, organised by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (RINA), will be held on November 8th. This will examine the current use of alternative fuels in shipping and how to embrace the challenges of designing cleaner, lower carbon emission vessels.   Remaining competitive today in the maritime industry also relies on having a skilled and motivated workforce, able to innovate and operate efficiently. Europort will provide a forum for a well-timed discussion on the importance of investing in human capital, with the opportunity to engage with academic institutions and training bodies on how to attract and retain the younger generation.   Many believe the maritime industry is facing a workforce crisis, with a lack of younger seafarers to fill the gaps left by the retirement of an ageing workforce, putting marine companies under renewed pressure. The U.K. Department for Transport (DFT) predicts a shortfall of around 3,500 deck and engineering officers by 2021 in the UK alone, while the BIMCO / ICS Manpower Report suggests there could be a worldwide global shortfall of 147,500 officers by 2025. This shortfall in human resources is evident not just in the deep-sea segment, but across the maritime industry, where specialists and technical staff with very specific areas of expertise are required, as shipping moves to embrace robot technology, automation and advanced data capture tools, among other advanced technologies.   Email Related News Transas Brings THESIS to its 2017 Forum for Change The speaker line-up at the next annual Transas Global Conference confirms that the innovative digital solutions company is… U.S. 6th Fleet Exercises Ordnance Loading Capability in Rota U.S. 6th Fleet, in coordination with USS California (SSN 781), Navy Munitions Command Rota, Spain and Naval Submarine Support… US-flag Cargo on the Great Lakes Down 4.5% in 2016 U.S.-flag Great Lakes freighters (lakers) moved 83.3 million tons of cargo in 2016, a decrease of 4.5 percent compared to 2015… Fourth Submarine in UK’s Astute Class Named The fourth submarine in the Astute class was officially named Audacious during a December 16 ceremony at builder BAE Systems’… Supersizing Car Carriers Similar to container vessels, bulk carriers and cruise ships, car carriers are rapidly growing in size, says a report by DNV GL.

The prototypes offered the world's first automated triple display laptops. Razer combined its best industrial design and powerful modern hardware from the likes of Sharp, Intel and Nvidia to create this portable triple display workstation which weighed a reasonable 5.4Kg and folded to just 1.5-inch thick. Reports earlier this week came in saying that the two Razer Project Valerie laptops at CES 2017 had been stolen. Later the reports were confirmed by Razer boss Min-Liang Tan, who posted a $25,000 reward, in return for "original information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of a criminal suspect". Now at least one of the prototype laptops has appeared on a Chinese auction/sales site called Taobao. It looks like WCCFTech was among the first to spot the Chinese listing of these stolen goods. The machines, which went missing from the Razer Press room about 4pm PST on Sunday, 8th January, have now surfaced in mainland China. Appealing to his Facebook fans, Tan previously wrote the following about the theft; "At Razer, we play hard and we play fair. Our teams worked months on end to conceptualize and develop these units and we pride ourselves in pushing the envelope to deliver the latest and greatest." "We treat theft/larceny, and if relevant to this case, industrial espionage, very seriously – it is cheating, and cheating doesn't sit well with us. Penalties for such crimes are grievous and anyone who would do this clearly isn't very smart." This case currently looks like a plain old sneaky opportunist theft. Unless the other machine has been sold to some Chinese PC hardware copyists, at least it looks like Min-Liang Tan's worst fears of industrial espionage don't seem to have played out. It will be interesting to see how this case develops now that there appears to be a public 'fence' selling the stolen goods for 150,000 Yuan, which is about £17,800 / $21,700. Surely Chinese authorities will be able to act on this blatant and obvious case of theft?

Amid a deluge of new gadgets, the tech industry searches for its soul By Mark Gauger Mark Gauger has been involved in product development for over 25 years. He is passionate about the role of great design as an element and a facilitator of corporate strategy, and he consults regularly with business leaders on how to transform their businesses with design. Prior to founding argodesign with his longtime colleague, Mark was the President and Chief Business Officer for Globant. From 2002 to 2012, Mark held various roles inside of frogdesign, ultimately taking over as the Chief Development Officer in 2007, where he oversaw frog's entry into the world of first-party application development, among other duties. @megauger Founder, Argodesign@megauger WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Courtesy Camille Woods, Argodesign Advertisement After attending this year's bigger-than-ever Consumer Electronics Show, I had the distinct impression that the future will not be televised. A major arc at the show was the evolution of the human-computer interface beyond a keypad or screen. The boxes, screens, and keyboards of computing's past are morphing into a ubiquitous, flexible, and smart presence that is personalized to a user's needs--for example, in the form of Amazon Alexa--and activated by voice or gesture. Although ultra-thin screens and barely there bezels still captured the headlines, I'll put my money on the ever-expanding universe of screen-less products and services--Razer's Project Ariana, HoloLamp, and the latest in mixed reality glasses. Intel's Project Alloy merges augmented and virtual reality together in a headset with full wireless positional tracking and multi-room tracking, to create what the company has coined "merged" reality, and that will facilitate multiplayer virtual gaming among other things. The shift to voice, gesture, and projection computing is led by the gaming and entertainment sectors, but slowly seeping into the home and the office as well. The Sevenhugs smart remote wirelessly connects to sensors placed throughout a room. Aim the remote at a lamp and Philips Hue's interface will pop up. Point it at your Nest thermostat and you can change the temperature of the room. Pointing it at the door will let you call an Uber straight from your remote. A second arc, related to Alexa's ascendance, was the onslaught of new Internet of Things enabled gadgets. The breathless enthusiasm for smart trashcans was palpable, and so was the skepticism. Do IoT products solve actual human needs or simply fuel an insatiable appetite for new gadgets? As my colleague Mark Rolston observed about CES, "It's like one big Sky Mall catalogue--a lot of junk looking for a purpose. If I have a smart toothbrush, a smart hairbrush, and a smart bathroom mirror, how do they work together to make my life measurably better?" It will be interesting to watch the evolution of the Alexa ecosystem--companies developing products and services compatible with Amazon Echo--as well as the trajectory of Echo copycats. Could Alexa and her ilk become the "personalities" that bring the IoT to the next level? It's telling that the Consumer Electronics Association gave the chipmaker Nvidia a keynote slot, and that their CEO used the opportunity to convey his ambitious agenda for AI-powered assistants operating in all areas of human activity. A third arc at CES was the continuing march of AI into our everyday lives. Nvidia is best known for the high-end computer graphics cards. In the future, it wants to be known as the powerhouse behind artificial intelligence in your home and in your vehicle. The company is at the intersection of key, changing dynamics in the tech industry, notably AI and deep learning and their respective roles in pushing home entertainment and in fueling those next generation autonomous vehicles. Nvidia wants to spread AI through the home via an upcoming, yet-to-be-priced ball-shaped peripheral for its SHIELD streaming system called Nvidia Spot. Each has tiny far-field processing microphones and echo cancellation to pick up your speech from 20 feet away. SHIELD also integrates with Samsung's SmartThings hub to connect to smart plugs, coffeemakers, garage doors, locks, thermostats, cameras and other devices. Nvidia also showed off a tiny AI-car supercomputer called Xavier meant to be the brains in future self-driving cars. Which brings us to my fourth and final arc: the rapidly emerging autonomous vehicle, which seems to be arriving faster than anyone has thought. Imagine, Ford arrived to CES seven years ago with the Sync system, and a CEO that dismissed autonomous vehicles "in my lifetime." Fast forward to today and Ford insists we will see fully autonomous cars, without steering wheels, by 2021.The introduction of new smart car models was the hit of the show. Faraday Futures grabbed the headlines, but the Vision Van from Mercedes packed autonomous features with drones and robotics to give a more realistic glimpse of the fast-moving and diverse future the vehicle manufacturers have in store for us. Buckle up. Through it all my sense from touring the Sky Mall at the Las Vegas Convention Center is that non-trivial technologies will still be the big winners in 2017. We need more technologies that combine "humanistic" interfaces like voice and gesture with advanced machine intelligence to help us solve real-world problems, like healthcare or making water infrastructure more resilient against extreme weather. Just as CES was drawing to a close, a mammoth storm slammed into Northern California and Nevada, causing floods and landslides and pushing already vulnerable water and wastewater infrastructure to the breaking point. A smart bathroom may drive foot traffic on an expo floor, but a smart sewer system is the kind of technology that makes a lasting impact. There's serious buzz about a tech backlash unless we get our priorities straight--entrepreneur Ross Mayfield says, "Tech can do more than grow. It can do good. And if doesn't, bad things will happen." In an age of global jitters and digital clutter, doing worthwhile work is foremost on everyone's minds.

The Legion Y720 might have been a long time coming, but it looks set to make a big first impression: It's got all the Intel- and Nvidia-provided power you need for VR, gamer-pleasing features like a built-in wireles adapter for an Xbox One controler, and a backlit keyboard for anyone that insists on turning their desktop into an all-night rave. Oh, and it's the first laptop with Dolby Atmos surround sound. No biggie. This is actually the first of many Lenovo gaming machines, which will arrive under the Legion gaming brand. Should you be excited? We went hands-on at CES 2017 to find out. Devil in the details Take one look at the Legion and you just know it's a gaming laptop. Those bright LED lights, colossal display, and prominent speaker grilles are anything but subtle.  It has a lot in common with the Alienware 15: when the lid's closed, it's fairly unobtrusive (yet seriously chunky), but open it up and the lashings of red are guaranteed to get you noticed.  Underneath that cavernous chassis, the Legion Y720 ticks all the boxes for a 2017 gaming laptop. The base model kicks things off with an Intel Core i5 CPU, Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip, 512GB SSD and 15.6in, 1080p screen. Got some cash to splash? You can upgrade to an i7 CPU, add a 1TB SSD or 2TB hard disk, and make the jump to a 4K display. Annoyingly there's no way to add a better graphics card, though - the GTX 1070 and 1080 are off the cards. Try out this monitor LG's HDR screen Game On The GTX 1060 is still ready for virtual reality, though, and the Legion has all the ports you'll need to hook up an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. There's even a Thunderbolt/USB Type-C port on top of the three regular USB3 ports. Handy. Lenovo's Entertainment Hub software lets you watch your regular old 2D videos in VR, from inside a simulation of a cinema, and adds head-tracking to your non-VR games. We tried it out with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and while it takes some getting used to, works across every VR headset out there - including Lenovo's own upcoming HMD. The Legion is also one of the first laptops we've seen with built-in Dolby Atmos surround sound. Lenovo reckons it's the first in the world with the tech, but until it actually goes on sale, there's still time for another company to swoop in and steal first place. Either way, it's supposed to produce precisely-pinpointed surround sound from just two speakers.  It was difficult to test out properly in a trade show environment, but if you’re going to be holed up in a hotel room with only this laptop as entertainment, it should be able to service your gaming, movie and music needs. When you're not gaming, you should get about five hours of battery life - not bad for a 15in PC this powerful.  Check out more laptops The latest issue of Stuff Lenovo Legion Y720 initial verdict I tried the Y720 with a 4K display, which looks absolutely stunning up close. The keyboard felt great to type on, too, but I'm not convinced the multicolour backlighting is worth paying extra for. Whether you’ve got a VR headset or not, though, chances are you’re going to want to play some games using a gamepad, and this is where the Legion Y720 has you covered as well. The built-in Xbox One wireless receiver lets you use up to four of the console’s controllers at once, without having a mess of wires trailing from players to laptop. We love the Xbox One controller for gaming, especially in its Elite form, and expect plenty of Legion owners to make the most of this (still pretty unique) feature. You should be able to pick up a Legion Y720 in April, but there's no word on price just yet. We're planning on giving it a full review a little closer to launch, though, so make sure to check back once we've given one a proper gaming workout.

"We don't believe that we were hacked," the channel said.

He said the network is "investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence." The feed of the House floor cut to RT Thursday afternoon during the middle of a speech by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Waters told the New York Times she found the timing of the incident "strange." "I just think it's strange," Waters said. "At a time when our intelligence agencies are very confident and basically have confirmed that Russia hacked the D.N.C. and other political interests, and then we have, while I'm on the floor of the House, talking about Trump and Russia, I get interfered with and interrupted by Russia Today." The programming glitch came hours after a power outage interrupted a Senate confirmation hearing for Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA. The hearing reconvened in a different room.

Home News Artikel Videos Community Forum Erweiterte Suche Home --> News --> Mobile Computing 13.01.2017, 08:11 | Quelle: GSMArena <<< News >>> HTC U Ultra (5,7'') & U Play (5,2'') 2 neue Smartphones mit Dual-Display: HTC Sense Companion HTC hat zwei neue Smartphones der neuen U-Serie vorgestellt: HTC U Ultra in 5,7 Zoll mit QHD-Display und HTC U Play in 5,2" mit FullHD. Die Hardware unterscheidet sich deutlich voneinander, aber beiden gemeinsam ist der "Sense Companion" - ein zweites Display mit Benachrichtigungen. Interessant ist das HTC U Ultra Sondermodell. Es verfügt über kratzfestes Saphirglas. Anzeige Das HTC U Ultra ist ein neues Flaggschiff neben dem HTC 10. Das 5,7-Zoll-Display (super LCD 5) besitzt eine Auflösung von 2560x1440 Pixel (QuadHD). Neben Corning Gorilla Glas 5 setzt HTC bemerkenswerterweise auf absolut kratzfestes Saphirglas rund um das Gehäuse, zumindest beim großen Modell mit 128 GByte Speicherplatz. Die etwas günstigere Variante mit 64 GByte muss ohne auskommen. Der Hauptspeicher ist mit 4 GByte aber immerhin gleich groß und beide Handy-Speicher können per MicroSD-Karte selbst erweitert werden. Im oberen Bereich des Bildschirms findet man den "Sense Companion", praktisch ein zweites Display, was immer aktiv sein soll. Es zeigt nicht nur die üblichen Benachrichtigungen, sondern auch Vorschläge, die auf dein Verhalten und deine üblichen Aktivitäten basieren sollen. Das Smartphone basiert auf dem Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Chipsatz mit vier Kryo Kernen (zweimal 2,15 und zweimal 1,6 GHz). Der Akku besitzt eine Kapazität von 3000 mAh und unterstützt schnelles Aufladen über den USB Typ-C Anschluss. Einen klassischen 3,5-mm-Kopfhöreranschluss spart sich HTC. Dafür soll sich die Audioausgabe mit speziellen Kopfhörern an das Ohr des Trägers anpassen, angeblich besser als ein Equalizer. Die Hauptkamera hat sich das HTC U Ultra vom HTC 10 geliehen und liefert 12 Megapixel (HTC UltraPixel 2) mit 1,55 µm großen Pixeln hinter einer f/1.8 Linse mit optischem Bildstabilisator. Für Selfies gibt es eine 16-MP-Kamera, die auch 4 MP UltraPixel liefert. Das HTC U Ultra kommt in einem Vollmetallgehäuse mit Glasüberzug, misst 162,4x79,8x8 mm und wiegt 170 Gramm. Als Betriebssystem kommt Android 7.0 (Nougat) zum Einsatz. Das Phablet soll noch in diesem Quartal erhältlich sein, vermutlich im März. Der Preis der 64-GByte-Version liegt bei 750 US-Dollar. Das HTC U Play ist mit 5,2"-Display (1920x1080 Pixel) deutlich kleiner, kommt aber auch mit dem Sense Companion. Die Größe liegt bei 146x73x8 mm, das Gewicht beträgt 145 g. Das Gehäuse besteht rückseitig aus Aluminium mit Gorilla Glas frontseitig. Basis ist diesmal der schon etwas ältere MediaTek Helio P10 mit 8 ARM Cortex-A53 Kernen (viermal 2,0 GHz, viermal 1,2 GHz). Auch der Akku ist mit 2500 mAh etwas kleiner. Die Hauptkamera liefert 16 Megapixel und hat ebenfalls einen optischen Bildstabilisator, die Selfiecam kommt auch auf 16 MP. Einen Kopfhöreranschluss sucht man auch hier vergeblich, es kommt das selbe System mit USB Typ-C Anschluss wie beim HTC U Ultra zum Einsatz. Das HTC U Play nutzt dagegen noch das Android 6.0 Betriebsystem. Es wird zwei Versionen dieses Smartphones geben: eine mit 3 GByte Hauptspeicher und 32 GByte Speicherplatz sowie eine mit 4 GByte RAM und 64 GByte ROM. Der Speicherplatz kann auch hier per MicroSD-Karte um bis zu 2 TByte erweitert werden. Preise und Erscheinungstermine für das das HTC U Play nannte der taiwanische Hersteller noch nicht.

President Obama presents Vice President Joe Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House today. ASSOCIATED PRESS Vice President Joe Biden, left, wipes away a tear as President Obama surprises him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ASSOCIATED PRESS President Obama laughs with Vice President Joe Biden during a ceremony at the White House today. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print WASHINGTON — At the dusk of both of their political careers, surrounded by teary friends and family, President Obama bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Joe Biden today, the man he called “the finest vice president we have ever seen.” The vice president winced in shock as Obama announced he was conferring the nation’s highest civil honor on his right-hand-man for eight years. Biden turned away from the cameras, wiped away some tears, then stood stoically as Obama draped the blue-and-white ribbon around his neck. “I just hope that the asterisk in history that is attached to my name when they talk about this presidency is that I can say I was part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country,” Biden said. RELATED ARTICLE: Biden: Intel officials told us Trump allegations might leak There were standing ovations — several of them — at what had been billed as a modest farewell ceremony for Biden but evolved into a surprise bestowal of the Medal of Freedom, the last time Obama will present the honor. “I had no idea,” Biden said of the award, insisting he didn’t deserve it. It was the only time Obama has presented the medal “with distinction,” also awarded only once by each of the previous three presidents. One week out from the Obama administration’s end, a deep sense of nostalgia set in at the White House as longtime staffers pack up their offices, send out their last emails and bid farewell to the president they’ve served. On Tuesday, Obama returned home to Chicago to deliver his valedictory address, and next week he’ll depart Washington as ex-president just after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Obama, joined today by his wife and daughters, was effusive in his praise for the man who ran against him in 2008, then agreed to be his running mate. He said Biden had made him a better president, calling him “a lion of American history.” “To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard and to live life fully,” Obama said.   The famously plainspoken Biden has long said he only agreed to the job after Obama agreed he would be the last person in the room before major decisions were made. Over two terms, they developed a bond that both men said transcended the office, with their wives, children and Biden’s grandchildren becoming close friends. They disagreed, too, on occasion, including when Biden advocated against the high-stakes raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Biden’s tendency to veer off-script caused occasional headaches for the White House, such as when he unexpectedly announced support for gay marriage in advance of the 2012 re-election, forcing Obama to do the same soon after. Yet as they gathered for a final goodbye, none of that seemed on either man’s mind. Obama said there had been “no turf wars between our staffs,” a departure from other recent administrations. And Biden told the story of how after his son Beau Biden died in 2015, leaving behind a wife and children, Obama was distraught when Biden said he might sell his house to help support them, and offered to give them money instead. It was a reunion for the many staffers and colleagues who worked with Biden over the years. Joining Biden’s wife, sister and children in the State Dining Room were former Sens. Chris Dodd and Ted Kaufman, former chief of staff Bruce Reed, and even Biden’s White House physician. Obama traced the history of Biden’s nearly half-century-long political career, from chairing the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees to the “cancer moonshot” effort he started recently and plans to continue. Obama praised his vice president for his work on the economic stimulus, middle-class issues and curbing violence against women. “I’ve not mentioned Amtrak yet, or aviators. ‘Literally,‘” Obama said, invoking a few of the more famous “Bidenisms.” Biden’s career in Washington started in 1972 steeped in tragedy when his wife and infant daughter died in a car crash just before he was to be sworn in as U.S. senator. After exiting the national stage next week, he plans to stay active in Democratic politics and work on policy issues at a pair of institutes he’s developing at the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania. His folksy demeanor lent itself to plenty of jokes and caricatures, like the series of photos of Biden eating ice cream that exploded on social media. But Obama seemed fonder of the internet meme based on photos of him and Biden buddying it up. “This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance,” the president said.

Picture: THE TIMES The Internet of Things ( IoT) is one of the gadget industry’s brightest hopes in a world that’s saturated with smartphones. Sensors are cheap, and digital giants such as Amazon and Google are aggressively pushing their voice-command technology. The resulting hype, however, spawns inventions that should only exist in the corny worlds of science fiction. At this point, the IoT market is not well-quantified. Intel says there were 15-billion connected IoT devices in the world in 2015, a number the chip maker predicts will increase to 200-billion by 2020. Gartner, the tech consultancy, counted fewer than 5-billion devices in 2015 and predicted fewer than 21-billion by 2020. There’s a good reason for the gap: no one can predict which objects consumers and businesses will want to connect to the internet. So businesses are trying nearly everything, and were showing them off last week at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas: • GeniCan: scans empty cereal boxes, reorders them through an app; • FridgeCam: sends photos to your phone, helps write grocery lists; • Catspad: dispenses food and water for a full month through an app, it also tracks kitty caloric intake; • Sleep Number 360: a bed that tracks your sleep and sends the data to an app; • U: a shower that, you guessed it, is controlled with an app; • A line of "smart" home appliances from Samsung, including a touchscreen fridge that responds to voice commands and app-governed cooktops, washer-dryers and vacuum cleaners; • A connected lawnmower (the app is for maintenance purposes and for ordering parts) and a tool chest you can lock and unlock with an app. •A hairbrush from L’Oreal that measures "hair health" and reports it to an app that will recommend treatments; • A kind of Amazon Echo for kids, from toy maker Mattel, that can read your kid  bedtime stories. Those are new apps for your smartphone right there, for objects you never imagined could — or indeed should — be connected to the internet. These things are supposed to improve how you brush your hair and shop for groceries. But aren’t these solemn chores what helps keep us human? Besides: will your cat’s welcome be as warm after it realises a robot — not you — feeds it three times a day? Will you miss your child’s call in the middle of the night when she opts for a plastic gadget to read her a fairy tale? This is how capitalism works. People will offer things for sale in the hope other people will buy them, and if there’s no market, these objects will just disappear. On the other hand, as major companies adopt some of these offerings, they will soon become mainstream just because they will be pushed on consumers with the help of billion-dollar marketing budgets. Then, expect botnets of smart fridges and hacked smart showers that scald you just for fun. One of the devices presented at CES is a router that monitors the security of every connected device in the home, which seems wise after a hack brought the internet to a standstill for millions in October. It is only a matter of time before these gadgets must also defend against waves of "targeted" ads based on your ketchup consumption and the kid’s zeal for Maurice Sendak. That will be a dystopian world. I, for one, will steer clear of all these "smart" objects while "dumb" ones are still sold. An internet-connected device that solves a real problem is the rarest of rarities at this point. But I won’t deny that it’s also heartwarming that people are designing some of these things, and adventurous consumers are trying them out. That’s mostly because of the voice features, based in many cases on Amazon’s Alexa. Amazon has put the voice assistant in the cloud, allowing manufacturers to keep devices simple and cheap: all they need to do is record voice commands, send them off, and receive responses. The more Alexa is used in the weirdest contexts, the better it recognises complex or badly formulated commands and the more it learns of the endless diversity of human life. It’s good for the technology — which has many legitimate uses, from making driving safer to increasing the accessibility of services to disabled people — that some of us are willing to have regular conversations with their fridge.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 7:16PM Market research company IDC announced on Jan. 11 that the category of products that it refers to as "traditional [personal computers]" dropped 1.5% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 5.7% over the course of the entirety of 2016. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers could help the company regain lost share in 2017. Image source: Apple.  IDC said that the first quarter of 2016 was "still constrained by high inventory, free Windows 10 upgrades, and difficult comparisons to commercial replacements in 2014 that were fueled by the end of support for Windows XP." That said, IDC says that beginning in mid-2016, the personal computer market had "moved beyond these inhibitors and seen stabilizing commercial demand." IDC also said that the "contraction of the consumer [personal computer] market has also slowed as growth and competition from tablets and phones has eased up." Analyst Neha Mahajan with IDC did say that the fourth-quarter numbers "might signal regained consumer confidence in the [personal computer] market, with most of the sales being driven by aggressive holiday promotions," cautioning that "it needs to be seen how much of the real demand is carried forward in the coming quarters." This report certainly doesn't spell bad news for the personal computer market -- a contracting rate of decline is certainly preferable to a stable or accelerating rate of decline -- but it does seem to reinforce the commonly held notion that the market isn't likely to be a growth one going forward. Vendor share shifts Although the personal computer market is down overall, there were some winners and losers among the major personal computer vendors. IDC's press release included significant details of the performances of the top five personal computer vendors by units -- Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, ASUS, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The report shows that Lenovo, the top vendor by units, saw shipments drop 3%, outpacing the overall market, and growing its market share to 21.3%, up from 20.8% in the prior year. HP Inc, which has talked at length about its efforts to gain share in the personal computer market (particularly in more lucrative sub-segments like premium thin-and-light PCs, gaming, and so on) managed to grow shipments by 1.3%, taking its share up to 20.9% from 19.4%. Privately held Dell enjoyed 4.3% growth, the fastest growing of the bunch. Its market share moved up from 14.2% to 15.7%. ASUS saw a modest 0.8% drop in unit shipments, which -- considering that the overall market dropped by 5.7% -- led to share growth from 7% to 7.4%. Apple -- which specializes in premium personal computers running its macOS operating system -- suffered a 9.8%-unit decline, taking its share down from 7.4% to just 7.1%. And, finally, the rest of the market combined -- which added up to about 72 million units -- suffered a drop in collective market share from 31.2% to 27.7%. In other words, the strong got stronger (save for Apple), and the weak got weaker. What this "consolidation" means for market players  IDC noted that there was "accelerated market consolidation" going on "as the largest players moved to lock up supply." This consolidation might have some interesting long-term consequences on the industry at large. Consolidation of power among system vendors should give them additional leverage/buying power with the major component vendors like microprocessor specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which supplies most of the central processing units (CPUs) that go into personal computers today. Intel's new seventh-generation Core processors were recently launched to allow computer vendors to refresh their systems. Image source: Intel.  The bigger the volumes any personal computer vendor commands, the steeper the volume discounts those vendors can demand from their suppliers. Such a dynamic may lead to decreased margins for the suppliers and increased margins for the system vendors (due to lower component costs). Consolidation may also mean that the winners should enjoy improved profitability as competitive pressures ease (potentially driving gross profit margins up) and the revenue shares of said winners improve (perhaps driving operating leverage).

"Gartner estimates the cost to be upwards of $500 million for one chip design." HYDERABAD: Invecas, a Hyderabad-based chip design is said to be at an advanced stage of creating intellectual property (IP) for a 7-nanometre chip for US-based semiconductor foundry GlobalFoundries, with which it has a strategic partnership. If successful, it makes Invecas the first Indian company to design such a cutting-edge and complex technology (FinFETs) that could be deployed to build high-performance data centres running complex computations with least power consumption.Other companies that have announced working on 7nm technology include Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Founded in 2014 by serial entrepreneur and former managing director of global chip giant AMD India, Dasaradha R Gude's startup has, over the past several months, added more chip designers bringing their number to 800 through a series of buyouts. "As far as we know, Invecas is the only company from India which is working on this technology with GlobalFoundries," says Invecas' CEO Dasaradha Gude. "It can be used in virtual reality cameras, for high-end computations and to build smaller devices with higher capabilities," he told ET. According to GlobalFoundries' chief executive Sanjay Jha, 7nm technology, relative to 14nm, reduces power consumption by nearly half, apart from increasing performance by close to a third. Further, in a presentation this week in Hyderabad, he said the 7nm design also reduces the cost per transistor, making it an important node for the industry. "Lot of people in the industry went from 14nm to 10nm and then 7nm," he said. "We made a decision to skip 10nm and go directly to 7nm," said Jha, expressing confidence that they would be in volume production with 7nm chip by next year. Experts corroborate that 7nm is among the most advanced technologies hat will lead to more functionalities integrated onto the chip, reducing power consumption and reducing the size of the chip itself. "The cost of designing a chip using 7nm technology is going to be very high," says Ganesh Ramamoorthy who tracks global markets for semiconductors at research firm Gartner. "Gartner estimates the cost to be upwards of $500 million for one chip design." However, the number would be for high-end chips and they were only working towards the building blocks. "We are into designing the IP. If a customer wants us to design the entire chip, we can do that as well," he said. With approximately $50 million investment thus far in the company, Gude is looking at investing double of that in the next five years. "We have good customers, so that helps us with the investment. But if we are looking at inorganic growth, only then would we need external funding," said Gude, whose company has clients from the fields of Internet of Things (IoT), processors and automotives.

A senior U.S. official said that it was FBI Director James Comey himself who pulled Trump aside after the briefing and spoke with him one-on-one about the so-called "dossier," 35 pages of memos prepared by a former British spy for an anti-Trump client prior to last year's election.

A summary of the 35 pages was prepared as background material for the intelligence briefing, but not discussed during the meeting, according to a senior official with knowledge of preparations for the briefing. During Trump's press conference Wednesday morning, the president-elect said he was made aware of the information "outside that meeting." The full 35-page document, which was published by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, includes claims that the Russian government has been cultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for five years — even obtaining compromising information in an effort to blackmail him. (BuzzFeed is partially funded by the parent company of NBC News.) The document, which was prepared by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele, contains obvious errors. It was originally generated as part of opposition research by anti-Trump Republicans and then shopped by Democrats.

Related: Seth Meyers Confronts Conway Over Trump Allegations Two U.S. officials told NBC News that materials prepared for Trump in advance of last week's intelligence briefing included damaging allegations from the memorandum — unverified by American intelligence agencies — about his dealings with the Russians. Officials prepared a two-page summary of the memo for Trump's briefing Friday at Trump Tower in New York. The summary was an "annex," or addendum, included in the "supporting documents" that accompanied the classified briefing report. While multiple officials say the summary was included in the material prepared for the briefers, the senior official told NBC News that the briefing was oral and no actual documents were left with the Trump team in New York. During the briefing, the president-elect was not briefed on the contents of the summary. "Intel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period," the senior official said. According to the senior official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted "disinformation." The briefers also had available to them unvetted "disinformation" about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not orally shared with Trump.

Amid increased interest in the dossier Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected all of the allegations out of hand. Trump later blamed intelligence agencies for allowing the dossier to leak, tweeting: "Are we living in Nazi Germany?" "The Kremlin does not have compromising information about Trump," Peskov said, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS. "It's a total hoax, absolute fabrication and utter nonsense. The Kremlin does not collect compromising information." Peskov also called the reports "pulp fiction." Trump did not respond to the reports directly but sent a tweet appearing to refer to it on Tuesday night. FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 Early Wednesday, he sent several others that followed Peskov's comments.

NBC News reported last week that the gulf between Trump and U.S. intelligence agencies had grown so wide that the two camps couldn't even agree on the scheduled date of a briefing Trump had been due to receive.

"It doesn't make us look like we are a healthy democracy." McFaul also said that Trump had contributed to an atmosphere in which "fake news" could flourish because of his past promotion of the unfounded "birther" conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama's birthplace. In an interview with NBC News before his farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago, Obama said he had not seen the news accounts of Trump's Russian ties but noted that "as a matter of principle and national security, I don't comment on classified information." Last month, Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for Russia's alleged cyberattacks in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election. The CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Trump win, and intelligence officials told NBC News that they believe "with a high level of confidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the covert campaign. Trump has been skeptical about the alleged Russian hacks, even as he repeatedly praised Putin. William M.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Will Shanklin 20 pictures New Atlas compares the features and specs of the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus (left) and Microsoft Surface Pro 4View gallery - 20 images Unless you count mobile tablets like the iPad Pro, Windows devices like the Surface have a monopoly on the 2-in-1 (tablet/laptop) form factor. That may change soon, as Samsung is launching a couple of Chromebook 2-in-1s that include Google Play for running Android apps. Let's see how the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus compare to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. 2-in-1 type The Chromebooks Plus and Pro utilize a 360° folding hinge, similar to Lenovo's Yoga series. The Surface Pro 4 is a detachable: tablet with a built-in kickstand and snap-on keyboard. Size Placed in landscape mode (as seen above), the Chromebooks measure 10-percent taller, but 4-percent narrower, than the Surface Pro 4. The depth measurements aren't directly comparable, since Microsoft's listing for the Surface is sans keyboard (Samsung measured the Chromebooks folded over). Weight Ditto for weights, where Microsoft's are for tablet only, while the keyboard is part of the Chromebooks. Build Both devices have magnesium builds. Colors Like the Surface, the new Chromebooks have silver backs with black bezels along their front. Display size Samsung appears to have taken a cue from its rival, using the exact same screen size (12.3-inch) and aspect ratio (3:2). Display resolution The Surface, however, has a 14-percent higher pixel density. Stylus Both machines use active styluses. Samsung appears to be using a similar (or the same?) S-Pen as seen in the Galaxy Note 5, with 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity and plastic build. The Surface Pen is made of aluminum and supports 1,024 levels. The Chromebooks have a slot to slide the pen inside, also similar to the Galaxy Note series. The Surface Pen magnetically latches onto the sides of the tablet. Touchscreen Being 2-in-1s, both devices support touch (and also have trackpads for laptop use). Processor The higher-end Chromebook Pro will match the entry-level Surface Pro 4, with an Intel Core m3 processor. Things veer off in opposite directions from there: a less powerful ARM processor in the Chromebook Plus and much faster Core i5 and i7 chips in the more expensive Surface Pro 4 models. RAM All models of the Chromebook have a mere 4 GB of RAM. Surface Pro 4 models with 256 GB storage and higher jump to a healthier 8 GB or 16 GB RAM. Storage The Chromebooks offer a mere 32 GB of storage, which would be more than enough if it ran Chrome OS only. With Android apps onboard, though, that could get limiting for users who install lots of space-hogging apps and games. MicroSD Both devices have microSD slots. Battery Battery specs are similar, but we'll need to run the Chromebooks through benchmarks before having much to say on this front. We would expect, however, a Chrome OS/Android device to require less power on average than a full Windows-running device like the Surface. Ports You're fairly limited on the port front either way: two USB-C ports on the Chromebooks, along with one USB 3.0 (the more common standard) with Mini DisplayPort for video out on the Surface. Biometric logins While Samsung's new Notebook 9 series has built-in fingerprint sensors, there are no biometric security options on the new Chromebooks. The Surface Pro 4 has built-in facial recognition and, if you prefer, an optional keyboard model with a fingerprint sensor. Software As we mentioned, we're looking at Chrome OS with Google Play support on the Chromebooks, and Windows 10 Pro on the Surface. While Chrome OS is little more than the Chrome browser used as an operating system, the addition of Android apps brings it closer to a direct competitor to Windows. For lighter users, this combination may fit the bill, but those who rely on intensive desktop apps like Photoshop or Lightroom may find their Android counterparts lacking compared to the full Windows versions. Release The less-powerful Chromebook Plus is scheduled to launch in February, with the Intel-running Chromebook Pro hanging back for a Spring (Northern hemisphere) launch. This isn't a good time to buy the Surface Pro 4 at full price. We don't yet know when Microsoft will launch upgraded models, but there were 16 months between releases of the last two Surface Pro models. If Redmond were to stick with the same turnaround schedule for the next upgrade (hardly a guarantee), that would have a Surface Pro 5 arriving around February of 2017. Starting price The Chromebook Plus will ring up for US$449, while Samsung has yet to announce pricing for the Pro. The Surface pricing listed above is for the entry-level (Core m3) model including keyboard cover, which is a separate purchase. Prices, as you'd imagine, shoot up from there. About the only case where we recommend buying the Surface Pro 4 this late in its release cycle is if you find it for significantly less than its MSRP (as you often will, at the time of publication).

By Tiernan Ray Biography January 14, 2017 For tech investors, every year begins with the ritual of quarterly earnings reports, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t always eager to see how they turn out. While a single three-month snapshot isn’t valuable for long-term investors, the way a stock responds to the numbers on a given day can give clues to the longer-term trajectory. Thus, attention must be paid. The season kicks off for tech this Tuesday afternoon, when chip... Get The Full Story Subscribe   or   Log In Want to participate in the discussion?

The Senate committee plans to "interview senior officials of both the outgoing and incoming administrations including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony." The probe comes after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government was likely involved in a covert campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and carry out cyber-attacks on Democratic Party organizations.

Think of it like a giant Best Buy that's incredibly crowded and filled with a bunch of stuff you can’t purchase yet. CES is open only to people involved in the electronics industry like retailers and buyers, and esteemed members of the unflinching press like yours truly. The name CES is actually rather deceiving, as the consumer class (a.k.a. "general public") is not permitted. The show’s organizers take great pride in the pedigree of its attendees, a fact made evident on the CES website where they boast that 68,331 senior-level executives attended last year, which is, in their words, “roughly the same number of works of art in the Louvre Museum.” Plenty of groundbreaking technologies have made their debuts at CES (which itself debuted in 1967), including the VCR (1970), CD players (1981), Nintendo Entertainment System (1985), and Blu-ray DVD (2003). This year, more than 3000 companies exhibited their wares and filled some 2.4 million square feet of floor space inside the multiple halls and wings of the Las Vegas Convention Center, as well as a few satellite areas in nearby hotels. The slogan for CES 2017 was “Innovators Always Think Ahead.” What kind of innovations do consumers have to look forward to this year? To find out I headed to Las Vegas, and I was sure to pack a heavy sense of contempt for the past so I could fit in amongst all the innovators. 1. “SMART” APPLIANCES What makes an appliance “smart”? A few years ago, all companies had to do was throw giant TVs on their refrigerators and they were all set. In 2017, however, you need to do a little more. Take, for example, the scene at LG’s exhibition space, which was the most crowded one I encountered. There was a legitimate crush to see washing machines that could do two loads of laundry at a time. It was like the Beatles at Shea Stadium (if John Lennon had been wearing a lanyard and LG-embroidered polo shirt). What caught my eye was a refrigerator dubbed the LG InstaView™ Door-in-Door. Sure, it has a sizable TV on its door, but this is a special TV. It’s a translucent tinted LED panel, and knocking on it twice activates an interior light that lets you see what’s inside. The LED panel also works as a giant computer touchscreen, and there are internet-connected cameras inside the fridge so you can watch livestreams of your food from your mobile phone while on the go. The refrigerator is connected to Amazon’s Alexa AI assistant because, as I quickly learned at CES, everything needs to be a talking robot now. When our civilization inevitably crumbles, future archeologists will dig up this refrigerator and have no idea that it’s actually just a big box that keeps things cold. This is an appliance for eccentric weirdos, and I love it. If you can convince yourself that you need to watch your leftovers via smartphone app, then you'll love it, too. 2. TELEVISIONS TVs are CES’s bread and butter. Televisions with integrated circuits debuted at the first CES in 1967, and since then HDTV (1998), Plasma TV (2001), OLED TV (2008), 3D TV (2010) and have had their coming-out parties at the event. What was the hot new TV trend this year? I couldn’t really tell. I can report that curved TVs are still a thing, which is nice if you’re into that. There was also this sphere HD TV, which I guess is for people who want to take curved TVs to their natural conclusion: If you plan on buying this television, you may want to save this handy link. It’s a website that calculates the visible fraction of a sphere’s total surface area, because this TV was designed to obscure the majority of its screen from viewers. Apart from that, it looks like TVs are continuing the trend of being flat and high definition. There aren’t many ways of showing that off, though plenty of companies tried their best. For example, Chinese electronics manufacturer ChangHong highlighted their TVs by having attendees play a game where you control a dolphin via “non-contact neuro bio monitor” (a device that reads and interprets brainwaves). I was unable to partake because the line was too long, but I observed enough to know I am not ready for this experience. One man stared at his little dolphin with such concentration that I thought his head was going to explode. After a minute or so of this intense mind-meld, the little animated dolphin moved a few inches and the man removed his arm band and handed it to the booth attendant. Visibly shaken, he muttered, “So … loud here … can’t concentrate … on … dolphin,” before wandering off into the crowd, I assume never to be seen again. 3. DRONES Drones were huge at CES this year. You couldn’t walk five feet without hearing the unmistakable high-pitched whirr of a quadcopter buzzing by. Of course, people weren’t allowed to pilot drones out in the open—that would be dangerous! Instead, every drone demonstration was performed inside one of the many drone cages that dotted the convention floor. These made the entire trade show feel as if it were some sort of human zoo, where attendees could gawk at the bipedal monsters who had nothing but remote-controlled mini-copters to keep themselves entertained all day inside their inescapable pens. Drones weren’t limited to the sky. A company called PowerVision unveiled their underwater maneuverable robot, which is designed to work as a scout camera for fishermen. Footage is relayed to an above-water screen, and the user can tow his or her lure to locations that have lots of fish. The company touts it as a chance to “Change the Fishing World,” which it undoubtedly will until marine life evolves to protect itself against advanced submersible robotics. 4. VIRTUAL REALITY If drones were big at CES this year, then VR was gargantuan. I’d venture to guess that at any given moment during the convention, 10 percent of attendees were wearing virtual reality goggles. Reality’s market share is dwindling, and it is not inconceivable to think that in 15 years there won’t even be a CES in Las Vegas; everyone will attend from the comfort of their living rooms. My first encounter with VR at CES was at the Intel exhibit area, where a long line of attendees patiently waited to partake in whatever this was: I think it was somehow related to Power Rangers because the emcee yelled, “You guys ready to go into the world of Power Rangers?” as the people sat there. Plenty of products that have nothing to do with virtual reality used the technology in some aspect of their display marketing, and this accounted for much of VR’s presence at CES. For example, the photo below was taken at the Hyundai exhibit. Hyundai is not releasing a VR helmet; I believe this was part of a parallel parking simulator: Elsewhere, I waited in line for 10 minutes to try out Magna’s Hololens augmented reality demonstration, which amounted to little more than a PowerPoint slideshow about the company’s business strategy and product plan. (I think they make automobile parts). I did play one enchanting VR game, however. It was from the Tsinghua Tongfang Company, and in it players scale a steep mountain using two pick axes (the controllers). It was a whole lot of fun, and looking down at the steep rock face was so dizzying that I almost lost my footing. Before summiting I unfortunately missed a rope hold and plummeted to my death, which was a rather relaxing experience thanks to the beautiful CGI mountain range and the comforting knowledge that I was not actually going to die. Afterwards I felt a little queasy and almost fell into a drone cage, but that did nothing to diminish the rock-climbing game’s status as the most pleasurable experience I had with VR at CES. 5. PHONE CASES Virtual reality was huge at CES, but not as big as phone cases. If the Las Vegas Convention Center was the Earth, and drones and VR served as its land, then the oceans would be phone cases—they were everywhere. There are only a few ways to differentiate yourself from your competition if you’re selling these products, and the endless rows of phone case booths blurred together. Peppiness certainly was a theme, and all the large-format advertorial photos at these displays depicted groups of attractive young men and women absolutely beaming at their phone cases. At one booth, a man dropped an egg on “an exaggerated” version of his company's proprietary phone case material. As someone who encounters repeated eggings year-round, he certainly got my attention. There were also phone cases that looked like prescription pill bottles. I choose to believe this is trenchant commentary on how our society-wide addiction to phones is killing us. (I’m not sure what the blinged-out Daffy Duck is supposed to represent. The dangers of government surveillance maybe?) 6. THIS MODEL TRAIN I became extremely excited when I saw this at the Canon booth, as I thought it meant model trains were making a comeback. Alas, it was there to demonstrate their cameras' new motion focus feature, which was far less fun than the train itself. 7. EVERYTHING ELSE The promise of driverless cars was a major theme at CES, representing perhaps the single most important technological advancement we will experience in our lifetimes. We can only begin to understand the effects these cars will have on our society as a whole, and the possibilities are tantalizing. There are very impressive self-driving cars currently on the road, like Teslas that can drive around and park themselves, but these still require an alert human at the wheel. There were plenty of self-driving cars at CES, while any true driverless cars were just ambitious prototypes whose full functionality is still beyond our reach. This may be why, in the video above, you can clearly see a guy using his steering wheel at a self-driving car exhibit. If driverless cars are still the not-quite-immediate future, what do consumers have to look forward to in 2017? How about Christmas lights that play music? “This is the most exciting marriage of sound and light since God invented thunder!” I said to myself at this display for Bluetooth speaker-connected Christmas lights from Bright Tunes. No one else was around, and I could have stolen a dozen. (I didn't.) There is a logic behind this invention: People play music during the holidays, and people also hang up lights. But why stop there? Are you really making us wait until CES 2018 to unveil the Wi-Fi-enabled eggnog drone and mistletoe camera? If that doesn't float your boat, the Swagtron booth had self-balancing electric scooters, which, according to the headline of this glowing review, are the "Hoverboard[s] That WON’T Go On Fire!" I am happy to report that I didn’t witness a single fire in the five minutes I spent at the Swagtron exhibit space, where helmeted models spun around on neon-lit hoverboards to a blaring electro soundtrack. The future of consumer electronics truly is dizzying. All photos and videos by Nick Greene.

The Senate committee plans to "interview senior officials of both the outgoing and incoming administrations including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony." The probe comes after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government was likely involved in a covert campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and carry out cyber-attacks on Democratic Party organizations.

Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict If basic broadband duties (i.e. web surfing) are all you require, then the SH3 is likely to fit the bill perfectly. But if the broadband quality/QoS is what you’re looking for, then the SH2ac is still probably the better of the two, at least until the issues with the new router are solved. For Ready for VoIP Stronger signal compared to previous model Intuitive backend Against Serious performance issues Lack of USB ports Massive power supply unit Existing Virgin Media customers can now get their hands on a brand new router if they want to (new customers get it by default, of course).  Launched almost a year ago now, the redesigned Hub 3.0 (or Super Hub 3) shares the same vertical form factor as its predecessors but adopts a more industrial, harsher, utilitarian design. The router (also known as the VMDG505) is available to all new Virgin Media broadband customers for free, as mentioned. Existing customers can upgrade to it for a fee, with the device supporting the company’s maximum download speed of 300Mbps (that’s Virgin Media’s HomeWorks). However, since this is a DOCSIS 3.0 modem with 24 bonded downstream channels and eight upstream ones, the theoretical download and upload speeds are far, far higher (912Mbps and 216Mbps respectively). Sadly, the Super Hub 3 is not DOCSIS 3.1 compatible which would have made it the first mainstream broadband router to support multi-gigabit download and upload speeds (up to a theoretical 10Gbps/2Gbps). Available in black or white, the router looks a bit like a small speaker – thanks to its grilled sides – and blends seamlessly in with any modern décor. Congrats to the design team for coming up with something that looks less like a bland piece of tech and more like a piece of art.  The front panel hosts the Wi-Fi light, the internet activity light, a phone light, a power LED and the WPS button. In normal operation, one white soft light should remain on unlike the blinking blue lights on the previous one. Around the back you get two inactive/disabled telephone ports, four Gigabit Ethernet ports, a reset button, the power switch, a port for the power cable and the coaxial cable connector. Setting up the router is a doddle and doesn’t require any specific skill other than the ability to use the bundled proprietary spanner.  Virgin Media’s online do-it-yourself guides are as straightforward as can be, and if you run into any issues, an operator can run a diagnostic test remotely and decide whether to send an engineer onsite. Note that the router comes with stickers featuring your login details so that you can display these around the house; just be careful that these aren’t visible through your windows. There’s also a removable card slotted in the router’s base, along with yet another sticker underneath the device. Inside is where all the action happens. The modem, which is built by Arris and is known as the TG2492LG-VM (there’s even a mention on the bottom plate), is packed with five antennas but doesn’t have any USB ports. This means you won’t be able to connect a hard drive or a printer to it directly; a rather major let-down compared to some of the competition on the market. The two telephone ports pave the way for a potential VoIP service. Currently, the phone connection on Virgin Media is physically separate from the broadband one – merging the two together makes sense and could lead to some serious cost savings and ease problem solving. There’s support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi with up to three spatial streams on the 5GHz band. Other features include Web Safe, F-Secure SAFE and the usual DHCP and firewall which can be tweaked. The modem comes with a rather big power supply unit, a far heftier one compared to the previous Super Hub. Both are rated at 65W (20V, 3.25A) and have the same physical connector – while the increase in size won’t bother many, modems are often positioned in cramped spaces which makes massive PSUs a tad unsightly. For our hands on, the router was connected on a 50Mbps Virgin Media broadband fibre line which means that the modem was never totally maxed out; it didn’t even break a sweat (although it did warm up a bit). The Super Hub 3 wasn’t used for anything other than bog-standard web browsing. There have been reports about issues encountered by users, especially gamers and anyone whose work can be affected by high latency. Others have reported problems when the router was put in modem mode and connected to another router. Many said that the Super Hub would just shut down the port used by the external router. Last December, the root of the issue was identified as the Intel Puma 6 chipset that powers the modem, and the semiconductor giant has confirmed that there will be a firmware update that should, in theory, eliminate excessive lag and packet loss. Don’t expect that firmware to be released anytime soon, though, as it will have to be validated and extensively tested before it’s rolled out to potentially millions of routers across the country. Note that the latest firmware is 9.1.116V at the time of writing. The backend user interface offers a clean dashboard with all the essential features and three easy to access, quick setup wizards that allow you to configure your Wi-Fi connection, diagnose any glitches on your network, and modify your guest network. It’s worth noting that the modem status overview includes Telephony which alludes to a future offering that will include out-of-the-box VoIP telephony. Unlike the previous Superhub, this model shows one SSID that covers both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. By default, the modem offers a mixed mode option on the 5GHz band, but you might want to limit it to 802.11ac if you encounter any connectivity issues. The signal strength on the previous router troughed at -80dBm and -85dBm on 2.4GHz and 5GHz respectively, while that was marginally better for the Super Hub 3 at -76dBm and -85dBm for these two bands. The test was carried out using Wi-Fi Analyser on the same smartphone in the worst part of the property used for testing (no line of sight, two brick walls, a fridge and staircases in-between). Early verdict The brief encounter we had with the modem reasserted the belief that this is a non-essential upgrade to any existing customer already using the Super Hub 2ac. There is a slight improvement on the signal strength and you might get this new model for free if you haggle with customer service, but the issues identified make it too big a risk for anyone who needs more than bog-standard broadband. Gamers and enthusiasts will probably be better off downgrading to the Super Hub 2ac and using it as a modem with a top-of-the-range router.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr is the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and said Thursday his committee will not investigate Trump's alleged relationship with America's Cold War foe. Pelosi, who has criticized Trump several times, was not happy with that decision. "Leader [Mitch] McConnell is saying the [Senate] Intelligence Committee can do that. Meanwhile, the GOP chair of the Senate Intel Committee, Sen. Burr, announced he will not investigate Russia and the campaign in the U.S.," Pelosi said, reports the Washington Examiner. "That makes Republicans accomplices in my view of President-elect Trump's praise of Putin." Pelosi and other lawmakers met with FBI Director James Comey Friday in a closed session. She was unable to comment on what was talked about because the information was classified, but she and other Democrats would like the FBI to investigate a dossier that was made public this week, a document that claims Trump has ties to Russia.

The Needham, Massachusetts-based company competes with multinational giants such as Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., and counts Priceline Group Inc., Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. and Telefonica SA among its customers. Kaminario says its technology, which delivers storage solutions for online retail, gaming and finance companies, is luring customers away from the larger companies. “We are growing exponentially, doubling the company’s top line in the past four years,” founder and Chief Executive Officer Dani Golan said in a telephone interview. He attributed the company’s success to building flash storage “from the ground up,” instead of adding it to legacy products as competitors did.  “It’s really about the ability to access data faster and more consistently,” he said.

Beyond the industry giants, other flash storage companies include Pure Storage Inc. and Nimble Storage Inc. A third, SolidFire Inc., was acquired by NetApp for $870 million last year. Kaminario, which has raised a total of $218 million from Waterwood Group, Sequoia Capital, Lazarus Management Co. and Silicon Valley Bank, among others, would like to stay private “as long as we can,” Golan said. “We aren’t in a hurry to go public, but this is certainly the direction.” In an August report, IDC said Kaminario, which currently gets most of its sales from North America, was well-positioned to gain market share in Europe due its commitment to low-cost systems and innovation. “The storage market has always been very aggressive, with very entrenched players,” said Stu Miniman, senior analyst at Wikibon, an open-source research community. But for companies like Priceline, Kaminario is “well positioned and has a good story” because its product is easy to scale as website traffic grows.  “They’re hitting the big guys’ blind spot,” Miniman said. Some of the money raised in the latest round will go to integrating emerging hardware technologies. The company is also collaborating with hardware companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. to ensure when new products hit the market, “we can adapt very fast,” Golan said. The funds also will go toward boosting sales in Asia, particularly China. “The market is very early, and no one is clearly king of the hill yet,” said Steve Duplessie, senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group Inc. Kaminario must convince buyers to choose them over more established players, he said, but added that they’re succeeding at that so far.  “If they can take advantage of their technical advantages before the other guys catch up, they absolutely could be the next big thing,” Duplessie said.

But in a quieter series of moves, automakers also continued to strengthen their control over what it is we're able to do inside our cars, particularly when it comes to the apps that run on infotainment systems. Though carmakers have generally embraced Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto, many are hoping to establish an alternative app system that will be almost entirely under their purview. Automakers bill it as a move to create a seamless experience for their customers, but others in the industry see it as a way to cut Apple and Google out of the equation, so that vehicle manufacturers can continue to sell new services to customers. Carmakers are collaborating on, essentially, their own app store The boldest move in this direction came from Ford and Toyota, which together founded a group called the SmartDeviceLink Consortium. The consortium will focus on developing and promoting the use of a technology called SmartDeviceLink, which you can think of in loose terms as an app store run by automakers and capable of running on any car. More specifically, SmartDeviceLink allows existing iOS and Android apps to extend onto car infotainment systems when they're connected to a vehicle that supports the standard. While details like app settings and login information will transfer over from the phone, what displays on the infotainment system is in many ways a separate app, with separate software and separate oversight from automakers. That's critical. Automakers can choose which apps do and don't get to run on their cars. They can offer additional vehicle data to the apps, which Apple and Google won't get to see. And they can make deals with app developers to get a cut of any in-app sales they make, potentially opening up a major source of revenue. Ford has been shipping SmartDeviceLink, under the name AppLink, in cars for a few years now, with more than 5 million supported vehicles already on the road. Toyota plans to add SmartDeviceLink to select Toyota and Lexus vehicles next year. And Mazda, Suzuki, Subaru, and the French company behind Peugeot and Citroën have all agreed to join the coalition, too. Several companies that make vehicle head unit systems and software, including Harman, Panasonic, and BlackBerry's QNX, also plan to join. Don Butler, who oversees the connected vehicle and services unit at Ford, says the goal of SmartDeviceLink is "primarily" to create a seamless interface for customers. "It's to enable, from our perspective, a Ford unified experience inside our vehicles," he says. Likewise, other vehicle manufacturers would be able to apply SmartDeviceLink support on top of their own infotainment software. Data lost is money lost But the ability to keep apps and services inside a branded environment is hardly the only reason half a dozen automakers have joined the consortium. Depending on who you ask, the other reason may be even bigger: control over apps and data. "The lifetime value of a customer with [a carmaker] is typically around half a million dollars," says Roger Lanctot, an analyst with Strategy Analytics who focuses on infotainment systems. That value comes from the sale of services and new vehicles, he says. "Lose control [of the data], and they're losing out on some piece of that $500,000." There are a number of ways controlling the system keeps the carmaker in charge, Lanctot says. Maintaining access to driving data lets automakers connect drivers with insurers and net referral fees. Having control over vehicle systems data lets manufacturers choose when to recommend repairs, and controlling maps and apps lets them choose where to suggest you get those fixes done. And that’s just to start. Right now, CarPlay apps and Android Auto apps can't get most vehicle data. Ford says that's partially because of privacy concerns. But the ceding of all value that comes with vehicle data certainly plays a role. Apple and Google take away opportunity every trip they’re in control "At the highest level, yes it does give us more control over the experience and more control in terms of what the app is able to subscribe to, so to speak, in terms of the capabilities of the infotainment system," Butler says of SmartDeviceLink. Promoting their own experience can also help automakers build brand loyalty that comes into play when choosing which company to buy or lease a car from next. "If all I see on that car dashboard is Android and Apple ... that's what I identify with as a consumer," says Jeff MacDuff, VP of mobile products at Inrix, which is working on a competing in-car infotainment system called OpenCar. Inrix Though much quieter over the past week, Inrix drew attention during CES to its upcoming OpenCar platform by promising Alexa integration. Like SmartDeviceLink, OpenCar will let carmakers customize an infotainment system's software to their liking and tap into a common library of third-party apps. It too offers control over data and apps to automakers, so long as they're okay with outsourcing most of the system's development to Inrix. So far, MacDuff says, many auto companies are partnering with Inrix on OpenCar. He only named Mazda, but said more would be announced later this year. “You don't want to be the dumb pipe.” While not an infotainment service, another auto-owned alternative — the mapping company Here — received a major investment last week. Intel agreed to buy a significant stake in Here, putting it alongside Audi, BMW, and Mercedes as an owner, and offering the company more resources to work with. Their stake in Here keeps automakers and component suppliers, like Intel, in control over another aspect of what customers see inside their vehicles, rather than handing control to a service like Google Maps. Nathan Shipley, an auto industry analyst at The NPD Group, says maintaining control over vehicle data will be key to staying ahead as a manufacturer. Vehicles are becoming "computers on wheels," he says, where the car part is as important to a connect car as the phone part is to a smartphone. "So why do [automakers] want control over the data? It is and will become their competitive edge," he says. MacDuff at Inrix agrees that automakers won't want to give up this data. "The best analogy ... you don't want to be the dumb pipe," says MacDuff. "You don't want to be AT&T to the iPhone. The iPhone made telcos, for a consumer, largely irrelevant. If you're a brand, BMW or Audi, that's your customer and your data, and you want to use that data to delight that customer and have that customer attach." Ford There's no clear sign that automakers are going to find traction with these custom app systems. In fact, these aren’t even their first shot at it — an earlier connectivity standard, called MirrorLink, is supported by a number of car and phone manufacturers but has seen little traction with consumers or developers. Still, the fact that so much of the auto industry is willing to collaborate on alternatives and create shared ecosystems suggests maintaining control over what their customers see is a real priority. For their parts, Butler, of Ford, and MacDuff, of Inrix, do believe their systems will offer a better experience for customers, too. MacDuff says that apps coming from a phone will never be designed properly for a car. And Butler points out that, in some regions, like China, Apple doesn't have the same level of dominance and Android Auto isn't available, so an alternative is necessary. "We're not in a fight against Apple. We're not in a fight against Google.” Though carmakers may be competing with Apple and Google, Ford and many of its SmartDeviceLink partners — Toyota, notably, not included — are still staying open to CarPlay and Android Auto, to give customers the choice. "We're not in a fight against Apple. We're not in a fight against Google," Butler says. "We do want to promote a Ford experience." As long as that choice is open, winning customers over won’t be easy. People think of Apple and Google when it comes to apps, and both companies have shown dramatically better skills with software design and app ecosystem building than any car company has. And while automakers won’t ever have to hand more vehicle data over to CarPlay or Android Auto apps than they want to, they still have plenty of opportunity to lose. Every trip a driver has Apple or Google’s system pulled up is a trip they’re blocked from the customer’s view. And in the long run, that means losing a lot of value and brand loyalty from each driver. As MacDuff put it, if Apple and Google take over, “they're screwed.” In this Storystream Detroit Auto Show 2017: the biggest cars, concepts, and news The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures Why carmakers want to keep Apple and Google at arm's length The Lexus UX Concept looks like it will chew you up and spit you out View all 13 stories Next Up In Transportation Google takes another step towards launching its own self-driving Uber-killer with new patent The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography Tesla’s latest Autopilot update rolls back its speed cap on undivided roads Fiat Chrysler reportedly facing US criminal probe in emission scandal Takata will plead guilty to covering up recalled airbags, pay $1 billion Now Trending Apple removes app that let you find your AirPods Rogue One's reshoots show how Disney saved the first standalone Star Wars movie This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography The bizarro big business of Mark Wahlberg and national tragedy DirecTV Now appears to be a complete mess This Article has a component height of 50.

All rational governments try to affect the outcome of other countries’ elections and political conflicts when their tangible self-interest is at stake. The Soviet Union did it all the time; America has done it and still does it; as do the British, the Germans, the Saudis, the Iranians, and the Chinese. © Flickr/ Brian Klug Hacker Guccifer 2.0 Suspected of Cyberattacks on US Democrats Denies Links to MoscowOf course, Russia would try to influence the recent American election. After an explicitly hostile two-term Democratic administration, the prospect of at least another four years of Hillary Clinton-led hostility was never going to fill the Kremlin with gleeful anticipation. With both the Democratic and Republican party establishments deeply antagonistic toward Russia, Moscow would be guilty of a dereliction of duty to the Russian people if it had not wanted success for the most diplomatically pragmatic, and arguably the only realistic, American presidential candidate on issues such as radical Islamic terrorism, Syria, and Ukraine. In geopolitical terms, the Russian government continues to be an artful, amoral chess player, while the idealistic Obama administration still struggles to master the simple game of checkers. It should not be surprising, therefore, if Moscow took the steps necessary to acquire damaging material about Obama's Democratic party, while his party's unworldly leadership chose to equip its technological infrastructure with only elementary security. It would be ridiculous to think that other foreign governments also do not have tangible interests at stake, when it comes to the outcome of American presidential elections. Two recent examples involve America's closest economic, diplomatic, and military allies, Canada and the United Kingdom. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, an Obama acolyte, and his colleagues were devastated when Trump defeated Clinton. Trudeau's center-left government favors aggressive action against climate change, no changes to existing North American trade deals, the importation of large numbers of unvettable Middle Eastern migrants and refugees, and a dovish approach to Islamic State. © REUTERS/ Mike Segar US Democratic National Committee’s Negligence Allowed Hacking Into Party’s Servers – TrumpFrom the Canadian government's perspective, therefore, Ottawa's tangible interest in the outcome of the Trump versus Clinton contest, and Trudeau's well-known preference for the Democratic candidate, made a great deal of sense. And, Obama remained mute, which was in striking contrast to 2008, when his campaign vigorously complained about the then-right wing Canadian government's alleged anti-Obama activity. Ditto for then-Prime Minister David Cameron's British government four years earlier. In the summer of 2012, Cameron, another longtime Obama acolyte, publicly endorsed and campaigned with Obama, who shared Cameron's liberal views on many social issues, as well as on foreign aid and climate change. Accordingly, until Election Day, Cameron logically feared a less-than-special relationship with Washington should the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, win the White House. Following President Obama's reelection victory on November 6, 2012, Cameron's Downing Street staff popped the champagne corks and literally partied through the night. Nevertheless, no matter how logical the intervention from the external actor's perspective, it is understandable that Americans do not approve of other governments meddling in their domestic politics. All of which brings us to Obama's hypocrisy about Russian efforts. During the Arab Spring six years ago, President Obama and Hillary Clinton pushed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, America's longstanding Arab ally, from office to usher in a ‘democratic' revolution. That revolution resulted in the election of a deeply illiberal president, Mohamed Morsi, the Obama-backed Islamist leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist-supporting organization. In April 2106, Obama visited London during the United Kingdom's referendum campaign on her EU membership. The American President told the British people that they should vote to remain in the EU. He economically threatened Britons. He warned that the UK would be at the "back of the queue" in any trade deal with the United States if the country chose Brexit, that is, to leave the EU. A Democracy Institute poll taken shortly after his intervention found that Obama's lecturing of the British electorate went down very badly with most voters. Our poll found that 60 percent considered it inappropriate for Obama to express a preference for how they should vote in the referendum. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder US Intel Report Confirms WikiLeaks Data on DNC, Clinton Contain No ForgeriesAccording to a new Rasmussen poll, American voters think their intelligence agencies have their own political agenda. Those intelligence agencies say that Russian government-ordered hackers found and leaked damaging internal Democratic party emails to help Trump's candidacy. WikiLeaks made public the embarrassing internal Democratic Party emails, and the organization's founder, Julian Assange, insisted Russia was not involved. These very same intelligence agencies also maintain that there is no evidence Russian efforts made any difference in the final outcome. However, there is evidence that Obama's efforts to influence the outcome of the respective British and Egyptian elections made a substantial, and a substantively negative, difference. The Democracy Institute's final Brexit poll, which was the only public poll to correctly forecast both the winning side and the victory margin, found that Obama's intervention on behalf of the Remain campaign backfired. In fact, it may have made a crucial difference to the final outcome. The poll found that Obama's intervention influenced five percent of voters to support Brexit, a number greater than the Leave campaign's margin of victory. Obama's earlier foolish decisions — first, to wash his hands of Mubarak and, second, to trumpet Morsi as Egypt's savior — had disastrous economic, political, and security consequences. To this day, across Egypt and throughout the Middle East, Arab Muslims and non-Muslims alike pay a steep price for the Obama administration's "Washington knows best" interventionist instincts. Obama's diplomatic double standard is straightforward. A devotee of global governance, he believes in meddling in other countries' politics to advance his own ideological vision and enforce his own sense of right and wrong. Yet, he is vehemently opposed to external interventions in American politics that threaten his own image or legacy. Today, Russia is Exhibit A in this clear-cut case of presidential hypocrisy. _ The author of the article Patrick Basham directs the Democracy Institute (www.democracyinstitute.org) and authored the strategic handbook, Scared of US!

Did the UK sanction and kick out US diplomats for that of course not so how can Obama justify his hypocrisy, simply he cant 6 more days 6 more days. Reply Adrienne Adonis 11:59 14.01.2017 | 3 | Edit | Delete The democrats are pissed off about the WIKILEAKS emails which proved how corrupt they truly are. Their corruption was exposed with partnering with fake news medias like CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC, Washinton times, New York Times, Politico, Salon..... So the Dems are just mad about their corruption exposed to the world. Now that they know their corruption has been revealed, notice how they now expose themselves in wanting to delegitimize trumps election and they don't care about how the public views them now. Since they are now exposed as being political demons they don't hide this fact anymore. Notice how trump did not want to take any questions from fake news expert CNN. This is the way it's going to be with trump. He won't play nice guy to the fake news media. This is something the fake news people are not used to. Trump exposes what they truly are on national television and is now embarrassing them for once. Reply KnightRdr877 12:52 14.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete At least Russia is honest enough to admit it ... everyone does it. When Gadaffi was killed in Libya, what was it Hillary said: We came, we saw, he died!" Just because everyone does it, doesn't make it right. But such is the disgusting aspects of life in the world. It's all about money and power ... stealing each other's resources ... the everyday person just wants a good salary, food on the table, and a little peace and quiet in their lives. It's the rich and powerful who want it all and to Hell with the little people. That's who we should be at war with: the globalists who want to destroy everyone. And I'm sure even their puppets are expendable, though they don't realize it. The poor saps who riot in the streets, and who really have no clue as to why or who is pulling their strings.

New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 01/13/2017 — SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation and network function virtualization (NFV) are two separate networking technologies that are becoming backbone of any communication network now-a-days. These technologies provide ease in operating a communication network. While SDN facilitates a telecom operator to reduce the network complexity and bring down the overall management cost, NFV makes a particular network completely software agnostic. Enterprises, cloud service providers, and telecommunication service providers are biggest beneficiaries of this. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12835 In telecommunication sector, there is a lot of margins pressure on service providers, due to the changing needs of consumers such as data consumption and usages of OTT services. Conventional networks of service providers are not capable to handle this particular demand from consumers. That's why they are reconfiguring their network with the help of SDN and NFV technologies, in order to manage the challenges of traffic explosion and increase the average revenue per user (ARPU). Global SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in Telecom Network Transformation Market: Drivers and Challenges The major reason behind the adoption of SDN and NFV by service providers in their network transformation is because SDN and NFV technologies are synergetic and they offer improved programmability, faster service enablement, and most importantly lower down the overall CAPAEX and OPEX for the service providers. SDN and NFV provide a complete digital network that is essential to increase customer satisfaction level. SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation emerged as paradigm that has potential to transform service providers' networks by delivering cloud style nimbleness and innovation. The communication network telecom service providers are generally more complex, multilayer, and have variety of users that require high network availability and performance. As compared to data centers, a more stringent set of requirements will need to be met, in order to deploy SDN and NFV in these network. Global SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in Telecom Network Transformation Market: Segmentation SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation in telecom network transformation market can be segmented on the basis of component, technology, and region. Component category include software and different types of services such as professional services and managed services. On the basis of technology, the market can be segmented into SDN and NFV. Region wise, the Market can be segmented into North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Japan, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Middle East & Africa. A TOC of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/12835 Cisco System Inc. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM Corporation, Juniper Networks, Pica8, Inc., Intel Corporation, and Big Switch Networks, Inc. are some of the big players of global SDN and NFV technology in telecom network transformation market.

It's a private residence in an. Government residence not a lot of people are able to. Inside warehouse. Said this is the first time that we. About not only. I'm Kate Snow. Moviegoing. He street all clear sounds like you're saying that its First Act had. I didn't come to eat that it would. Source of that favorite at very great question. So I think it explain. 1837 biggest player and we moved into the warehouse and any statin. The warehouse up until the 1940s and her. Roosevelt so. There's out but he story behind how presidents used to entertain their foreign heads of states are typically used state in the White House. And in so doing several visits service to church hill visited. President Roosevelt meaning. During those times. He was not sort of appear in the middle of the night several tanks in the morning after Chinese friends that they're trying to disturb the president for no late night chats and. So First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt Island society that she had. She talked to the president that we we really heating gas house that's separate from the residence for itself. President resident still close that led him. Talk to an air but I think it's just where and guess where the line tax protests. They did in its right now today Christine Brennan State Department. Protocol. Your answers just that she four heads of state. So basically. Winston Churchill was back house cats that now. Well he. He loved president Roosevelt so he was. When he tapped constant conversation and talk about the issue at hands. They thought that they would anymore comfort level where better reader. In this state crossed street it would have their own right. Quarters and it would look. Story that Allen or Rumsfeld actually intercepted and I'll ask that I had grants can you tell. Our goal from what we know from just you know stories Intel's. There was there was that renting and threatening to state. And that one point in the opening night specifically to which that was injured when of his State's plan that's part of the story goes that she's she stopped. So it's true children entering the bedrooms and the president needs resonated so I think that that's throwing an active in the last call for a time efficiently. Purchase new residents work and state here. Okay innings in the warehouse I'll sit hat. Actual role to play for a few other presidents act even before. It was the gas house keeps us media a couple of highlights and you know in June that. Our Andy Jackson in fact that's. Originally supplied Frances Preston. C because.

Anytime. Anywhere. Oops: Anti-Hacking Company Gets Hacked Big Time By Gary Robbins PUBLISHED: JANUARY 13 2017 There was a fresh reminder Thursday that virtually everyone is vulnerable to hackers -- even a mobile forensics company that's familiar with all of their tricks. The Israeli firm Cellebrite, known for hacking mobile phones for police agencies around the world, confirmed that it suffered a 900GB data breach. That's roughly the amount of data contained in 177,000 emails. The hacker reportedly shared the data with Motherboard, a website that has been exploring whether Cellebrite's rapid phone-cracking technology has been used in questionable ways. "U.S. law-enforcement agencies have invested heavily in the tech, but Cellebrite may have also sold its wares to authoritarian regimes with abysmal human-rights records, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, according to a large cache of data obtained by Motherboard," the website said Thursday. "The revelations raise questions around Cellebrite's choice of customers, whether it vets them and what policies, if any, are in place to stop Cellebrite's technology from being used against journalists or activists." In a statement Thursday, Cellebrite did not address Motherboard's assertions. It instead focused on the breach, saying hackers had hit a "legacy database" and that it had migrated to a new user-accounts system. "Presently, it is known that the information accessed includes basic contact information of users registered for alerts or notifications on Cellebrite products and hashed passwords for users who have not yet migrated to the new system. To date, the company is not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident; however, my.Cellebrite account holders are advised to change their passwords as a precaution." Cellebrite is just the latest in a string of seemingly cyber-secure companies and institutions that have gotten attacked by hackers. In the United States, the victims include the National Security Agency and the Defense Department. In December, Yahoo announced that the accounts of 1 billion of its email users had been hacked. "In our world, there is no such thing as absolute security," said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist for Intel Security in Santa Clara. "It's common for the bad guys to target security companies to show that every company is vulnerable to attack." In the Cellebrite case, the company's customers "should be on the alert for phishing and spearphishing attacks in which the hackers attempt to use deception to obtain even more sensitive information. Given the international arena in which Cellebrite operates and the fact that they provide services to law enforcement, it is indeed ironic that one of their web servers has been hacked," said Beth Givens, executive director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse organization in San Diego. The newly hacked data could be harnessed in various ways, said Tony Gauda, chief executive of ThinAir, a security firm in Palo Alto. "If (the hackers) have a deeper understanding of the technology, it could be used to detect or defeat Cellebrite's forensics, which could impact future trials because the data is no longer unlockable. Since usernames and passwords were taken, it can be used to dox the people that log into the accounts -- which could be undercover agents. It's a significant breach." The word "dox" refers to placing private information, notably about specific individuals, on the Internet. "The real implication of the Cellebrite breach is related to the discussion regarding law-enforcement access to data in mobile (and other) devices, and whether systems must provide a technical means to obtain such data," said Clifford Neuman, director of the Center for Computer Systems Security at the University of Southern California. "Those in favor of such mandated back doors will tell us that we should not be concerned about such capabilities because the data will only be accessible for legitimate law-enforcement purposes. This hack, and the potential unauthorized access to forensic data, highlights that such data might end up accessed for other than such purposes," Neuman said. "Additionally, disclosure of some of Cellebrite's customer organizations tells us who else might obtain such capability to access our protected data." © 2017 San Diego Union-Tribune under contract with NewsEdge.

Heart Device Security Flaw Seen Next Article > EPA Accuses Fiat Chrysler of Cheating on Emissions By Tom Krisher and Michael Biesecker PUBLISHED: JANUARY 12 2017 The U.S. government is accusing Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had issued a "notice of violation" to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee [seen here] and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action. "Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle's engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe," said Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance. Fiat Chrysler quickly issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. EPA said it will continue to investigate the "nature and impact" of the eight software functions identified through its testing. Regulators were not yet defining the software as so-called "defeat devices" intended to cheat on government emissions tests. However, the agency said that numerous discussions with Fiat Chrysler over the last year had not produced any suitable explanation for why the company had failed to disclose the software, which regulators said caused the vehicles to emit less pollution during testing than during regular driving. EPA officials said Fiat Chrysler may be liable for civil penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. The EPA is investigating whether the auxiliary emission control devices constitute "defeat devices," which are illegal because they turn off pollution controls. "This is a clear and serious violation of the Clean Air Act," Giles said. "When companies break the law, Americans depend on EPA to step in and enforce." Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that its emissions control systems "meet the applicable requirements." The company said it was disappointed with the EPA's action and intends to work with the incoming Trump administration to present its case. Fiat Chrysler said it spent months giving information to the EPA to explain its emissions technology and proposed a number of actions including software changes to address the agency's concerns. Fiat Chrysler's shares fell more than 16 percent after the news was announced to $9.29. The announcement comes one day after Fiat rival Volkswagen pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges related to widespread cheating involving emissions tests with its "Clean Diesel" line of vehicles. Six high-ranking VW executives have been charged in the scandal. VW agreed to pay a record $4.3 billion penalty for cheating on emissions tests. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge.

Some are names you’d know, from big fund companies, that have grown to prominence—most notably, the top-notch $93 billion Vanguard Wellington, launched in July 1929. The $4.7 billion Pioneer fund, launched in February 1928, has a much less stellar performance history, but is under new management. And we can’t ignore the very first mutual fund, the solid, $6 billion Massachusetts Investors Trust, founded in July 1924. But there are a handful of smaller,...

Is the Smartphone Already Obsolete? By Evan Dashevsky January 13, 2017 10 Comments Modern smartphones have had a good run, but the next big technological paradigm might already be here. Revolutions are only relevant until the next revolution comes along. Over the past decade, the smartphone revolution has fundamentally upended daily life. Walk through any public space and you will find people of all backgrounds transfixed by pocket-sized, rectangular obelisks. These little wonder slabs magically connect us to the rest of humanity and are personal windows into the digital ghost dimension that flows beneath civilization's surface. This revolution has been quite a process to watch unfold—and it all happened in the relative blink of an eye. So it shouldn't be too difficult to imagine how the next big thing could come along and upend everything just as quickly. The smartphone era turns 10 this year, but the next great form factor may be ready to take its place. Perhaps that sounds like an absurd notion? Don't just take my word for it—look at where Big Tech is placing its bets for the future. Rise of the Hive Mind Ten years ago this month, Steve Jobs took the stage at Macworld to announce the iPhone. Under his second tenure at Apple, the company had already managed the twin masterstrokes of reimagining consumer hardware design and reinventing the music industry. This new undertaking, however, would prove transformative. Despite its name, the iPhone's chief purpose was never making iCalls—it was untethering the Internet. There were devices that called themselves smartphones before 2007 as there were mobile devices that could bring users online. But the iPhone was the first device to strike the right balance of technology and humanity to make the platform worth using. The first-generation iPhone introduced the masses to the concept of computing everywhere. Following that breakthrough, the Internet would join people at the dinner table, while walking the dog, in line at the post office, while watching TV, while running for the presidency, and in the bathroom. Never not be on camera or online. If a time traveler from the mid-90s arrived in 2010, they'd find themselves in an era where no bit of knowable information—or social contact—was out of reach; the hive-intelligence was always present. Not to get all Singularity on you, but mobile tech has represented a major step towards our inevitable melding with the digital world. In the 10 years since the iPhone's debut, smartphones have become fixtures of everyday life. A 2015 Pew Research study found that 86 percent of US adults owned smartphones, including a majority of adults who earned less than $30,000 annually. In fact, for 13 percent of adults in this bottom economic tier, smartphones are the primary way they get online, as a decent midrange smartphone on a discount mobile plan is more affordable than purchasing a laptop and home Internet access. Smartphone prices have fallen while features expand. Many phone cameras can rival DSLRs, there are devices that legitimately boast all-day battery life, and mobile processing power can match that of laptops from only a few years back. Looking forward, smartphones are beginning to flirt with UIs they weren't original intended for, like virtual and augmented reality; and they're even beginning to utilize advanced applications like artificial intelligence. This is where things begin to look familiar. Just as when advancements in a few once-unrelated technologies allowed modern smartphones to come into existence in the 2000s, a new technological convergence appears to be taking shape. In fact, I would argue that the next great form factor is already here. Time for Phone to Phone Home Fast forward to 2017, and it feels almost quaint that we are still accessing our virtual world through palm-sized rectangles. As everything around us inches towards seamlessness (from smart locks to Amazon Go), it seems strange that we still need to physically reach into our pockets to fish out our little friends, unlock the screen, and navigate to the right app just to check our email. I hope I'm not coming off as too #FirstWorldProblem precious here, but in a world surrounded by silky smooth automation, using a smartphone to complete basic tasks is beginning to feel clunky and garish. Smartwatches have attempted to smooth the transition between the physical and virtual worlds. But their tiny interface is a poor window to the rich virtual universe. Personally, I want to easily control my gadgets through voice or gesture and instantly be whisked away to the virtual domain of my choosing without having to touch a phone. But I also want to have some privacy so that not every lookie-loo in gawking distance can see where I choose to spend my virtual time (if I want to catcuh up on The Bachelor during my commute, that's my own business, not the stranger's next to me on the subway). Why would you need a phone, when you could do this? As it turns out, this technology actually already exists—be it in a primordial form. Microsoft's HoloLens projects virtual images (a.k.a. holograms) onto a faceplate in front of the user and allows them interact with them in three dimensions. So, if there's a hologram of an animated dinosaur, the user can walk around it IRL to check it out from all angles. They can also place a virtual video screen in an arbitrary location in mid-air and and view it from different perspectives. HoloLens allows users to construct a virtual, explorable environment or walk through a virtual world created by others. That's an amazing new medium. Microsoft is far from the only one attempting to break into the "mixed reality" facetech biz. The secretive (and controversial) Florida-based start-up Magic Leap has garnered significant financial backing from various Silicon Valley VCs. Likewise, Intel says untethered "Project Alloy" VR headsets (with front-facing sensors for AR functionality) will arrive by year's end. Even Apple is rumored to be partnering with Carl Zeiss to build some kind of "smart glasses" (which are hopefully more successful than Google Glass). I should note that these devices are by no means polished, consumer-ready products (HoloLens only has three hours of battery life, for example). But man, is it cool! After taking HoloLens for a test drive, I can imagine how Steve Jobs and company must have felt trying the multi-touch display that would underpin the iPhone UI and seeing the possibilities that lay ahead. Anyone can pick up their own HoloLens Developers' Edition for not-inconsiderable $3,000 price tag (but you really shouldn't do that unless you're a developer or happen to be overburdened by too much money). That's an undeniably steep price, but keep in mind the original consumer-ready iPhone retailed for $499 for the 4GB model—that's about $585 in today's dollars, or slightly more than the current price for an unlocked (and far brawnier) 32GB iPhone 6s. The price of HoloLens or other facetech will almost certainly come down with time, just as the quality will go up. There is ONE advantage that smartphones have over this new facetech; they don't require people to don some bulky, Daft Punk-esque headgear, which can look somewhat ridiculous: See, ridiculous. One of two things will have to happen for this new form factor to take off: 1) Engineers will need to figure out a way to shrink it to a size no larger than a pair of glasses, or 2) Society will have to get used to people wearing ridiculous things on their faces. Let's evaluate the second option first: The idea that society might bend to technology has happened before—remember the eye rolls that Bluetooth earpieces used to get? Still, the current state of face-mounted tech is particularly obstructive and they can prove problematic for anyone with hair (I'm not in that club, but I feel for y'all). A Project Alloy version of "merged reality." The second scenario depends on how quick engineers can work their magic. In the show Black Mirror, computer interfaces are implanted in users' eyeballs, thus obliterating the barrier between Man and Matrix. We're probably still a ways off from that (though people are trying!), but shrinking this tech to something the size of a pair of glasses is a real possibility. It's just a matter of when. There are a lot of talented engineers out there who routinely turn science fiction into reality (and the tech companies that employ them can be particularly motivated when they catch whiff of a potential financial windfall). Related Look! 7 Cool Things You Can See and Do With the Microsoft HoloLens Look! 7 Cool Things You Can See and Do With the Microsoft HoloLens I don't know if HoloLens, Magic Leap, or even Apple will be the one to successfully make the public comfortable with placing the Internet on their face. But as an observer of how technology has evolved over the past 20 years, I can't help but notice that the trend lines all seem to be pointing in the same direction. It might be later this year; it might be a few years down the road. But I can't imagine that the facetech era is too far away. Once this new form factor takes on its final, consumer-ready appearance, the small magic rectangular device in your pocket will begin to look outdated mighty quick. Perhaps in the future, we will see retro-loving hipsters insist on the virtue of carrying some kind of handcrafted artisanal smartphone around ("the Internet just works better that way," or some such nonsense), but most people will find the utility and overall future-coolness of this new platform. The smartphone has had a good run, but even this most ubiquitous of technologies will, at some point, find itself atop the growing pile of obsolete revolutions.

The work on the gadget, which revolutionized the industry, was carried out in complete secrecy. Even now, many details of the smartphone development remain unclear. The veil of secrecy over the history of Apple's first smartphone was lifted by the famous insider Sonny Dickson. In a video published on his YouTube channel, he demonstrated two iPhone prototypes, the P1 and P2, showing different approaches to the iOS interface. Two different teams at Apple Inc. worked on these projects: one was led by Tony Fadell, the former Senior Vice President of the iPod Division, while Scott Forstall, the then-leader of Mac development within the company, headed the other one. Fadell's version was based around controlling the new device via a click wheel like in the iPod. The interface looked pretty much like the player's firmware, too. "The iPhone P2 is what came to be known as the original selling model of the iPhone, paving the foundation of where we are today, 10 years in the future," Sonny Dickson wrote in the description to the video. Forstall's prototype was closer to the Mac OS X graphical operating system. © REUTERS/ Benoit Tessier iPhone Fever: 7 Crazy Things Apple Fans Did to Get iPhonesSecrecy was unbelievably strict. Jobs promised to fire anyone who revealed Apple's plans. Developers reported to him twice a month in a tiny room with no windows. Sometimes paranoia was clearly evident. Fadell almost incurred the wrath of Jobs, forgetting the iPhone prototype in a plane. Luckily, a special search team managed to find the secret gadget in two hours, but it seemed like an eternity to those Apple employees who knew about the incident, Fadell told the BBC. According to Fadell, Jobs had the idea of turning the iPod into the iPhone, and drove the team hard towards this end. The touch-sensitive wheel was going to become a virtual one, and it would disappear when viewing full screen videos and pictures. Jobs did not stand for failure, and when the team had difficulties implementing the dial in this prototype, he sent them away until they could come back to him with a solution. Altogether, there were some 17 different concepts, Fadell revealed in an interview to The Verge. In one of them, Jobs offered to put a set of buttons on the dial, like in the Nokia 3650. Fadell knew it was a waste of time, but Jobs insisted on trying everything. © Flickr/ Andrew Currie Nokia 3650 Meanwhile, Forstall, whose concept turned into what would be the company's actual iPhone, worked on a Mac computer with a touchscreen. However, the most contentious issue was the implementation of the keyboard. Jobs dreamed of a touch input, although the physical keys, such as the BlackBerry had, were considered a benchmark. This was argued over for four months. © REUTERS/ Kim Hong-Ji/File Gadgets on Fire: Most Scandalous Recalls of IT-Products in History"Sometimes stupid things only seem stupid at first, but if you break through, it actually becomes smart. Like, ‘Oh, everyone would want to type on a hardware keyboard, no one wants to type on glass.' Those kinds of things. You had to keep pushing people so that their first knee-jerk reaction isn't the answer," Fadell said. As for the characteristics of the first iPhone, the project adopted the iPod's hardware, although Intel had a chance to get an order for processors. According to the former president and CEO of Intel Paul Otellini, the chip maker refused Apple's offer. © Photo: Pixabay Forced to Sell 'Penis'? Apple’s iPhone 7 Faces Tricky Marketing in Hong Kong"There was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought," Otellini said, as quoted by The Atlantic. The iPhone was underestimated by many — only few believed that it would change the world. The media predicted the project would fail. However, in the third quarter of 2016, Apple set a record: its share of profits in the global smartphone market reached 91 %, which amounted to $8.5 billion. And the total revenue from the iOS ecosystem will exceed a trillion dollars, according to the company's website. ...

European Union leaders last July extended economic sanctions against Russia first imposed in 2014 after it annexed Crimea and went on to support a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine. The EU last year also extended travel bans and asset freezes covering about 150 people and 37 entities, including Tkachev. A spokeswoman for the German ministry of agriculture played down the significance of the invitation by Germany, which in January 2015 refused to issue an entry visa to Tkachev. "Invitations were sent to all G20 members and Russia is a G20 member," Christina Wendt told a regular government news conference in Berlin on Friday. The Russian agriculture ministry confirmed in a statement on Friday that Tkachev will attend the Jan. 22 meeting. It said Tkachev would hold bilateral meetings with G20 counterparts.

Folsom, CA and St. Louis MO (PRWEB) January 13, 2017 Apeiron Data Systems and World Wide Technology (WWT) announced today they have finalized a global partnership to market and sell the ADS1000, the world’s only native NVMe over Ethernet storage solution. Released in October 2016, the ADS1000 gives WWT a strategic advantage in the Big Data and IoT markets. Apeiron passes 100% of the NVMe performance to the application, via a non-blocking storage switching infrastructure. This means the system scales in a 100% linear manner, making it possible to present years of data for real-time queries versus the typical 60-90 days. The performance and capacity of NVMe SSDs in combination with Apeiron’s NVMe storage network makes this possible. With its patented storage architecture, Apeiron’s system actually outperforms NVMe SSDs installed in servers. WWT spent more than one month validating the ADS1000 performance in their Advanced Technology Center (ATC), based in St. Louis, MO. WWT conducted side-by-side storage testing running Splunk® Enterprise, and found the ADS1000 provided at least a 7x query advantage over bare metal Splunk environments. The ingestion rate was at least 10x traditional architectures, resulting in an incredible 80% consolidation of hardware. The Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) audited these results and produced a white paper with details and technical specifications. That paper can be downloaded from http://www.apeirondata.com Scott Miller, WWT’s Sr. Director of Data Center said: “When we were introduced to Apeiron’s architecture we knew the performance and consolidation claims would need to be demonstrated and documented in an unbiased manner. Apeiron immediately shipped us a system containing multiple NVMe SSD suppliers to prove their ability to interoperate across suppliers. Once the testing began our security and analytics architecture teams were seeing ingestion and query results simply not possible with traditional architectures. WWT is excited to represent the ADS1000 product globally, and we believe it provides an excellent option for those customers demanding ultra-high performance and capacity.” Jeff Barber, Apeiron’s EVP of Global Sales & Marketing said: “Apeiron was excited when approached by such a large and successful solution provider. WWT had the resources and in-house expertise to conduct 24×7 qualification of our system against legacy storage architectures, proving the incredible consolidation and performance advantages of NVMe in multiple Splunk Enterprise environments. When the results were in, WWT approached Apeiron about a Reseller arrangement immediately. We believe having a global partner of this size will accelerate our growth and open new markets for Apeiron.” About Apeiron Data Systems: Apeiron provides the world’s only native NVMe over Ethernet storage solution. Based in Folsom, California, Apeiron addresses the growing demand for real-time analytics on massive data sets. The ADS1000 leverages commercial NVMe SSDs to provide bandwidth and performance not possible with traditional storage architectures. The ADS1000 offers a controller-less architecture, is capable of scaling linearly to 1000’s of NVMe SSDs, and is ready for Intel’s 3D XPoint™ technology upon release. About World Wide Technology, Inc: World Wide Technology is a technology solution provider with more than $9 billion in annual revenue that provides innovative technology and supply chain solutions to large public and private organizations around the globe.

SHARES When I speak to some of the largest employers in the world, they unanimously agree that their biggest challenge is retention. Many employees, especially Millennials, are unable to see a career path at their current company, so they look outside of their company for other opportunities to advance. I believe the solution to a high attrition rate is career mobility, which is the movement of employees across different roles, either vertically or horizontally, within an organization. In a study by Futurestep, 87 percent of companies believe that internal mobility programs would definitely help with retention, yet only one third have these programs. Even the companies that have mobility programs aren't good at effectively communicating their talent needs and fail to keep updated records of employee skills. Some managers worry about letting one of their employees move into a new role on a different team. Managers who try to block these employees frustrate workers. So, instead of looking at new roles within their company, workers search outside of it and leave when the next opportunity presents itself. As a result, the manager has to replace good, ambitious workers, which is costly and time intensive and affects productivity. Why not work with employees instead? Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Intel employees walk by a sign as they enter their office in Santa Clara, California. The topic of career mobility is more important today than in years past because the competition for top talent is increasing as our economy has recovered. The BLS reports that the unemployment rate today is five percent, which is down from 9.5 percent back in 2009. 76 percent of employees are looking for or open to a new job. Companies that want to increase their retention rate need to become more fluid, help employees build internal career paths and create cultures where managers are supportive, not restrictive. A new study by Future Workplace and Cisco links career mobility to organizational success. The study found that companies that embrace internal career mobility increase employee engagement (49%) improve employee productivity (39%) and improve employee teamwork (39%). Companies that have mobility programs are also more likely to be considered a "best place to work" by their employees. In order to create an effective talent mobility program, you need to focus on three improvements: Internal hiring, flexibility and training by project. How to keep your best employees from quitting, according to the CEO of Chevron First, companies need to develop a culture that embraces internal hiring, where employees are given the first opportunity to apply for roles over external candidates. When employees feel that they are empowered to apply for other roles and advance within your company, they are more likely to choose that option. A study by Future Workplace and Saba found that 66 percent of employees would first look at open positions at their current company before looking elsewhere. By hiring internal candidates first, it boosts moral and gives talent a chance to grow, while saving you money from finding and training an external candidate. Boston Globe | Getty Images The letter 'f' stands in a corner of the Facebook offices in Cambridge, Mass. Second, it's essential to promote flexibility at your company in order to remain competitive as an employer. In a recent global study with Randstad, we found that the top benefit that Gen Z workers and Millennials want is flexibility. Employees are expected to be reachable outside of the office by phone or email and the 9-to-5 workday no longer exists. Aside from telecommuting and flexible schedules, more companies should allow employees to do work outside of their job description. An example of this is Google's 20% program, which prevents employees from having to do the same projects everyday and allows them to be more creative.

Third, companies should focus on training employees by assigning them new projects so they are challenged and more engaged in their work. For instance, Intel boasts an employee development tool called DOT, which connects talent to short-term needs to match development goals. If you're in the accounting department but are interested in taking on a marketing project, you can apply for it without giving up your current job. This way, you can learn, and grow your network, in a different department with little risk to your manager. In the Randstad study, we found that both Gen Z workers and Millennials agree that the most effective training program is cross-functional projects. Career mobility will continue to become more relevant as the war for talent heats up in 2017 and beyond. Companies that create programs around it will increase their retention and employee satisfaction rates, while those that don't will suffer productivity and financial losses.

Tert.am ՀԱՅ РУС ENG Weather in Yerevan +33°C day +21°C night World weather report Rates GBP 633.34 EUR 527.77 GEL 203.35 RUB 7.46 USD 476.41 ArmeniaRegionWorldBusinessScience/techCultureArmsport.amLifestyleEventPress digestInterview - Press digest World Business Event Science/Tech Culture Sport Lifestyle Interview Armenia Region About us ‘Any violence simply postpones NK conflict settlement’ - Richard Hoagland 18:00 • 13.01.17 Tweet Richard Hoagland, the new U.S. Co-Chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, is looking forward to a regional visit. In an interview with ARMENPRESS, Mr. Hoagland mentioned his intention to work closely with his fellow Minsk Group Co-Chairs to encourage the sides to engage constructively in finding a way forward. - Your Excellency Mr. Hoagland, as the new U.S. Co-Chair of the OSCE Minsk Group, what approaches do you have in terms of the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict? - I intend to work closely with my fellow Minsk Group Co-Chairs to encourage the sides to engage constructively to find a way forward. For my part, I know that the U.S. Government remains committed to a peaceful settlement through the mediation of the Co-Chair countries. - The Minsk Group Co-Chairs avoided making addressed assessments in a statement released on January 9, regarding the December 29 Azerbaijani incursion attempt on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border near the Armenian village of Chinari. To what extent do unaddressed announcements contribute to the settlement of the conflict? - The Minsk Group Co-Chairs stand by the January 9 statement calling on the sides to abstain from the use of force and strictly observe the agreements reached during summits in Vienna and St. Petersburg in 2016. Any violence simply postpones a settlement and prolongs the suffering of all the peoples in the region. The ultimate goal should be peace and prosperity for ALL peoples in the region. - Do you find it possible for the representatives of Nagorno Karabakh to be included in the negotiations process as a full party to negotiations? - I, personally, do not foresee any radical change in the near future. I want to emphasize that the Co-chairs have stated before that we understand the importance of hearing views from all sides of the conflict, including Nagorno-Karabakh. How to incorporate these views into the negotiations is something the Co-Chairs continue to discuss with the sides. - Are the Co-Chairs planning a visit to the region in the upcoming months? - My fellow Co-Chairs and I are consulting closely to find the most appropriate time for our next visit to the region. I, personally, very much look forward to such a visit so that I can hear all views. - When is a meeting between the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan planned to take place - The Co-Chairs are prepared to work with the parties in any way that can bring about a lasting settlement. We continue to encourage the Presidents and Foreign Ministers to meet at the earliest opportunity to continue the important discussion on key issues, including the importance of respecting the ceasefire and taking steps towards fully implementing decisions taken in Vienna and St. Petersburg.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — President-elect Donald Trump has returned to some of his campaign rhetoric by issuing a Twitter message on Friday in which he called his former rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, as being "guilty as hell."

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 13 января 2017 г. Trump’s comment comes after Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Thursday his office was opening an investigation into the actions of the FBI prior to the 2016 US election. Horowitz said the investigation would examine FBI Director James Comey’s decision to disclose the Bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton in the criminal probe of whether she intended to break US laws by utilizing a private email server during her tenure as US secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. © AP Photo/ Matt Rourke Allegations That Russia Has Compromising Intel on Trump 'Pulp Fiction' - KremlinComey reopened the investigation just days before the November 8 election based on discovering new evidence on a laptop belonging to Clinton top aide’s husband Anthony Weiner. Horowitz also said his office will investigate whether an FBI deputy director, whose wife received financial support in her state election from a Clinton ally, and the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general, who was close to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, should have recused themselves from the investigation.

Hillary did not engender trust by the very nature of her recklessness to all things big and small. People feared her insanity was visibly worsening and couldn't trust her that she wouldn't start a nuclear war and wipe out the US by her reckless actions. To have put up such a candidate was purely playing the feminist card which did not wash with the majority of intelligent thinking females. Never before have we seen in history such a corrupted person as candidate lacking so much credibility put up to serve on the basis of a media black out to all other candidates and over a billion dollars spent from donations from other nations wanting continued unbridled support from the US government. Conversely never in history has there been such a powerful example of the little man rising to defeat the Ogre it was the peoples victory 120 million of Trumps own money and a superb foil to mainstream media brought the Don home. Lets all hope he lives up to his promises for the people and by the people and restores Democracy back and removes fascism from all realms it so inhabits. Good luck Trump Billions of people around the world are hoping and praying you stand by your word no more no less.

By Andrew Zarowny Start putting the champagne on ice! Just one more week till Trump Day! Yes! In just 7 days, President-Elect Donald J. Trump will take the oath of office and become the 45th President of the United States of America. While most American await this blessed event with great anticipation, the crazy Liberals are getting crazier. Even Barack Hussein Obama and his administration are still trying do ruin the country as much as possible. The latest outrage was Obama ending the decades old policy of ′Wet Foot, Dry Foot′ for Cuban refugees. Seems that Obama does not believe that Cubans should be running away from a Communist dictatorship, but, instead, should be running towards it. Or, at least, staying put in Cuba. By the way, what is with Obama first giving himself some sort of ′lifetime achievement′ medal, and yesterday giving a ′Medal of Freedom′ to Joe Biden? I guess Obama is not satisfied with having been given a Noble Peace Prize, even though he is the first U.S. president to have been at war everyday during his term in office. Perhaps Obama thinks he deserves his medal for releasing more violent criminals into the population than any other president? Or maybe because he increased the National Debt more than all other presidents combined? Meanwhile, the idiots in The Media are still going bonkers after getting trolled by 400-pound, Cheeto-munching Internet forum posters on 4chan.org, claimed to be Russian GRU and FSB agents. I saw an interview with Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who said something rather interesting. He explained that he has had many briefings by members of the ′Intelligence Community′, and that they usually are vague and not very specific. But, this latest briefing on the alleged Russian hacking was the most detailed and specific he has ever had. Hmm! I have to wonder if this is like the old Sherlock Holmes story, ″Silver Blaze″. The one about the race horse which went missing and how Holmes solved the case thanks to the ″dog that didn′t bark″. Makes me wonder if the reason this briefing was so specific and detailed because the Intel Community manufactured the whole thing? There is a lot of fishy stuff going on as the end of the Age of Obama draws near. Now the Justice Department Inspector General is going to investigate FBI Director Comey on his actions during the Hillary Clinton probe. However, the IG is not going to investigate Loretta Lynch for meeting with Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix, nor is he going to investigate the probe itself and why no charges were brought against Hillary? Yep, fishy, very fishy! Then we have another juicy item of fishiness. The Obama administration is warning allies, including Israel, not to share their intelligence with Donald Trump, as he may pass the info along to the Russians! Now this is simply the most brazen act of sour grapes I have ever seen! I cannot wait till Inauguration Day! Obama is the most vile, treacherous scumbag who has ever occupied the White House! There is no limit to his evilness. I know that there is a tradition of not conducting any criminal investigations of former presidents, but in Obama′s case, as well as for Bill and Hillary Clinton, Trump and Jeff Sessions have to reconsider for the sake of justice. Where is CNN and BuzzFeed on how Obama suddenly has the cash to buy three mansions? One of them being some $20 Million dollar estate in Hawaii? Did Obama′s blind-trust invest in bull sperm futures and stock and make a killing? I ask you! I have no idea what new lunacy we will see over the next seven days, but absolutely nothing would surprise me when it comes to the criminal actions of Barack Hussein Obama. He was a thug in Chicago, a corrupt senator in Illinois, engaged in criminal activity while a U.S. Senator in helping a former Iraqi Energy Minister escape from prison and seek asylum in Chicago. Bad enough that Obama lies about everything. There is no end to his evil ways. So, with just one week to go till Trump Day, I am keeping my eyes open and weapons at the ready. I am counting down the minutes, the seconds, until President Donald J. Trump takes office. Then, at long last, America will be saved from the mad man Obama, a.k.a. Barry Soetoro. Yes, Trump will turn the country around and Make America Great Again. But, if he really wants to ′Drain The Swamp′, Trump will need to deal with the legacy of corruption left behind by Obama and the Clintons. Only then we will have real justice in our nation and be respected by the world at large. For more REAL NEWS and views, follow Andrew Zarowny on Facebook, or on Twitter @mrcapitalist.

One Response to “One Week Till Trump Day!” 1 Sue Marie, Detroit Says: January 13th, 2017 at 10:00 am The Democrats have always been cozy with the Russians as long as I can remember. Ted Kennedy flow to Russia and got cozy with them in order to under mind Regan’s Administration. What the Democrats and Media have not learned is that many Americans are leaving the useful idiots ranks and are exposed to real news from difference outlets. Americans are learning the Mafia tactics the left (Democrat Party) have been doing since their formation.

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump is again denying allegations contained in a once-secret dossier prepared by a retired intelligence officer — and throwing in an attack on 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton for good measure. Apparently referring to reports that political opponents hired an ex-spy to do research on him, Trump tweeted early Friday: "It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued ... Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists." Documents that surfaced this week accused Trump of sexual and financial impropriety stemming from various projects in Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Russians of trying to influence the election by hacking Democrats close to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton — another topic of Trump's morning tweetstorm. Referring to the email investigation of Clinton, Trump tweeted: "What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell." He added that Clinton "lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!" Read more: USA TODAY Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect USA TODAY Justice IG to launch review into FBI handling of Clinton probe Reports show that the dossier compiled on Trump was done by a retired British intelligence operative working as a private investigator. It was presented to Trump by intelligence officials last Friday, a practice that, while unusual, happens if officials believe an elected official needs to know such information exists and could be used against him or her. While intelligence officials have denied leaking the dossier, Trump appeared to doubt that. He said documents were "probably ... released by 'Intelligence' even knowing there is no proof, and never will be."

USA TODAY NETWORK Donald Trump is again denying allegations contained in a once-secret dossier prepared by a retired intelligence officer — and throwing in an attack on 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton for good measure. Apparently referring to reports that political opponents hired an ex-spy to do research on him, Trump tweeted early Friday: "It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued ... Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists." Documents that surfaced this week accused Trump of sexual and financial impropriety stemming from various projects in Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Russians of trying to influence the election by hacking Democrats close to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton — another topic of Trump's morning tweetstorm. Referring to the email investigation of Clinton, Trump tweeted: "What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell." He added that Clinton "lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!" Read more: USA TODAY Intel chiefs briefed Trump, Obama on unverified, salacious allegations concerning Russia and president-elect USA TODAY Justice IG to launch review into FBI handling of Clinton probe Reports show that the dossier compiled on Trump was done by a retired British intelligence operative working as a private investigator. It was presented to Trump by intelligence officials last Friday, a practice that, while unusual, happens if officials believe an elected official needs to know such information exists and could be used against him or her. While intelligence officials have denied leaking the dossier, Trump appeared to doubt that. He said documents were "probably ... released by 'Intelligence' even knowing there is no proof, and never will be."

Andrew Dalton, @dolftown 01.13.17 in Personal Computing Comments 948 Shares Share Tweet Share Save REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Apple's latest MacBook Pros got plenty of mixed reviews, but the bugs with the laptop's battery life estimates were a bad ending to a tough year for Cupertino. Although Apple figured the machines would get a respectable a 10 hour battery life, independent tests from Consumer Reports showed wildly different results ranging from less than four hours to almost 20 hours, causing the group to pull their recommendation for the first time. While Apple put some of the blame on Intel's Skylake-based chips, a new software update has apparently fixed the issue to Consumer Reports' satisfaction. In an updated review, the group writes that the latest software update has addressed the issue. Using "the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year," Consumer Reports says, the three MacBook Pros they tested all performed well, "with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge." For the record, they tested both the Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar versions of the 13-inch model, as well as a 15-incher. The new average run times work out to 15.75 hours, 18.75 hours and 17.25 hours respectively. If you've already upgraded to one of Apple's newest laptops and you're wondering why your status bar still doesn't have a battery life estimate on it, then Consumer Reports notes that the update is still in Apple's Beta program, but it should roll out to all users in the the next few weeks. In the meantime, you'll just have to stick close to an outlet.

Market from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, January 13, 2017 ) According to Publisher, the Global Digital storage device Market is estimated at $1.64 billion in 2015 and is poised to reach $6.27 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 21.0%. The arrival of cloud computing has given rise to trends such as enterprise mobility, Big Data and analytics, which have created progressively more linked data ecosystems, and this is driving the demand for digital data storage capacity. Whereas, producing enough storage devices to hold the rapidly increasing rate is the major challenge posed by the market. The cloud has been regarded as a threat to digital storage devices market, but infact the increasing rates of cloud adoption will amplify the demand for the hard drives and solid state drives that comprise cloud storage, creating more opportunities for storage vendors. The Solid State Drive (SSD) market has seen a barb in growth, but Hard Disk Drives (HDD) sustains their dominance in the market. Technological advancements in both magnetic disks and heads will continue to aid enhancements in HDD recording. However, the come up of USB 3.0 specification for high-speed file transfer is anticipated to fuel the demand for USB flash drives in the coming years. Europe commanded the market globally. APAC is expected to emerge as the fastest growing region supported by spiralling use of entertainment services, strong economic growth and rapidly increasing SMBs in India and China.

A far cry from the usual state of affairs where the automotive world is way behind in terms of tech, in 2017 it seems that the collective car industry, rather than merely a few brave pioneers, has raised its game considerably.

According to the latest update, OpenAI, a non-profit company chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman have announced that they are releasing Universe integration with Grand Theft Auto.  ( YouTube/Typical Gamer ) Love the GTA 5 game? Enthusiastic about self-driving cars? Well, now anyone with a computer and copy of GTA 5 can develop an autonomous driving car. According to the latest update, OpenAI, a non-profit company chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman have announced that they are releasing Universe integration with Grand Theft Auto. It is developed and maintained by DeepDrive project, a platform that can turn GTA 5 into research arena. This can help improve the self-driving technology at much faster rate than it is done at present. As reported by Inverse, Jack Clark, Strategy and Communications Director said, "Setting up DeepDrive will take only 20 minutes with the help of Universe. A pre-trained AI that has seen about 21 hours of GTA driving will also be included in the Universe." GTA 5 has a vast terrain that can be used to test the self-driving car. GTA 5 has deserts, mountains, highways, and 257 cars to use. The date generated by using GTA 5 can be utilised in the real world. This is not the first time that GTA 5 will be used to test AI for autonomous driving technology. Earlier Intel has used the GTA 5 to test self-driving technology. But no one has ever released the modification to general public. DeepDrive was started in 2015 to configure GTA 5 and making changes so that it could be used in training Self-driving cars. With the integration of DeepDrive and Universe, researchers will have greater flexibility in testing. At present, one need an actual car to test the performance of self-driving cars. By using GTA 5 in testing the self-driving cars, there is no real threat to lives and on-road vehicles. Simulations such as increasing traffic, adding snow, etc. can all be tested with GTA 5. This integration will ease up the process of testing autonomous cars. It will also reduce the cost and time of testing. A benchmark measure that will enable researchers to compete with each other with their version of AI is under development and could be released soon.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the company broke the law by installing, but failing to disclose, the technology in more than 100,000 Jeeps and Dodge vehicles. The agency said the software caused higher nitrogen oxide levels. Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne said the firm had done nothing illegal. "There was never any intent of creating conditions that were designed to defeat the testing process. This is absolute nonsense," he added. Shares in Fiat Chrysler ended the day 10.3% lower in New York and closed 16% lower in Milan. The EPA said Fiat Chrysler could be liable for fines of about $44,500 per vehicle, which would mean a total of about $4.6bn (£3.8bn). According to the EPA, the 104,000 vehicles affected were 2014, 2015 and 2016 model years of the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV and Dodge Ram truck. Between "one-sixth and one-seventh" of the vehicles were sold in Europe, with the rest in the US, according to Fiat Chrysler. In a press conference, the EPA said at least eight types of emissions control software on the vehicles had not been disclosed to the agency. It also suggested some of the software appeared to make cars perform differently during emissions tests. "Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle's engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe," said EPA official Cynthia Giles. "All automakers must play by the same rules."   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 15:48 • 15/01 Vote buying not to influence results of Armenia parliamentary elections – sociologist 15:21 • 15/01 Icredible pictures of city-dweller-turned shepherd 14:42 • 15/01 Armenia parliamentary elections: serious political stake expected 14:27 • 15/01 Lufthansa says no evidence of bomb on board Eurowings plane landed in Kuwait 13:30 • 15/01 Ringling Bros circus to close 'Greatest Show on Earth' after 146 years 13:11 • 15/01 Import substitution is impossible in Armenia-like country – economist 12:50 • 15/01 Bahrain executes three Shia men over 2014 police killing 12:25 • 15/01 9 ISIL militants 'neutralized' in northern Syria 11:27 • 15/01 Azerbaijan continues ceasefire violations 10:50 • 15/01 Brazil prisoners beheaded in riot at Natal prison 10:33 • 15/01 Israel-Palestinian conflict: France holds world summit 17:51 • 14/01 Fifty Shades of Grey may be turned into a musical (video) 17:31 • 14/01 SpaceX rocket set to return to flight 17:15 • 14/01 Fruitless talks necessitate ‘divorce’ – Armenian politician on Nagorno-Karabakh 16:33 • 14/01 Criminal mindset responsible for genocide, not Turkish people 16:20 • 14/01 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalise divorce 16:03 • 14/01 Nagorno-Karabakh never seriously discussed in expert circles – analyst   15:42 • 14/01 Serena Williams reveals her excitement to plan wedding to fiancé Alexis Ohanian 15:26 • 14/01 OSCE/ODIHR hails electoral reforms in Armenia 15:04 • 14/01 We need to make Gyumri more business-friendly city – prime minister   14:35 • 14/01 Air raid targeting IS militant kills up to 30 in Iraqi city 14:27 • 14/01 Mkhitaryan offers insight into Liverpool clash 14:13 • 14/01 Jackson daughter 'incredibly offended' by new TV movie's portrayal of her father 14:02 • 14/01 Turkey remands foreigners over Istanbul attack 13:53 • 14/01 Armenian politician considers cooperation plans ahead of election 13:33 • 14/01 Fire erupts at Germany embassy in Yerevan 13:22 • 14/01 Garo Paylan speaks of Armenian Genocide in Turkish Parliament 13:08 • 14/01 Zhamanak: Armenia’s defense minister most favored candidate for future PM   12:36 • 14/01 Trump open to lifting Russian sanctions if 'we get along' 12:17 • 14/01 Azerbaijan shoots grenade fire on Karabakh frontline 19:32 • 13/01 Cyprus talks: Erdogan dismisses full Turkish troop withdrawal 19:02 • 13/01 Germany invites Russian minister on EU sanctions list to G20 meeting 18:25 • 13/01 Extraordinary images show 'light pillars' dancing above houses after sunshine and snow combine to create rare effect 18:00 • 13/01 ‘Any violence simply postpones NK conflict settlement’ - Richard Hoagland 17:15 • 13/01 Atheist man shocked to discover Jesus in Ikea bathroom door 17:04 • 13/01 Numerous reasons for poor 2016 budget performance – premier 16:40 • 13/01 Turkey offers citizenship to foreign property buyers 16:26 • 13/01 Mkhitaryan comes first, second and third in Man Utd Goal of the Month competition 16:05 • 13/01 IOC disqualifies Armenian weightlifter 15:56 • 13/01 Human Rights Watch criticizes Turkish authorities in new report 15:35 • 13/01 Turkish Parliament’s microphone worth €15,000 goes missing after brawl 15:20 • 13/01 No unacceptable decision on Nagorno-Karabakh can be made – Armenia’s premier 15:04 • 13/01 Our economy in 'grave yet manageable situation’ – premier 14:35 • 13/01 No alternative political agenda in Armenia – Styopa Safaryan 14:25 • 13/01 Government needs to ensure effective management of resources – premier 14:06 • 13/01 Lexus unveils Sports Yacht packing in 885 horsepower and oozing style 13:51 • 13/01 Civil servants’ salaries remain problem - premier 13:14 • 13/01 Armenia’s human rights record uneven in 2016 – report 13:02 • 13/01 Numerous problems in public administration system - Armenia’s premier 12:31 • 13/01 27 years after Baku pogroms many problems still unresolved – ex ombudsman 12:19 • 13/01 Fiat accused over emissions software 11:09 • 13/01 Moon is much older than thought, scientists find 10:46 • 13/01 Armenia needs developed infrastructures to boost tourism – economist 10:05 • 13/01 Omen star who played devil-child Damien faces jail for punching two cyclists in a road rage attack 09:53 • 13/01 Azerbaijan keeps Karabakh frontline under fire 09:28 • 13/01 Haykakan Zhamanak: Ex police chief aspires for emergency minister’s post 09:08 • 13/01 Turkey, Russia agree to coordinate strikes in Syria 08:48 • 13/01 US Vice President Joe Biden awarded trust medal 08:15 • 13/01 Syria army says Israel fires rockets at air base near Damascus 20:03 • 12/01 2017 economic growth more important, Armenian MP 19:30 • 12/01 Smile, you're on camera!

Ill-treatment in custody remained a persistent problem, and investigations have been ineffective. Other concerns include domestic violence, often perpetrated with impunity, violence, and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and unnecessary restrictions on access to pain medications for people with life-limiting illnesses. “In July, Armenian authorities used excessive force against peaceful protesters demonstrating support for a radical group opposed to the government, and assaulted journalists reporting on the demonstrations. Authorities arbitrarily detained dozens of protest leaders and participants, pressing unjustified criminal charges against them and denying some of them basic rights of detainees. Protests erupted after armed men from the radical opposition group, “Founding Parliament,” seized a police station in the capital Yerevan on July 17, killing one policeman and taking several hostages. Before the gunmen surrendered on July 31, public support for them and disaffection with the government grew into a protest movement. The protests were largely peaceful, with isolated incidents of violence from participants.” “On July 29, police fired stun grenades into peaceful crowds in the neighborhood of the seized police station, causing demonstrators to sustain first and second degree burns and fragmentation wounds. Police did not attempt less violent crowd control means, and did not make any meaningful effort to warn crowds to disperse or about their plans to use force.” “Police and unidentified people in civilian clothes acting with them, then charged towards the protesters, punching, kicking, and using wooden clubs and iron bars to beat some protesters, before detaining many of them,” reads the report.  The  document also addresses women’s and sexual minorities’ rights, and the palliative care problem in the country.

Development can help tourism secure considerable profit. Every country is unique; Armenia too, has its unique features, as well as specificities which require the right approach,” he said, commenting on a Russian newspaper’s recent report highlighting a record growth in tourism in the neighboring Georgia. What makes tourism less attractive in Armenia (apart from non-sufficiently developed infrastructures and absence of sea resorts) is the investment atmosphere, according to the Yeghuazaryan. “Armenia, objectively, cannot develop sea tourism, because it does not have a sea, but in other areas where the country has relative advantages, we see also subjective [factors] hampering development. Armenia is practically in a union [Eurasian Economic Union] which keeps off investors,” he noted. As for the government efforts to create a tourism commission, Yeghiazaryan said he doesn’t expect the move to raise the country’s advantages in terms of profitability.   “[The initiative] to create a commission was an institutional undertaking; I do not see any positive serious step which could develop the sector,” he said, stressing the importance also of the country’s image and its role on the international arena.   As major obstacles, the economist cited the unsettled Nagorno-Karabakh conflict which he said is a major risk for potential investors.   Liana Arakelyan Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 15:48 • 15/01 Vote buying not to influence results of Armenia parliamentary elections – sociologist 15:21 • 15/01 Icredible pictures of city-dweller-turned shepherd 14:42 • 15/01 Armenia parliamentary elections: serious political stake expected 14:27 • 15/01 Lufthansa says no evidence of bomb on board Eurowings plane landed in Kuwait 13:30 • 15/01 Ringling Bros circus to close 'Greatest Show on Earth' after 146 years 13:11 • 15/01 Import substitution is impossible in Armenia-like country – economist 12:50 • 15/01 Bahrain executes three Shia men over 2014 police killing 12:25 • 15/01 9 ISIL militants 'neutralized' in northern Syria 11:27 • 15/01 Azerbaijan continues ceasefire violations 10:50 • 15/01 Brazil prisoners beheaded in riot at Natal prison 10:33 • 15/01 Israel-Palestinian conflict: France holds world summit 17:51 • 14/01 Fifty Shades of Grey may be turned into a musical (video) 17:31 • 14/01 SpaceX rocket set to return to flight 17:15 • 14/01 Fruitless talks necessitate ‘divorce’ – Armenian politician on Nagorno-Karabakh 16:33 • 14/01 Criminal mindset responsible for genocide, not Turkish people 16:20 • 14/01 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalise divorce 16:03 • 14/01 Nagorno-Karabakh never seriously discussed in expert circles – analyst   15:42 • 14/01 Serena Williams reveals her excitement to plan wedding to fiancé Alexis Ohanian 15:26 • 14/01 OSCE/ODIHR hails electoral reforms in Armenia 15:04 • 14/01 We need to make Gyumri more business-friendly city – prime minister   14:35 • 14/01 Air raid targeting IS militant kills up to 30 in Iraqi city 14:27 • 14/01 Mkhitaryan offers insight into Liverpool clash 14:13 • 14/01 Jackson daughter 'incredibly offended' by new TV movie's portrayal of her father 14:02 • 14/01 Turkey remands foreigners over Istanbul attack 13:53 • 14/01 Armenian politician considers cooperation plans ahead of election 13:33 • 14/01 Fire erupts at Germany embassy in Yerevan 13:22 • 14/01 Garo Paylan speaks of Armenian Genocide in Turkish Parliament 13:08 • 14/01 Zhamanak: Armenia’s defense minister most favored candidate for future PM   12:36 • 14/01 Trump open to lifting Russian sanctions if 'we get along' 12:17 • 14/01 Azerbaijan shoots grenade fire on Karabakh frontline 19:32 • 13/01 Cyprus talks: Erdogan dismisses full Turkish troop withdrawal 19:02 • 13/01 Germany invites Russian minister on EU sanctions list to G20 meeting 18:25 • 13/01 Extraordinary images show 'light pillars' dancing above houses after sunshine and snow combine to create rare effect 18:00 • 13/01 ‘Any violence simply postpones NK conflict settlement’ - Richard Hoagland 17:15 • 13/01 Atheist man shocked to discover Jesus in Ikea bathroom door 17:04 • 13/01 Numerous reasons for poor 2016 budget performance – premier 16:40 • 13/01 Turkey offers citizenship to foreign property buyers 16:26 • 13/01 Mkhitaryan comes first, second and third in Man Utd Goal of the Month competition 16:05 • 13/01 IOC disqualifies Armenian weightlifter 15:56 • 13/01 Human Rights Watch criticizes Turkish authorities in new report 15:35 • 13/01 Turkish Parliament’s microphone worth €15,000 goes missing after brawl 15:20 • 13/01 No unacceptable decision on Nagorno-Karabakh can be made – Armenia’s premier 15:04 • 13/01 Our economy in 'grave yet manageable situation’ – premier 14:35 • 13/01 No alternative political agenda in Armenia – Styopa Safaryan 14:25 • 13/01 Government needs to ensure effective management of resources – premier 14:06 • 13/01 Lexus unveils Sports Yacht packing in 885 horsepower and oozing style 13:51 • 13/01 Civil servants’ salaries remain problem - premier 13:14 • 13/01 Armenia’s human rights record uneven in 2016 – report 13:02 • 13/01 Numerous problems in public administration system - Armenia’s premier 12:31 • 13/01 27 years after Baku pogroms many problems still unresolved – ex ombudsman 12:19 • 13/01 Fiat accused over emissions software 11:09 • 13/01 Moon is much older than thought, scientists find 10:46 • 13/01 Armenia needs developed infrastructures to boost tourism – economist 10:05 • 13/01 Omen star who played devil-child Damien faces jail for punching two cyclists in a road rage attack 09:53 • 13/01 Azerbaijan keeps Karabakh frontline under fire 09:28 • 13/01 Haykakan Zhamanak: Ex police chief aspires for emergency minister’s post 09:08 • 13/01 Turkey, Russia agree to coordinate strikes in Syria 08:48 • 13/01 US Vice President Joe Biden awarded trust medal 08:15 • 13/01 Syria army says Israel fires rockets at air base near Damascus 20:03 • 12/01 2017 economic growth more important, Armenian MP 19:30 • 12/01 Smile, you're on camera!

Harvey Spencer Stephens, 46, got out of his flash Audi RS6 to thump the men — smashing one of their helmets. He has admitted two counts of ABH and one of criminal damage after the assault on Toys Hill, near Westerham, Kent, on August 21 last year. Stephens became world famous when he took on the role of devil child Damien Thorn in the 1976 cult classic movie — where in one scene he circles demonically on a tricycle.

Web browsers aren’t always interesting. They have a task, a purpose, and don’t always see the sort of innovation that can be called “exciting”. Opera, which is now owned by a consortium of Chinese companies, has decided to liven things up. And right on cue, we have the Opera Neon, which is an experimental desktop browser for Windows and Mac computing devices, and focuses on minimalism and modern design cues as well as functionality. Also Read: Gateway to the world wide web Incidentally, this isn’t the first-time Opera has tried to make a second web browser along with the default Opera browser—sometime ago, they launched the Coast browser for iOS devices, which also had focused on minimalism and a clutter free browsing experience. Open Neon for the first time, and it becomes very clear that this isn’t the standard fare web browser, such as the likes of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, which you may have been using all along. The home screen has your favourite websites (these can be customized) as bubbles placed in such a way that it feels like they are floating around the screen. Your desktop background/wallpaper is visible, because the browser home screen is translucent. It might be time to change that default Windows or OS X wallpaper to something fancier, perhaps? A screen grab of Livemint website in Opera Neon browser. The stuff that you may be accustomed to seeing in a web browser, such as the bookmarks bar, the tab bar and add-ons, are not there. Instead of the tab bar, you get bubbles on the right side of the window. If you wish to keep multiple browser windows open at the same time, they can be made to share screen space as well. There is a media control panel as well, which lets you manage playback of media content that may be embedded in web pages. All in all, Neon seems quite refreshing and fun to use for a while. It is quite fast, the minimalism stands out and there is no doubt that this does have the basics in place which a lot of other web browser could do well to follow. However, it is far too early in the Neon’s development cycle, if we are to assume that Opera will persist with this, for you to switch to this as a default web browser for home or office use. The primary reason, at least on the MacBook Pro 2016 (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, OS X Sierra 10.12.2), is the battery life—15 minutes of using Neon saw a battery drain of as high as 20%. We really couldn’t pinpoint the reason, but the battery usage returned to its normal frugal self the moment we closed Neon and switched back to Safari. While this may be an isolated issue with this set of hardware, power users will miss certain other features. Presently, it doesn’t support extensions, the kind we are used to in the likes of the Google Chrome web browser. Secondly, the entire experience, though smooth, does pose a learning curve beyond a point. You will need to get used to the way tabs are handled, for example. And for a browser that Opera itself calls as experimental, we aren’t entirely sure if you should invest your time and energy in switching to Neon for the moment.

Moti Bassok Jan 13, 2017 6:38 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Israel’s merchandise trade deficit widened sharply last year, although it was only slightly ahead of its 2014 level, as exports declined and imports grew, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. The deficit reached 50.2 billion shekels ($13.1 billion at current exchange rates), compared with 30.2 billion in 2015, although only slight larger than the 49.4 billion gap in 2014. Nevertheless, it ended a three-year decline in the deficit. Imports, led by a surge of consumer good and capital equipment, climbed 4.8% last year to 249.8 billion shekels, the CBS said. Exports declined 4.1% to 199.6 billion shekels, with high-tech exports – the biggest category of Israeli sales abroad – taking an especially big hit. Tech exports were down 7.1% for the year, but there were signs of a revival in the sector in the final three months of the year, when they rose at a 12.1% annual rate, the CBS said. Israeli exports have been hurt by a strong shekel as well as a drop in output at the Intel plant in Kiryat Gat as it upgraded to the next generation of semiconductors. As a result, Israeli economic growth this year was powered by consumer spending rather than its traditional engine of exports. But economists and the government are expecting their roles to be reversed this year. The Bank of Israel forecast consumer spending growth to slow to 4% this year from 5.9% in 2016, while exports of goods and services show a 2.9% rise, accelerating to 4.3% in 2018.

The explosions were heard in the capital, and residents in the southwest suburbs saw a large plume of smoke rising from the area, while video footage downloaded on social media showed flames leaping from parts of Mezzah military airport's compound, Reuters reports. Syrian state television quoted the army as saying several rockets were fired from an area near Lake Tiberias in northern Israel just after midnight which landed in the compound of the airbase, used by President Bashar al-Assad's elite Republican Guards. "Syrian army command and armed forces warn Israel of the repercussions of the flagrant attack and stresses its continued fight against (this) terrorism and amputate the arms of the perpetrators," the army command said in a statement. The statement did not disclose if there were any casualties, but said the rockets caused a fire. Earlier, state television said several major explosions hit Mezzah military airport's compound and ambulances were rushed to the area. Government forces had in the past used the base to fire rockets at former rebel-held areas in the capital's suburbs. The airport, located just a few kilometers from Assad's presidential palace, had been a base used to fire rockets at former rebel-held areas in the suburbs of Damascus. Israel in the past has targeted positions of Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah group inside Syria where the Iranian-backed group is heavily involved in fighting alongside the Syrian army. Only last November, the Syrian army said Israeli jets fired two missiles on an area west of the capital, close to the Damascus Beirut-highway, in an attack mounted from Lebanese air space. Diplomatic sources say Israel has in the past few years targeted advanced weapons systems, including Russian made anti-aircraft and Iranian made missiles and bombed the elite Fourth Armored Division base on Qasioun mountain in the capital. An air strike in Syria in December 2015 killed a prominent Hezbollah leader, Samir Qantar. Israel welcomed Qantar's death, saying he was preparing attacks from Syrian soil, but stopped short of confirming responsibility for eliminating him. Earlier that year, an Israeli air strike in Syria killed six members of Hezbollah, including a commander and the son of the its late military chief Imad Moughniyah near the Golan Heights.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on January 13 2017 01:45 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email The future of the MacBook Air has been looking quite bleak for the past couple of months now. Firstly, its little brother, the 11-inch MacBook Air was unofficially discontinued last September. Secondly, the 13-inch MacBook Air could be facing the same fate with the release of the MacBook Pro 2016. Finally, a report on IT Home suggests that Apple is indeed considering the discontinuation of the laptop some time this year. All in all, it is not looking at all good for the MacBook Air. That being said, the MacBook Air still remains one of the best selling laptops from Apple. That is why when news of its supposed demised got out, many fans felt a bit disappointed with Apple. Then again, it may still not be that late to save the laptop from meeting its end. Perhaps there are ways to salvage the MacBook Air, give it the much needed upgrade. Added Security Nowadays, online security is of utmost importance. Although the macOS Sierra is still one of the most secure operating system around, additional security measure will definitely not go amiss. Apple has currently added another layer of security to the MacBook Pro 2016 with the TouchID. Implementing the same on the MacBook Air will be a welcomed addition to the already safe laptop. On the other hand, retina and facial recognition may also be considered on the MacBook Air. In fact, the laptop is already equipped with an iSight camera. By adding an extra infrared camera for iris scanning will put another layer of security to the laptop. MacBook Air (via apple.com) Touch-enabled Display For many years now, Mac fans have been pestering Apple to include touch-enabled displays on its Mac products. Finally, the company relented – somewhat halfheartedly – with the inclusion of the Touch Bar. Unfortunately, the feature still lacks the complexity of a full-fledged touch display. By offering a touch-enabled display to the MacBook Air, the laptop will again look and feel relevant in today’s trend. Keep the MagSafe The MagSafe is perhaps one of the best feature of the MacBook Air and of older MacBook Pros. The charging port assures safe usage by easily detaching from the laptop in the event of accidental cable trip up. Unfortunately, Apple has decided that the connector is now outdated and replaced it with a USB Type-C port. From Apple’s point of view, this is what moving forward looks like. However, for many consumers who actually use the laptop, having the MagSafe around lets them breathe easier. Better Processor and Longer Battery Life Releasing a new product without updating the performance is a big no in today’s tech world. Unfortunately, Apple can only do so much as it has to rely on suppliers like Intel to provide the best possible hardware. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that the MacBook Air needs a beefier chip for it to thrive. However, this improvement should not harm the expected usage time of the laptop. The current MacBook Air lasts for an average of 12 hours on a single charge. Employing a more efficient processor can possibly extend its life for a few more hours. Which is always a good thing for people who are always on the move. The MacBook Air showcased what Apple can do as a product designer and manufacturer. It has proven that with the right mindset, Apple can provide the best product for consumers. That being said, as much as it pains many about the MacBook Air’s demise, Apple needs to move on. And, so do the millions of its adoring fans. For more updates on the MacBoor Air, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health The How-To Guide For Corporate Venturing By IESE Insight January 13, 2017 At BMW’s Startup Garage, the century-old, illustrious company has become a client of entrepreneurs who bring products, services and/or technologies not yet ready for the road. Essentially, the Startup Garage is a venturing program for those hoping to ultimately become BMW suppliers. Here startups offer BMW cutting-edge technical innovations in exchange for the chance to validate their offerings and land a large, renowned client. This global giant’s means to become a venture client is one example of how businesses are breaking out of the old too-big-to-fail mindset to face disruptive technologies head on. Disruption’s survivors are learning how to benefit from new modes of engagement with potential competitors and tomorrow’s startups. Call it corporate venturing, as explained in a January 2017 whitepaper by Julia Prats and Pau Amigó of IESE, together with Xavier Ametller and Adrià Batlle of mVenturesBcn — a program of Mobile World Capital Barcelona. In this paper, the co-authors outline a menu of options for established businesses looking to embrace startups in their drive to achieve profitable growth. From Disruption to Opportunity Not long ago, established companies and startups would have seemed strange bedfellows. While legacy companies lumbered along, taking only calculated risks, the newcomers were seen to be agile and ready to take a gamble. According to Prats et al., corporate venturing “has turned these big differences into the biggest reasons to build bridges between them.” As BMW’s example demonstrates, collaborations with startups can offer corporations a chance to source the latest technologies and novel business models. At the same time, early-stage businesses can benefit from established sales and supply-chain opportunities. But the advantages are not limited to firms. “As it turns out, collaboration is a driver of growth for local economies, for the economy in general and for the standard of living of customers,” the authors state. A How-to Guide The Celsa Group, one of Europe’s top four steelmakers, is striving to lead industry transformation via innovation in energy storage, traceability in the supply chain, 3-D printing, “smart steel” and recycling byproducts. To that end, they created Ingenium, an accelerator program embedded in its open innovation strategy. Selected high-potential startups attend a two-day “Demo Day” to familiarize themselves with the company’s facilities and the main challenges Celsa faces. Participants then develop a pilot of their product or service for professionals at Celsa, available for a limited duration. To arrive at a corporate venturing solution such as this, companies must follow three clear steps: 1) Set-up objectives; 2) Build a venturing strategy; 3) Define the organizational strategy and resources. In addition, they need to think about the tools and other resources at their disposal. The Venturing Toolkit At the 2015 Mobile World Congress, Intel, Cisco and Deutsche Telekom announced their “ChallengeUP!” program. This international hybrid incubator and accelerator program aims to facilitate participants’ market readiness and commercial success. Meanwhile, Telefónica keeps adding to its own multilayered approach to corporate venturing, with international acceleration programs, venture capital funds and more. Telefónica’s Open Future program was in 17 countries as of December 2016. Exactly how to choose an incubator versus an excubator, hackathon or accelerator is, for many, the hard part. “We know the question is not whether to capture innovation,” they write, “but how.” The menu of venturing tools spans from traditional to novel approaches, offering companies many ways to achieve their aims. And there’s no need for corporations to limit themselves to a single tool, explain Prats et al. Like ChallengeUP!, sometimes a combination is best suited to corporate goals. The main options include: Sharing resources: A means to grant startups access to resources while the established corporations get closer to the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Challenge prize: An open competition that focuses on a specific issue, offering an incentive to field innovators to develop the best solution. Hackathon: A focused workshop where software developers come together to collaboratively find technological solutions to a corporate innovation challenge. Scouting mission: The established company appoints an individual within a given industry to scope out innovation opportunities in alignment with the corporate strategy. Strategic partnership: Alliances between established corporations and startups can take many forms — including the co-development of products and services and the venture client. Excubator: A combination of an incubator and accelerator, it functions as an external venture builder for an established corporation. Corporate incubator: This includes mentoring and value-added services to support entrepreneurs building viable, market-ready ideas. Corporate accelerator: Short or medium-term support offered to cohorts of startups via mentoring, education, work space and more. Corporate venture capital: Corporations use direct equity investments to target startups of strategic interest. Acquisition program: Established firms purchase startups in order to access their products. Building Bridges Corporate venturing is building bridges between two realms that only a decade ago seemed to be completely at odds. The results are often greatly beneficial for both, as eight brief case studies help show in the paper. Among them, BMW, Celsa, Cisco, Deutsche Telekom, Intel and Telefónica all share their stories with positive outcomes. However, the authors warn, corporate venturing also brings many challenges. “These are two deeply different types of organizations with different processes, timing and culture that are as much complementary as they are incompatible and toxic.” As the rules of the game are still evolving, the important thing is for established companies to look beyond the potential mistrust and understand the opportunities. Learning new ways to join the technological disruptions can help legacy firms not only survive, but also achieve ambitious long-term goals while benefitting the business ecosystem. This 40-page report is the first to be published by mVenturesBcn, a program of Mobile World Capital Barcelona, together with IESE, whose participation was led by the Bertrán Foundation Chair holder, Júlia Prats, with research assistant Pau Amigó.

Price $2699 AUD > Pricing info Specs 12.5-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS screen • 910 grams weight • 16GB LPDDR3 2133MHz memory • 512GB SATA 3 or 512GB PCIe Gen 3 SSD • 1 x USB 3.0 Type-C output. Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Thin and light doesn’t go far enough. The Zenbook 3 is the culmination of several years of development of the highly successful Zenbook series, and we have to say that it’s a piece of art. When you pick this Ultrabook up, you’ll be simply amazed at how thin and light Asus has managed to create a laptop – it actually feels lighter than a standard print magazine. It’s a sign that we’ve entered a new era of ultra-portable computing, and we’re enamoured by it in nearly every way. Measuring a mere 11.9mm in depth, Asus apparently had to invent the world’s thinnest screen hinge to make this a reality, at just 3mm deep. Despite its small 12.5-inch 1920 x 1080 screen, Asus has managed to fit a full-sized keyboard into this laptop – if the screen were any smaller it would be simply impossible. And yet it feels absolutely beautiful to use despite the short key-travel, as does the super accurate touchpad. We can’t understate how wonderful the touchpad is – it’s totally spot on with accuracy, and the invisible buttons are just in the right place.  Asus even managed to fit four speakers into such a tiny unit, thanks to help from Harmon Kardon, yet to be honest they’re still not a huge increase in quality from the usual average sound from a laptop. The entire unit is housed in an all-metal unibody-design, which means Asus has carved the entire top and bottom halves of the chassis from a single piece of metal, which also happens to be made from aerospace grade alloy, making it 50% stronger than the usual metal used in most other Ultrabooks. Golden edge highlights complement the beautifully smooth metallic exterior, with a golden Asus logo dead centre of the exterior of the top screen. Matching this is the golden backlight on the keyboard, with Asus sticking with a single colour rather than the rave-like lighting found elsewhere, reinforcing that this Ultrabook is all class.  Weighing a mere 910 grams, Asus has used Corning Gorilla 4, which is just 0.4mm. It’s an IPS display with a huge 178 degree viewing angle, we were also impressed by just how rich the colours and contrast are of this screen. Asus claims a 1000:1 contrast ration, and we believe them. The screen is surrounded by a tiny 7.6mm bezel, which helps make the display look bigger without making the entire unit look too large.  Sadly the small size means battery life suffers, measuring just 168 minutes in our PCMark 8 battery test. We think this thing will probably struggle to live up to its all-day claims.  The key to this machines ultra-tiny size is Intel’s new range of processors. Available with either an i7 7500U (twin cores, Hyper-Threaded, 2.7GHz base speed, 3.5GHz Turbo speed, 25W TDP) or the i5 7200U Processor (twin-core, HyperThreaded, 2.5GHz base speed, 3.1GHz Turbo Speed, 15W TDP), the low power usage on these chips means Asus didn’t need to worry about exorbitant cooling solutions. Our review sample came packing the higher end chip, hence the higher price. Obviously there’s no discrete GPU at this weight class, but 8GB of LPDDR3 2133MHz (upgradeable to 16GB) memory helps keep the pace up. There are also two options for the drive -  a 512GB SATA 3 drive, or a 512GB M.2 PCIe Gen 3 SSD (our sample had the M.2 drive); while the latter offers superior speed, both offer a decent amount of space for such a small Ultrabook.  This hardware combination powered the Zenbook 3 UX390 to a PCMark 8 Score of 3809 – nothing mind-blowing, but enough to run several applications without noticing severe slow down. If there is one annoyance, it’s something Mac owners will be used to – in terms of connectivity there aren’t a lot of options. In fact, just a single USB 3.1 Type-C port is included, which doubles as the power port. There’s also a 3.5mm stereo minijack for audio but that’s it. Asus is gracious enough to include a Type-C dongle that adds HDMI, USB 3.0 Type-A and another Type-C connection. There’s even a carry pouch to keep it scratch free. This Ultrabook might not be cheap, but it is arguably the sexiest on the market. The unbelievably low weight and ultra slick design helps it stand out from the pack, and is the best Zenbook Asus has ever made, which is saying something. Just be prepared to add the cost of a USB 3.0 Type-C into the buying equation.  Related Reviews Review: Asus ZenBook Flip UX360UA convertible laptop Review: the HP Spectre couldn't be any more lux if it tried Review: Asus PCE-AC88 AC3100 Asus ROG Rampage V Edition 10 Review: Asus ROG Strix GL502 Gaming Laptop Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 American jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the US. Trump’s policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they be corrupted and engage in favouritism. This is a prized principle in the US—but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sector, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the government provides the investment, infrastructure, finance and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programmes, such as loan assistance or government purchases, as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. The electric car maker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee programme as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. But the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state”—a reality that they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have of course been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse—and the attendant success of its export-oriented model—without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, of course, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about the technological and market realities on the ground. But they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pockets, or, at the other extreme, simply order them around. And that is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On the one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he doesn’t have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means that we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some; but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. ©2017/PROJECT SYNDICATE Dani Rodrik professor of international political economy at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 12, 2017 at 7:16PM Market research company IDC announced on Jan. 11 that the category of products that it refers to as "traditional [personal computers]" dropped 1.5% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 5.7% over the course of the entirety of 2016. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers could help the company regain lost share in 2017. Image source: Apple.  IDC said that the first quarter of 2016 was "still constrained by high inventory, free Windows 10 upgrades, and difficult comparisons to commercial replacements in 2014 that were fueled by the end of support for Windows XP." That said, IDC says that beginning in mid-2016, the personal computer market had "moved beyond these inhibitors and seen stabilizing commercial demand." IDC also said that the "contraction of the consumer [personal computer] market has also slowed as growth and competition from tablets and phones has eased up." Analyst Neha Mahajan with IDC did say that the fourth-quarter numbers "might signal regained consumer confidence in the [personal computer] market, with most of the sales being driven by aggressive holiday promotions," cautioning that "it needs to be seen how much of the real demand is carried forward in the coming quarters." This report certainly doesn't spell bad news for the personal computer market -- a contracting rate of decline is certainly preferable to a stable or accelerating rate of decline -- but it does seem to reinforce the commonly held notion that the market isn't likely to be a growth one going forward. Vendor share shifts Although the personal computer market is down overall, there were some winners and losers among the major personal computer vendors. IDC's press release included significant details of the performances of the top five personal computer vendors by units -- Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, ASUS, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The report shows that Lenovo, the top vendor by units, saw shipments drop 3%, outpacing the overall market, and growing its market share to 21.3%, up from 20.8% in the prior year. HP Inc, which has talked at length about its efforts to gain share in the personal computer market (particularly in more lucrative sub-segments like premium thin-and-light PCs, gaming, and so on) managed to grow shipments by 1.3%, taking its share up to 20.9% from 19.4%. Privately held Dell enjoyed 4.3% growth, the fastest growing of the bunch. Its market share moved up from 14.2% to 15.7%. ASUS saw a modest 0.8% drop in unit shipments, which -- considering that the overall market dropped by 5.7% -- led to share growth from 7% to 7.4%. Apple -- which specializes in premium personal computers running its macOS operating system -- suffered a 9.8%-unit decline, taking its share down from 7.4% to just 7.1%. And, finally, the rest of the market combined -- which added up to about 72 million units -- suffered a drop in collective market share from 31.2% to 27.7%. In other words, the strong got stronger (save for Apple), and the weak got weaker. What this "consolidation" means for market players  IDC noted that there was "accelerated market consolidation" going on "as the largest players moved to lock up supply." This consolidation might have some interesting long-term consequences on the industry at large. Consolidation of power among system vendors should give them additional leverage/buying power with the major component vendors like microprocessor specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which supplies most of the central processing units (CPUs) that go into personal computers today. Intel's new seventh-generation Core processors were recently launched to allow computer vendors to refresh their systems. Image source: Intel.  The bigger the volumes any personal computer vendor commands, the steeper the volume discounts those vendors can demand from their suppliers. Such a dynamic may lead to decreased margins for the suppliers and increased margins for the system vendors (due to lower component costs). Consolidation may also mean that the winners should enjoy improved profitability as competitive pressures ease (potentially driving gross profit margins up) and the revenue shares of said winners improve (perhaps driving operating leverage).

Aside from the upcoming octacore, AMD will also be bringing out a quad-core Ryzen processor, which the company has reportedly begun sampling this week. The quad-core Ryzen CPU is expected to take on the Core i5 and Core i3 with four cores and four threads. This processor will be the entry-level for Ryzen, falling under the SR3 brand, as a result, it apparently won’t use some of AMD’s new tech, such as Simultaneous Multi-Threading, which is similar to Intel’s Hyper-Threading. We don’t know exactly when quad-core Ryzen CPUs will be available to buy but given that most of Intel’s Kaby Lake lineup now feature Hyper Threading all the way down to the Pentium series, AMD may need to make sure these SKUs are cheap enough to tempt people away. That said, these quad-core chips should still have an unlocked multiplier, so overclocking will be possible. KitGuru Says: While Ryzen will officially launch quite soon, AMD will be rolling out different SKUs over the course of 2017, with quad-core and potentially even six-core processors. It will certainly be interesting to see how things play out between Intel and AMD throughout the year. How many of you guys are planning on picking up a Ryzen CPU this year?  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: AMDnewsRyzen Categorized Under: CPU Chris Bennett If history has proven has anything to do with this, multi-threading might be locked but the right motherboard will be able to lock most. These are QA 8 core failures. Chances are that these also have 8 cores that could also be unlocked. Don’t doubt this if you are an Intel fanatic. I have been following every move both these chip makers have been doing since 2000. I also made around $270.000 grand in 9 months on AMD stock in the last 10 months. It pays to know.

Try enabling something thats not even connected to the rest of the chip.

And will be difficult for them to fill market demand from just failed 8cores. Smart move would be to make a smaller die for just this to maximize profit in this market segment. Besides, they will make sure this time to prevent any core unlocking. As that really hurt them last time this was possible.

According to Ian Fogg, director at market research firm IHS, Apple creates so good products that it always competes with its previously launched products. “They set their own stands. But, there has been no Apple product with greater impact than the iPhone, for Apple, for the mobile industry, and because of the spread of mobile technology, for the whole technology industry,” Fogg said. The original iPhone included multiple innovations including a direct manipulation multi-touch interface and desktop PC class web browser and other built in apps such as Google Maps, Apple Mail, and calendar and contacts. This caused every other mobile handset maker to alter their products. Apple also innovated quickly, using an annual update cycle to the iPhone hardware and software to outpace many rivals, Fogg said. In the ten years since the iPhone’s announcement there are numerous changes directly or indirectly caused by the iPhone, Fogg claims and here are just a few of the important one: 1)The leading handset makers of 2007 – number one Nokia among them – have been replaced by Apple, Samsung and Huawei. 2) The leading smartphone operating systems of 2007 are no longer with us, including Symbian, BlackBerry, Palm, and Windows CE. Read: Apple might launch three new iPads in March this year 3)The smartphone has moved from a product with niche adoption to one which everyone owns. 4) Multi-touch interfaces have become mainstream, not only on smartphones, but on PCs and tablets as well. 5) Apps have become mainstream, replacing websites for many uses, because of Apple’s success of creating an easy profitable way to distribute apps; and, other companies have used the same model, including the Google Play store and Microsoft’s Windows PC app store. Read: As Apple’s iPhone turns 10 today, Cook says just getting started 6) The smartphone has become the hub for consumers’ digital lives, replacing the PC. In 2007, every hardware product connected to the PC, now everything connects to smartphones. 7) Technologies pioneered in smartphones have enabled the creation of new products, from tablets, to smartwatches, fitness trackers and TV streaming boxes such as Apple TV. Companies making mobile hardware and software such as ARM, Facebook and Google, have prospered, at the expense of competitors who have failed to succeed in mobile such as Intel and Microsoft. 9) The aspirational business model for technology companies has changed from licensing an operating system and allowing others to build hardware – like the classic PC business model – has been replaced with efforts to replicate Apple’s tight integration of hardware and software.

During CES, I had some one-on-one time with various RTG members, and began thinking of the future of Radeon.     I plan a series of articles on Vega, but we need to split them into a few different parts - where I want to talk more about High Bandwidth Cache, and what it could mean not just for Vega, but for the future of gaming.     More Isn't Necessarily Better   We have been stuck in this world of 'more is better' and that the larger the amount of VRAM on a graphics card, the better it is. I know that's not how it works, but after 10 years in retail IT sales selling graphics cards, custom gaming PCs and everything in between - most consumers think 'higher numbers = better/faster'.   It has been ingrained into us from a very young age, the moreMHz a CPU had, the faster it was. The more GPU cores a graphics card has, the faster it is. The more VRAM a graphics card is, the more it can handle - but VRAM is a tricky thing.   More doesn't mean better, because the framebuffer is filled differently depending on the game. Some games will allocate much more VRAM than the actual game is using to render the graphics on screen, and this has been OK... until now. We can't keep pushing into a world where 8GB or 12GB or 16GB of VRAM is normal - especially when so many gamers are stuck at 1080p - where, you simply do not need more than 4-8GB of VRAM (depending on the game, graphics settings, anti-aliasing applied, and so on).     High Bandwidth Cache, Alongside HBM2, Could Change Everything     AMD is changing that game with Vega and its beyond exciting High Bandwidth Cache, or HBC. HBC is something I covered in my initial Vega GPU architectural preview article last week, but I've spent 60 hours travelling on 6 planes, attended CES with a bunch of meetings - and personally, an anxiety attack in between (we're human, I'm human, and I like to make my articles personal - I'm not a robot).     After all of this, I've been able to get a cleaner feel for what HBC and HBM2 means for the future of AMD. AMD doesn't have the money that NVIDIA does, and while some people are aware of this, some aren't. Some look at AMD and think because they're a publicly traded company that has been around for decades and made some of the most technologically impressive consumer products ever, that they're flush with cash.   Well, they're not... and you know what? That gives them a strength that you can only have when you're in that position. When you're in a position of Intel or NVIDIA, you begin to feel more comfortable - you begin to sit inside of that 'tick, tock' pattern - or the slight iteration changes between Maxwell and Pascal.   AMD has to think outside of the box, and into the stars - beyond the stars and into a new horizon. Once they're outside of the realms of possibilities, they can swim in a pool of pure technological fantasy. This is a pool I'd love to some day swim in, and Vega is the first product of that new direction. Recommended for You AMD to launch monster Navi 10 in 2019 with next-gen...

The ceremony marked the official launch of construction on the Inaugural platform where the next President of the United States will take the oath of office on Friday, January 20, 2017. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)    5421832 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for an FBI investigation into allegations President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign had links with the Kremlin following a closed-door briefing at the Capitol Friday. “The FBI should be investigating this charge, because what is it that the Russians know or have about that communication during the campaign that increases their leverage over this new administration?” she told reporters at her weekly press conference. Pelosi was unable to provide details from the classified meeting, adding she could not confirm whether the investigation will take place. “I can just say publicly that I think the American people are owed the truth, and there’s a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people – the strength, the integrity of our own democracy,” she said. “And for that reason the FBI should let us know whether they’re doing that.” She went on to slam Republican senators for opting against an investigation into the matter. “Leader [Mitch] McConnell is saying the [Senate] Intelligence Committee can do that,” she said. “Meanwhile, the GOP chair of the Senate Intel Committee, Sen. Burr, announced he will not investigate Russia and the campaign in the U.S.,” she said. “That makes Republicans accomplices in my view of President-elect Trump’s praise of Putin.” Follow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Billy Steele, @wmsteele 01.13.17 in Wearables Comments 924 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If you're still on the fence about just how useful a smartwatch can be, a group of researchers at Stanford University have some news for you. The scientists discovered that using algorithms to monitor a combination of vital signs gathered by the Basis B1 and Basis Peak can determine if you're about to catch a cold, days before you actually get sick. Using stats like heart rate and skin temperature, researchers say the smartwatches can indicate the first signs of an impending illness. During the course of their research, the team at Stanford gathered details from 40 volunteers who wore the devices for two years. The information gathered shows that people exhibited an unusually elevated pulse and warmer than average skin temperatures (at times) before any physical signs of a cold or infection. The tech could tell up to three days in advance of symptoms starting to present themselves. In addition to the two Basis devices, the group used the Moves app, Scanadu health tracker and Masimo iSpO2 to double check pulse and skin temperature readings as well monitor as blood oxygen levels. The readings were compared to those gathered with a WA 6000 series vital signs monitor in the Stanford lab. In their findings that were published this week, researchers say that if your heart rate and skin temperature are elevated for two hours, there's a good chance you're getting sick. The Stanford researchers are hoping to develop algorithms that will allow your smartwatch to send you a notification when you might be coming down with something. They warn that just because you know in advance that you're getting sick doesn't necessarily mean you can avoid it entirely. When it comes to wearable tech, there's also the issue of accuracy. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to use the Basis Peak to test these findings. Intel discontinued and recalled the device following overheating issues back in August. It also shut down the accompanying services. Now that we know the wearable could have been used to alert users to potential illness, it's a shame Intel decided to kill it off like so other many malfunctioning devices.

Bridges Market (2016-2022)" report to their offering. Worldwide Smart Roads and Bridges Market is expected to reach 2,660.0 million by 2022, growing at a CAGR of around 24.1% during the forecast period 2016-2022. Increasing vehicle ownership, growing traffic congestion, unpredictable hazards due to natural calamities are forcing the governments to focus on the development of digital infrastructure. The worldwide increase in the road accidents is one of the major drivers for adopting smart technology in roads and bridges. There is an increased interest among the organizations and major companies are going after the potential in the smart roads and bridges market. Sensors are the major end-products playing a primitive role in building smart roads and bridges. The sensors market will be further segmented into accelerometers, anemometers, temperature sensors, and others. Temperature sensors are having the majority of the market share and are expected to reach $751.2 million by 2022. A number of start-ups are entering the sensors market. Innovations in IoT and increasing R&D investments from big organizations for the enhancements in sensors are also contributing to the growth. The introduction of automated vehicles has increased the risk of unpredictability in the smarter world - smart roads and bridges are the addressed solutions for these uncertainties. Smart roads are considered the future roads that assist drivers in understanding the incidents happening on the roads such as traffic congestion, breakdowns, and repair situations in advance. In the same way, smart bridges are those which are technologically advanced and alert the respectable maintenance department for any uncertainties prior to their occurrence. The smart roads and bridges market is expected to become one of the emerging markets in the next 5 years. The sensors and GPS trackers are the major end-products being adopted during the construction of smart roads and bridges. This opportunity has resulted in the increase of sensor companies to hugely invest in the technological innovations in the sensor industry. As for now, there is an increased interest by governments for adopting smart technologies in building roads and bridges, offering companies to come up with new innovative ideas to grab the market share and stand out from the competitive industry.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 01.13.17. 01.13.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Tesla Is Snatching Apple’s Stars to Make Itself the New Apple Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg/Getty Images If you don’t follow the ins and outs of Silicon Valley personnel moves, you might have missed the news. Even if you saw it, it may not have made much sense. Chris Lattner is leaving Apple for Tesla? Chris who? Lattner doesn’t enjoy the name recognition of a Tim Cook or a Jony Ive. But he’s a rock star among software engineers. As the guy who built Swift, Apple’s iPhone-centric programming language, he’s one of those coders that other coders put on a pedestal. He personifies Silicon Valley’s relentless push toward technology capable of changing the world. Tesla is not just building a car. It’s building an entirely new kind of computer. Now, he’s moving on, becoming the head of software engineering for Autopilot, the technology that’s transforming Tesla’s electric vehicles into autonomous vehicles. Apple’s innovation machine is losing another key cog to a company that has lured so many others away from the House That Jobs Built. And that provides an obvious storyline for the tech press and so many other Silicon Valley watchers: Tesla is the new Apple. In many ways, the story is true. Apple vice president of Mac engineering Doug Field, director of alloy engineering Rich Heley, and MacBook Air engineer Matt Casebolt are among those who’ve left Cupertino for Tesla. But the truth goes deeper than that. Sure, Tesla is snagging some of Apple’s mojo, becoming a defining symbol of Silicon Valley innovation. “Apple is stuck in the world of phones and watches,” the argument goes, “while Tesla is well down the path to self-driving cars, for Jobs’ sake!” Look beyond the A-list talent and sexy public image, though, and you’ll see that Tesla is mimicking Apple (and Google and Amazon and Facebook) in a more meaningful way. Lattner’s arrival is just the latest evidence of this. Like those other tech giants, Tesla is not just building new products. It’s building them from entirely new parts, remaking them from top to bottom. Apple did this with phones. Now, Tesla is doing it with cars—and with computers, too. Extreme Engineering Google didn’t just build a new search engine. It built a new kind of global computer capable of running that search engine at unprecedented scale, fashioning everything from the software to the servers to the network switches to the data centers. That’s what made Google so successful: It could serve far more people, far more quickly than anyone else. Facebook and Amazon soon followed suit. In similar fashion, Apple didn’t just build the iPhone. It built so many of the individual parts inside the iPhone, including the microprocessor at the heart of this iconic device. That allowed the company to not only build a phone no one else could, but do it with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Tesla knows that autonomous vehicles require the same kind of extreme engineering. Tesla is not just building a car, it’s building an entirely new kind of computer. Today, computers are designed to send data into the world. Autonomous vehicles require computers that can draw data from the world and use it to understand what’s happening around it. That is a very different kind of computer, and it hasn’t yet been built—not to the degree that anyone can be sure it will work with unerring accuracy and safety. Chris Lattner DANILO AGUTOLI Fundamentals Tesla hired Lattner because he has a history of building enormously complex, enormously successful software projects. As his PhD advisor, Vikram Adve, points out, Swift is just one example of this. Before that, Lattner built two other software projects on a similar scale: LLVM and Clang. Never heard of those? Then you’re not a software engineer. These are foundational tools at both Apple and Google, underpinning everything that happens on the iPhone and on every Google online service. “Chris is really good at managing and running a large software project, with very high quality, attracting really good programmers, and getting results,” says Adve, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Lattner did not respond to my request for an interview. But his previous work is telling not just because it was so successful, but because it was foundational. LLVM and Clang are software tools that engineers use to build other software—and build it at the most fundamental level, the level where it talks to the hardware. Tesla needs people like Lattner in part because it has split with Mobileye, the Israeli company that makes the image recognition system currently underpinning Autopilot. It must build a whole new system, apparently around GPU chips from nVidia, the graphics processing chips that now do double-duty at the heart of many artificially intelligent systems, And Lattner is the kind of engineer who can lead the development of this system. Not to mention: the foundational software that drives nVidia GPUs is based on LLVM.

While Lattner will run the software side, the head of hardware engineering for Autopilot is Jim Keller, the former Apple chip designer who helped build many of the microprocessors that went into the world’s iPhones. (Several of Keller’s old colleagues are now also working for Tesla.) Tesla has the key talent needed to build its own AI technology from top to bottom. And it may have to. Mobileye is off the table, and it’s still unclear whether GPUs are the future of autonomous vehicles. Mobileye apparently dumped Tesla for moving too fast down the road to self-driving cars, but Tesla has no intention of slowing down. No one outside of Tesla knows whether Tesla is building an AI chip. But hiring Keller suggests that it will. And if it does, it will need people like Lattner to build the low-level software that can drive those chips. Fundamentally, LLVM is a tool for building software that could run on any piece of hardware. It lets you readily target the chips you want to target, says Todd Mostak, the CEO of MapD, a company that uses LLVM to build database software for multiple processors.

Now It’s Slowing Apple Down The world is already headed toward a new kind of AI chip. Last year, Google revealed that it built one called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU, and commercial chip makers like nVidia and Intel are building dedicate AI chips as well. Such chips are needed to serve the demands of the neural networks and other techniques behind so many of the AI-driven services moving into the market, from image and speech recognition to the nerve centers that drive autonomous cars. Tesla could get this technology elsewhere, but its ambition is often far more extreme. After all, it’s already building its own batteries in its own factory. Building your own stuff lets you do things no one else can do, at a scale and cost no one else can achieve. That’s where the real advantage comes. So, yes, Tesla hired Chris Lattner because it wants to be more like Apple. But it also hired him because it wants to be something very different. Go Back to Top.

Today’s cutting-edge HDTVs and high definition sources demand dramatically higher data rate transfers than previous generations of Audio / Video components. They place incredible bandwidth/performance demands on HDMI cables. In fact, today’s most advanced components operate very close to the limits of current HDMI technology. Online forums have been inundated with questions about HDMI cables. As an industry insider I have been answering a number of these questions. Here are five of the most often asked. 1. Is there really a difference between expensive HDMI cable and inexpensive cable? There is a difference between expensive and budget HDMI cables. It revolves around the quality of the cable build and the materials used. The question is whether this will affect my set up. First you should determine the length between your source and your display. If this is less than 15 feet a “standard” cable will be ok. If it is more than 15 feet you are best to consider a “high speed” cable. Make sure that you buy from a reputable source and that the cable is marked with the HDMI logo and says that it is a version 1.3 (don’t worry about a, b or c as these are only testing protocols) If you live in a coastal or high humidity area it is worth considering getting a cable with gold connectors. While this will not improve your signal it will stop corrosion degrading the signal over time. Some people assume that as the signals are digital either the cable works or not. Sometimes however the 1s and 0s aren’t all there because of signal degradation due to inferior cable construction. That can be especially true with audio and video sources such as CDs and DVDs. The signal will degrade gracefully, to a point and then it will break up. Music and video is not like data. Digital signal processors can work with a degraded signal and deliver less than perfect sound and pictures. You can never improve a digital signal by using an expensive cable but you can certainly degrade a signal using an inferior cable. 2. Is it OK to bend HDMI cables? It is best to avoid bending an HDMI cable, certainly do not kink it. What this does is changes the distance between wires, shielding and insulation internally within the cable. The process of cable manufacture can have a dramatic effect on how the transmitted information looks from one side of the cable to the other. This means that a cable with better shielding and a more precise distance between the “intelligence” and “ground” wires, will yield a better connection with less interference. Many things can affect your signal. The electrons will create a standing wave in the cable; this will create a small magnetic field around the cable. Any imperfection or splice in the cable will disrupt these waves and will reflect/refract the waves. Magnetic information can also leak from one cable to another. 3. Should I buy 1.3a HDMI Cables or 1.3b HDMI Cables or what? There is a bit of confusion in the market about all of the versions. What you are referring to here is the specification version, not to be confused with the connector type. As long as you choose version 1.3 you will be ok. The suffixes of a, b or c merely refer to the testing protocols and really have no consumer impact, although makers are using them to market. (bigger numbers/letters are better…) 4. Will I be able to get the same quality video/audio with a HDMI to DVI-D cable? “DVI-I” stands for “DVI-Integrated” and supports both digital and analog transfers, so it works with both digital and analog Visual Display Units. “DVI-D” stands for “DVI-Digital” and supports digital transfers only. DVI also includes provision for a second data link for high resolution displays, though many devices do not implement this. In those that do, the connector is sometimes referred to as DVI-DL (dual link). When you convert HDMI to DVI you drop the audio as DVI does not support any audio signals. You will need to take a separate cable link between your source and the sound system for this to work. You will need also to review the software settings in your source so that they know that you are not outputting audio from the HDMI but a separate outlet. Some new DVD players, TV sets (including HDTV sets) and video projectors have DVI/HDCP connectors; these are physically the same as DVI connectors but transmit an encrypted signal using the HDCP protocol for copy protection. Computers with DVI video connectors can use many DVI-equipped HDTV sets as a display; however, due to Digital Rights Management, it is not clear whether such systems will eventually be able to play protected content, as the link is not encrypted. 5. When I connect my laptop Blu-ray to my HDTV I get an error about violating copy rights. What can I do? You are facing an HDCP (High def copy protection) issue here. HDCP is a form of digital copy protection developed by Intel Corporation to prevent copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across various cables and connections, even if such copying would be permitted by fair use laws. Each device handshakes with the other and then passes an encryption key to say that it is OK to display or play the signal. It does this for every frame, typically 30 times per second. If you are having problems with blank audio or video it is more than likely that one of your devices does not support HDCP. Typically if you are connecting with HDMI all the way through the connection chain you should not have this problem. Source by Sam Blacket This entry was posted in Uncategorized by admin.
