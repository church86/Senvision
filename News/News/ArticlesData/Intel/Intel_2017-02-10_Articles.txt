By Leslie P. Norton Biography August 6, 2011 Murray Stahl, the chief investment officer of New York-based Horizon Kinetics, began his career as a utility analyst. In the early 1980s, Stahl, a value investor, recommended buying shares of out-of-favor General Public Utilities, then the owner of Three Mile Island, which in 1979 had been the site of the U.S.'s worst nuclear power accident. Investors who heeded his advice made big money. Thus began a career of independent thinking about the market and a wide-ranging interest in what makes successful people tick. He shares these views with his investors, and also with subscribers to Horizon publications such as The Spin-off Report and ETF Compendium. (For a taste, check the "Research Library" tab at www.horizonkinetics.com). Last week, Stahl talked with Barron's about exchange-traded funds, the importance of qualitative insights -- and of course, about stocks. Barron's: Why are exchange-traded funds so important to a stockpicker? Stahl: ETFs are affecting the market in bizarre ways. In order to talk about that, I have to first define a term: owner-operator. Owner-operators are equities where the management happens to be the largest shareholders. That is how they become the management. The wealth of the proprietors is tied into the company. If the shareholder isn't successful, the proprietor can't be financially successful. That is what an owner-operator is. Enlarge Image Close "If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned" with those of other shareholders. —Murray Stahl Matthew Furhman for Barron's Jeremy Siegel in The Future for Investors studies the IPO market and rightly concludes that initial public offerings have a predictive tendency to produce unsatisfactory results in comparison to different indices. He gives you a table of IPOs that were very successful. It is a minority. Each and every one is owner-operated. Boards give managers shares. That's the crucial operative term, "give shares." Other shareholders had to buy their shares. If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned. They have a variety of modalities for increasing their wealth, one of which happens to be the shares. I only have one favorable outcome; they have many. ETFs are largely constructed on a market-capitalization-weight, float-adjusted basis. It's never this obvious, but consider a company where management owns a lot of stock and is buying more. At the margin, the stock's weighting in the exchange-traded fund would be reduced. Why? Assuming everything else remains the same, the float is being reduced. Let's take the other extreme case, in which management has sold all their shares. From an ETF perspective, the float increased. Therefore, its weight in the index would more nearly approximate its market capitalization. The exchange-traded fund structure de facto does the opposite of what the insiders do. I find that rather intriguing. What are the ramifications? To begin with, owner-operated companies trade at very low valuations. Eventually, the market corrects that. A more major consequence is that if you examine the S&P 500 since 1957, and the exercise was to find the best stocks, you'd find Wal-Mart WMT -1.5344528083381586% Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Now let's perform the exercise of calculating the S&P as if those companies never existed and were never in it. I promise you that you would never buy the resulting rump S&P, which would probably have returned half of what it was historically. We looked at the 80 owner-operators in Japan and compared them to the three primary indexes: the MSCI Japan, the Topix and the Nikkei. The difference in return was significant per annum. The individual investor should understand that, historically, indexation provided the rates of return it did because of the presence of a given number of owner-operators. Are you saying that individuals shouldn't be in exchange-traded funds? No. Indexation is a very sound idea. I'm really saying that someone should design an ETF that incorporates consciously the owner-operator element. "How They Did It" is a fascinating section in your publications that profiles successful people. Whom did you find most useful? When I went to college, I was interested in economics because as a very naïve person I thought I would learn to make money from the masters. I was absolutely aghast when I learned most of the masters were broke. Karl Marx was destitute most of his life, and if Friedrich Engels hadn't provided financial assistance, who knows what would have happened? There's an apocryphal remark from Marx's wife: "If Karl Marx invested more time into making Das Kapital than writing Das Kapital, his family would have been better off." So I decided to read the lives of people who were financially successful. It is the most interesting part of the whole field of finance. Benjamin Franklin stands head and shoulders above everyone else. For example, during the time of the French and Indian Wars, the Assembly of Philadelphia felt the city might be attacked. But Philadelphia was a Quaker city, and the Quakers were uninterested in violence. Franklin asked if they were opposed to storing grain, because the granaries might be burned in an invasion. They said, "Of course not," and donated money for grain. He went and bought gunpowder on the premise that it's a grainy substance. He wanted to buy artillery from the governor of New York, who wouldn't sell. So Franklin invited him to dinner. He wrote, "After the first bottle of Madeira, I had my first cannon. After the second I had several more. Had I stayed, I could have had them all." Eugene Meyer had very useful insights. He bought 51% of Boston Consolidated, which owned the worst-managed copper mining properties in 1907 or 1908, for one reason: It controlled the upper half of a mountain in Utah and the Guggenheim family controlled the bottom half. They had the technology to extract copper from low-grade ores, which they wouldn't share with Consolidated. But you can't mine the bottom half of a mountain without having the cooperation of the people who own the top half, unless you're not worried about things like avalanches and cave-ins. That's not an asset you find on a balance sheet. Frequently, the qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative. The insights of most of these people are completely qualitative, rarely properly digested by the market. You've written a lot about unsustainable profitability, but the companies in the S&P 500 are continuing to beat estimates. The stock prices clearly reflect unsustainability. Even the worldwide debt crisis plays a role in the unsustainability. Federal spending since 1933 has grown at 9.03% a year. Sooner or later, governments, to alleviate their distress, might raise taxes. That's another way of achieving lower profit margins. How does the market look to you? The stock market will produce very uninspiring results for many years to come. Part of it is the unsustainability of profit margins. Part of it is the debt crisis. In the S&P, a lot of companies already dominate their industries -- food, utilities, drugs. Companies might acquire competitors. But statistically, most acquisitions aren't well-thought-out. They could return cash to shareholders, but if the yield is 2%-3%, you only get that yield and if you buy back a stock at a P/E of, say, 14 to 15 times, invert that and you get a sevenish percent return. Uninspiring. I invite people to undertake this exercise: Take any stock you like, and instead of buying it, make believe you wrote a put option on it, which gives you the right to sell a security at a predefined price. So you sold a put option with a six-month expiration. What happens? You earn a premium. And let's make believe that the stock was completely unchanged for a year. You wrote a put option collecting a premium, the option expired worthless, and you wrote another premium for the remaining six months. Stahl's Picks Recent Company Ticker Price WisdomTree Investments WETF $6.86 CBOE Holdings CBOE 22.45 Beijing Capital Intl Airport 694.HK HK$3.57 ...And a Pan Carmike Cinemas CKED $6.19 Source: Bloomberg Those two premiums in the case of almost every stock is a double-digit number. Of course, it is never a steady-state world. But assuming it were, the premium of virtually any stock is double-digit—that's the return people want to get from the equity, but might not. Now if the stock price is unchanged, that is the rate of return. If the equity goes up in value, you earn that rate of return. If the equity goes down in value, your underlying position is marked down, but you have the cushion of the premium that you collected. If the premiums over the year totaled 12% or 14%, the stock has to decline by 12% or 14% for you to reach breakeven. Our Kinetics Multi-Disciplinary Fund [KMDNX] pursues this strategy. It is similar to equities in terms of its rate of return, but much less volatile. People are looking for that. It works great in an IRA account, in a foundation, anything tax-exempt. Even on a taxable basis, I dare say it will provide an acceptable rate of return. What do you think of emerging markets? They have been a disappointment over the 25 years I've been investing. I don't think they provide the rate of return that justifies the risk. A well-managed emerging- market fund probably returned 12-ish percent over 20 to 25 years. If you're a taxable individual living in the State of New York, if your net after-tax result were in the single digits, would you invest? Most people would decline. The maximum corporate profits are earned when there is little competition. Look at any emerging-market index and see how many companies populate any industry group, with more on the way. I suppose, compared with the uninspiring U.S. equity market, emerging markets look very good. But would I buy an emerging-markets index? No. But there might be splendid emerging-market companies that provide truly unique rates of return. In that case, investment is warranted. Let's talk about stocks. What do you like? I am a big investor in WisdomTree Investments WETF 1.0392609699769053% WisdomTree Investments Inc.

It's better to invest in the ETF company as a business than in exchange-traded funds themselves. WisdomTree is exploring interesting new opportunities, like emerging-currency and debt funds, short-term investments with higher yields and undervalued currencies. WisdomTree's earnings-weighted exchange-traded funds make more sense than the market-capitalization-weighted ETFs. When I bought it, the company traded for roughly 3% of assets under management. It now trades at 7%. I think it will be acquired in a couple of years by a large mutual-fund complex or bank or brokerage that would like to be in exchange-traded funds and wants a revenue stream. Individuals are very unlikely to return to traditional mutual-fund investing where you can exit the investment only after 4 p.m. There are only a handful of large ETF companies. WisdomTree is eighth on the list. The market cap is around $800 million. WisdomTree has minimal earnings. It has invested virtually all of its cash flow into growing the business. The company is now at $13.3 billion of assets, versus less than $4 billion a year ago. If the average fee is 55 basis points [hundredths of a percentage point], that's $70 million of fee income that could become $70 million of operating income on an existing platform. You are paying $800 million for $70 million of income with very high growth rates. An informed buyer might pay $14 or $15 a share.

Why? CBOE just announced July volume up 13%. The operative thing is to look at the volume of the VIX [volatility] contract. The VIX is the company's most valuable asset, only about 2% of volume, but growing 334% a year. In the fullness of time, about three or four years from now, the vehicle of choice for hedging a portfolio will not be the S&P 500 futures contract; it will be the VIX because it's so much more volatile than the S&P. This is a very unique exchange. It has proprietary properties like the VIX and is using that to branch into other volatility trades like the gold VIX, a recent creation that ultimately will probably be successful as well. But that VIX contract is extremely valuable. It has first-mover advantage. I think it is worth in three to four years more than the whole CBOE. The company trades at 15 times earnings; that's not a bargain. The issue is that ultimately it will produce a great deal of earnings. Beijing Capital International Airports [694.Hong Kong] is like CBOE in that both have very little in the way of variable cost. If 10,000 more passengers come into the airport, if someone trades an extra 10,000 VIX contracts, the cost of operating doesn't go up. Prior to 2008, the airport was very profitable. Then it doubled in size and more than doubled operating expenses. Passenger traffic went up, so the airport was more or less breakeven. It has a high growth rate. They're at the stage where increased passenger throughput goes to the bottom line. They preannounced earnings that are vastly higher than forecasts. It trades at 20 times. To judge its future profitability, compare it to Australian-listed MAp Airports, which owns 30%-plus of the Brussels and Copenhagen airports and 74% of Sydney. Its proportion of the traffic is about 40 million passengers a year. Now the Beijing Airport gets more than 70 million passengers a year. MAp's fixed costs are much lower than Beijing's. MAp's airports earn $400 million a year. Beijing Airports earns something like $100 million, but once it achieves the proper economies of scale, it will earn much more than MAp. MAp has a market cap of roughly about $6 billion. And Beijing has a market cap of $2 billion. I think it's worth more than MAp. Anything you dislike? Carmike Cinemas [CKEC]. The average ticket price is increasing at a small rate each year, but attendance is declining 1% to 2% a year, and rents go up every year with a 3% escalator. We're at a point where given competition and other venues of entertainment, it's very hard to raise prices. Margins are razor thin. I think the profitability goes away in 24 months or less.

Peter Bright - Feb 11, 2017 12:00 am UTC A 3D XPoint wafer. Intel reader comments 51 Share this story In 2015, Intel and Micron announced 3D XPoint (pronounced "three dee cross point"), a new form of high-speed, non-volatile, solid-state storage. But we're still waiting for products that actually use the technology. The first 3D XPoint storage should hit the market this year. Branded "Optane," Intel briefly documented (on a PDF that has since been pulled from its website) the first specs of the first of these products: the Intel SSD DC P4800X is a 375GB half-height, half-length PCIe NVMe card aimed at enterprise markets. Optane should also eventually come in 750GB and 1.5TB versions. Taiwanese site PCADV spotted the specs while they were up. When Intel announced 3D XPoint, the company said that it would be 1,000 times faster than NAND flash, 10 times denser than (volatile) DRAM, and with 1,000 times the endurance of NAND, too, which would greatly reduce the susceptibility of 3D XPoint drives to write-induced failures. The specs of this first SSD reflect these ambitions, but perhaps not in quite the way people would have expected. Enlarge / P4800X spec sheet. PCADV The 2,400MB/s read speed is high, but it's not king of the hill. Introduced in 2014, Intel's SSD DC P3700, the company's nearest equivalent product using NAND flash technology, boasts up to 2,800MB/s reads. Samsung's consumer-oriented 960 EVO manages 3,200MB/s read performance. The Optane drive's write performance, however, gives little or nothing up. At 2,000MB/s, it's slightly ahead of the maximum 1,900MB/s that both of those flash units offer and well ahead of the comparably sized units (the 400GB Intel SSD manages a mere 1,080MB/s, while the 250GB Samsung hits 1,500MB/s). Still, this doesn't sound like 1,000 more performance than flash. What gives? The big difference appears to be in latency and the number of I/O operations the Optane drive supports per second. The P4800X can service up to 550,000 read or 500,000 write operations per second. The older Intel SSD can only service 450,000 reads or 175,000 writes per second and falls to just 75,000 writes for the 400GB unit. The Samsung drive clocks in at 380,000 and 360,000 read and write operations per second (falling to 330,000 and 300,000 for the 250GB version). If raw operations per second are what you need, Optane is already looking strong. The latency figures—the time it takes to actually serve a read and write operation—also look good: the Intel flash SSD has a 20-microsecond latency for any read or write operation, whereas the 3D XPoint drive cuts this to below 10 microseconds. These numbers should hold up better under load, with Intel saying that 99.999 percent of read and write operations will be fulfilled in less than 150 or 200 microseconds (respectively), even with a queue depth of 16. Moreover, most SSDs require a substantial number of I/O operations to be issued to the drive before they can really show off their performance. This can become readily apparent when doing things like copying small files; these are typically copied one by one, with the operating system waiting for one file to complete before starting on the next. In contrast, Intel says that Optane should be able to show off its high performance even with low queue depths. This should mean it can hit its top performance a much greater proportion of the time than flash SSDs do. The other big improvement is in the drive's endurance. Intel's 400GB SSD has a lifetime rating of 7.3 petabytes written, or 10 full drive writes per day. The 250GB Samsung has a warranty that covers only 0.1PB of writes over the drive's lifetime, about 0.1 full drive writes per day. This highlights one of the big differences between enterprise and consumer hardware. The 375GB Optane drive bumps the lifetime rating up to 12.3PB written, or 30 full drive writes per day. As such, the 3D XPoint drive should be much more robust under heavy write workloads. Still, while these numbers do represent improvements on NAND flash, they're a far cry from the promised 1,000-fold improvements. The spec sheet also shows one other disadvantage of the new technology: the 3D XPoint drive draws about 18W when active, as compared to 12W for the 400GB flash SSD or 5.3W for Samsung's 250GB drive. Replace a bunch of NAND drives with Optane and they may well go faster and last longer, but they'll draw more power when doing so. The price and availability of the P4800X are still unknown. In the consumer space, the revised Kaby Lake chipsets are "Optane Ready." Intel is planning an M.2 Optane SSD for suitable motherboards, though information on that is currently non-existent.

Review If you want a touch-screen notebook with a large display, HP's Envy 17 is made for you. Starting at $729 ($1,049 as tested), the 17-inch Envy packs a zippy 7th-Gen Intel CPU with plenty of storage and strong audio performance. However, this machine also suffers from a mushy keyboard and a dim display panel that has a subtle, but unsightly pattern in the background. If you can live with these trade-offs, the Envy is a serviceable choice, but competitors may suit you better. article continued below Design The Envy 17's silver, aluminum body and metallic-hinge lip give it an elegant look. The notebook measures 1-inch thick and weighs 6.6 pounds, which is actually rather light for a laptop this size. HP's laptop is similar to the Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 (0.9 inches, 6.4 pounds). It's noticeably thicker and lighter than the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 (0.7 inches, 4.6 pounds), but with the HP's larger screen, that's to be expected. The Envy 17's large chassis leaves plenty of room for ports. HP placed an Ethernet jack, two USB 3.0 ports and a Super Multi Drive DVD player on the Envy 17's left side, while its third USB 3.0 port, HDMI port, USB Type-C port, SD memory reader and headphone jack sit on the right side. Neither of the Dell laptops offers an Ethernet port or an optical drive.  MORE: Best HP Laptops Display The Envy 17's 1920 x 1080-pixel display may be sharp, but it's plagued by dimness and a subtle grid pattern in the background. Not everyone will notice the grid, as it's most visible on stark-white backgrounds and you have to stare pretty close to see it, but once you've found the pattern, it's hard not to see it. To confirm that our review unit was not defective, we went to our local Best Buy, where the display model had the exact same issue. If you can't detect the pattern (as was true for a colorblind co-worker), you will be pleased with the rich colors and sharp images. When I watched a trailer for The Fate of the Furious, icy blue arctic tundras and orange car explosions really popped. According to our colorimeter, the Envy reproduces a strong 111 percent of the sRGB spectrum. That beats the 62-percent showing by the Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 and edges out the 106-percent score from the Inspiron 17 7000, but it's still below the 125 percent average for desktop replacements. Unfortunately, the HP Envy 17 doesn't get that bright, emitting a maximum of 252 nits (a measurement of brightness). That's slightly above the 244-nit Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1, but it's significantly worse than the 313-nit Inspiron 17 7000 and the 295-nit average for desktop-replacement notebooks. That dim, glossy display leads to poor viewing angles with the color gaining a dark cast when you move 45 degrees to the left or right. The Envy's 17.3-inch touch screen accurately tracked my fingers as I tapped through the desktop and scrolled through web pages. The display also responded quickly to the pinch and pull gestures I used to adjust sites. Keyboard, Touch Screen, Touchpad The Envy 17's keyboard has solid travel, but its weak resistance led me to "bottom out," uncomfortably mashing the base as I typed. When I tested it out on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, I clicked my way to 79 words per minute, just a word off my 80-wpm average. We found that the island-style keys deliver 1.5 millimeters of key travel, which is in our target range (1.5mm-2mm is ideal), but the 50-gram actuation force was short of our minimum of 60 g. That explains why my fingers hit the deck so easily. The notebook's 4.7 x 2.5-inch, buttonless touchpad was a breeze to use, accepting two-finger page-scrolling and three-finger navigation gestures smoothly. The surface offers a solid feel to each click. Audio The Envy 17's massive speaker bar, located above the keyboard, pumped enough sound to fill our large conference room with a solid rendition of Migos' "T-Shirt." The track's bass kicked well, vocals sounded clear and drums hit crisply. The notebook comes with a pre-loaded Bang & Olufsen Audio utility, which allows you to switch presets from the default Music to Movie or Voice. I didn't hear any discernable differences with Movie or Voice, so stick with Music.  MORE: The Best Laptops for Business and Productivity Performance Armed with a 7th-Gen Intel Core i7-7500U processor and 16GB of RAM, this configuration of the Envy 17 had no problem multitasking. I saw smooth, zippy performance after splitting my screen among a dozen Chrome tabs (including ones for TweetDeck, Slack and Google Docs) and a 1080p YouTube video. Adding a full-system scan in Windows Defender couldn't slow the machine either. That 7th-Gen Core i7 CPU pushed the Envy 17 to a solid score of 7,747 on the Geekbench 3 general performance test. Due to their less-powerful, last-gen CPUs, the Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 (Intel Core i5-6200U; 6,499) and Inspiron 17 7000 (Core i7-6500U; 7,029) earned lower scores. The average for desktop-replacement notebooks (17,619) is much higher. Keep in mind that this category also features gaming laptops, some of which utilize desktop CPUS. The Envy 17 we tested may cost $1,049, but it packs a relatively slow, 7,200-rpm, 1TB drive, which you'd normally find in more affordable machines, rather than a speedier SSD. As a result, the Envy 17 needed 1 minute and 45 seconds to finish our file-transfer test, for a speed of 48.5MBps. That may beat the 1TB, 5,400rpm drive (35.1MBps) in the Dell Inspiron 17 7000, but it's outpaced by the 256GB SSD (122.6 MBps drive) in the Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 and the 510.6MBps average for desktop replacements (laptops in this category often have multiple SSDs). In terms of productivity, the Envy 17 turned in a completely average time on our OpenOffice spreadsheet macro test, finishing in 3 minutes and 35 seconds, tying the category average. The Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 and Inspiron 17 7000 took longer, at 4:47 and 4:07, respectively, but the Envy 17 tied the average for desktop-replacement notebooks (3:35). Powered by an Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with 2GB of memory, the HP Envy 17 achieved  95,701 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test. However, the Inspiron 17 7000, which has the same GPU, notched a better score, at 97,422. Meanwhile, the Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 (Intel HD 520 Graphics) netted a measly 64,067. None of the three laptops matched the 128,911 average. The Envy 17 can game (albeit modestly), running the racer Dirt 3 (set to 1920 x 1080 pixels and Medium graphics) at 38 frames per second, clearing our 30-fps playability threshold. The average for desktop-replacement notebooks (62 fps) is significantly greater. Battery Life We're not surprised that the Envy 17 offers only OK battery life for its class, as machines this large typically stay plugged in most of the time. The notebook lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (web surfing at 100 nits), longer than the 4:20 average for desktop-replacement laptops, but shorter than the times for the Inspiron 15 7000 2-in-1 (6:55) and the Dell Inspiron 17 7000 (7:28). MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life Webcam The Envy 17's 0.9-megapixel webcam shoots fuzzy images that capture accurate color. When I shot a selfie in our office, the camera correctly captured the green and yellow of my hat and the red of a wall. However, the image's graininess stripped out most of the details. Heat This HP notebook keeps things cool. After the Envy 17 streamed 15 minutes of full-screen HD video, our heat gun captured temperatures of 81 degrees Fahrenheit on the laptop's touchpad, 85 degrees on the G and H keys, and 91 degrees along the machine's underside. Those temperatures are well beneath our 95-degree comfort threshold. Software Most Windows 10 notebooks come with preloaded bloatware, such as Candy Crush Saga and Netflix, but HP throws in links for the PicsArt app, Priceline.com and the Amazon shopping app. This is the kind of thing you might get used to when buying a new PC, but it shouldn't be that way. HP also tosses in a few proprietary apps, including JumpStart, which explains Windows 10 keyboard shortcuts and system customization. There's also Recovery Manager, which provides maintenance options, and Audio Switch for managing audio output through multiple monitors. Configuration Options HP sells three customizable configurations of the Envy 17, starting with the $729 model that packs a last-generation Core i7-6700HQ CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 1TB and 7,200-rpm hard drive, a 1920 x 1080-pixel nontouch screen, and integrated Intel HD 530 graphics. An upgrade to a touch-screen panel costs $50. You'll need to spend at least $949 to get an Envy with a 7th-Gen CPU. For that price, you get a system with  a Core i7-7500U CPU, 16GB of memory, a 512GB SSD, a 1920 x 1080-pixel touch screen and a 2GB Nvidia GeForce graphics card. The unit we tested is a $1,049 Best Buy exclusive that is identical to the $949 model, but it has a slower, more-spacious 1TB and 7,200-rpm hard drive. I'm hard-pressed to recommend the Best Buy configuration, unless your work demands a lot of local storage. Bottom Line The Envy 17's zippy performance, metallic design, vibrant colors and rich audio make it a laptop that's worth considering. However, the low brightness, awkward grid pattern on the screen and weak keyboard really hold this machine back. If you're looking for a 17-inch touch-screen notebook, you'll probably prefer the Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1, which offers longer battery life and a bright, vibrant display. Just make sure you purchase that laptop with the latest, 7th Generation Intel processor on board. However, if you're willing to live with its compromises, the Envy 17 is worth considering.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement.

Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision."

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties.

Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

President Donald Trump, second from right, and first lady Melania Trump, left, sit down to dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, center, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., Friday, Feb. 10, 2017. Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012.

Susan Walsh AP Photo 1 of 10 i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." - By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. -By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. -By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. -By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Canaccord Genuity on Friday downgraded Intel to hold from buy given the potential for margins to compress as the chipmaker ventures into new markets to seek growth. "We agree with management's long-term decision to invest for growth; however, turning a battleship like Intel takes time and we believe other stocks we cover will generate more attractive returns during this period of prolonged transition …," equity analyst Matthew Ramsay wrote in a research note. He says Intel is likely to get "caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place" as the firm tries to overcome "peak" PC margins and margin compression in its data center group (DCG). "We concede Intel shares generate a strong yield and remain inexpensive, but we believe shares could remain range bound as margins stagnate and until investors see proof of new investments …," he said.

Of course, like any other Intel 200-series motherboard, the GA-B250M-Gaming 5 does support 6th Generation Intel ‘Skylake’ processors as well. The B250M-Gaming 5 motherboard comes equipped with what Gigabyte claims is the most advanced LED system in the market today. The RGB Fusion lighting offers users a choice of 16.8 million colors, two programmable sections, seven different lighting effects, and accent LED with interchangeable overlay. There is support for RGBW light strips as well, so if you feel the factory setup isn’t bright enough for you, you can install standard 12V external RGB or RGBW light strips on the RGBW pin header and then control the color using the RGB Fusion software. Gigabyte has focused on audio performance as well with this board, integrating ALC 1220 codec 120dB SNR HD Audio with a smart headphone amp and USB DAC-UP 2 solution. In terms of storage connectivity, the board includes six SATA 6 Gb/s ports and a 32 Gb/s M.2 slot for the latest ultra-fast NVMe solid state drives. USB connectivity includes a total of 6 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and 5 USB 2.0/1.1 ports. Expansion slots include 1 PCI Express x16 slot running at x16, 1 PCI Express x16 slot running at x4, and 2 PCI Express x1 slots. Other key specifications include Intel GbE LAN chip, AMD Quad-GPU CrossFireX/ 2-way AMD CrossFire support, four DDR4 DIMM slots, and GIGABYTE dual-UEFI BIOS.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." - By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. -By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. -By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. -By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process.

Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way.

"This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow.

But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington.

In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.

The financial arm of computing firm Intel is investing $250 million in autonomous vehicle technology, targeting three areas that the company’s leader believes will place Intel at the forefront of an approaching wave of change in transportation. “Just as oil has transformed our world over the last century, data is poised to transform our world for the next hundred years — and beyond,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a blog post on the company’s webpage, posted in November to coincide with the announcement of the investment. “When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, data is literally the new oil,” he said. “Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience: as consumers, as automakers, as technologists and as citizens of our communities.” BEST OF FEBRUARY iTECH: More stories, columns In a statement, Intel said the initiative is being handled by its Intel Capital financial division, which since 1991 has invested more than $11.8 billion in nearly 1,500 companies in 57 countries. Of those companies, 214 have gone public globally and more than 400 were acquired or included in a merger, Intel said. This autonomous vehicle initiative, Intel said, will “drive the development of technologies that push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” Drilling down into specifics, the statement highlighted the development of the Internet of Things, or IoT, in transportation; safety technologies that can help mitigate risk while also improving mobility and efficiency, and companies that harness data to improve the reliability of automated driving systems. 1 2 3 Next >> By the Information Technology & Logistics Council Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Ake. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process.

Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Update: AMD Ryzen chips won’t support Windows 7 after all 02/09/2017 at 9:51 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment AMD’s upcoming Ryzen processors are expected to be up to 40 percent faster than the company’s previous chips, giving Intel’s high-end desktop processors a run for their money. And, as we reported earlier this month, an article fom German site ComputerBase suggested AMD processors might also offer something Intel’s latest chips don’t: official support for Windows 7. But now AMD says that’s not true. PC World reports that the company did test its Ryzen chips with the older version of Windows, AMD only plans to release and support drivers for Windows 10. That’s consistent with reports from last year that said both AMD’s Zen chips and Intel’s Kaby Lake processors would only officially support Windows 10. While a growing number of Windows users are running the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system, about 39 percent of users were still running Windows 7 in November, according to Microsoft’s own numbers, even though mainstream support for the operating system ended in 2015. Microsoft does plan to continue offering extended support for Windows 7 for three more years, but most new PCs are sold with Windows 10 pre-loaded, which means the people most affected by the lack of official support for Windows 7 will be folks who either want to build their own computers or downgrade the OS on a pre-built system. The first AMD Ryzen chips are expected to ship in March.

The chipmaker is "investing heavily" in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company's investor day on Thursday. "We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there," Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. [ Further reading: The 8080 chip at 40: What's next for the mighty microprocessor ] Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore's Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore's Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore's Law is slowly dying, and Intel's manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel's business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis -- which all chipmakers face -- is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model -- known as the Von Neumann approach -- involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich's comments lend more credibility to the company's push to look at a future beyond today's computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel's new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have been researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It's similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the U.K. are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.

Intel is reportedly targeting Optane at server platforms and small-capacity cache devices, rather than full-sized SSDs, on the desktop. We now have a better idea of how an Optane datacenter device might perform, at least. Tom's Hardware reports that several Chinese-language media outlets have obtained performance specifications for the purported P4800X device, a 375GB 3D XPoint PCIe SSD designed for data centers. The P4800X's peak sequential throughput is comparable to NAND NVMe devices, but the device's reported latency and endurance figures are a big step forward from existing SSDs. Source: Techbang.com Intel claims 2400 MB/s sequential reads and 2000 MB/s sequential writes for the P4800X, which are competitve but not revolutionary. Intel's current 400 GB P3700 drive achieves sequential speeds up to 2800 MB/s when reading and 2000 MB/s when writing. The 3D XPoint device's reported 550,000 4K read IOPS is another nice improvement, but it's not a huge leap over the 400 GB P3700's 460,000 figure, either. The 3D XPoint device shines when we examine some other specifications. The 375GB P4800X can reportedly achieve 500,000 4K write IOPS, compared to the P3700's more pedestrian 175,000. The P4800X's reported 10µs latency is half of the older drive's specification, too. The P4800X could also boast 30 drive writes per day of endurance. The P3700 touts a 17 DWPD figure, which is already quite high for a NAND SSD. Intel's previous-generation P3600 was rated for a scant 3 drive write cycles per day. The P4800X is reportedly run by an Intel controller and firmware. Pricing and availability were not a part of the leaked information, but we suspect Intel will demand a hefty premium for the improved latency and endurance the drives appear to have on tap.   Tags: Storage Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak AMD Ryzen Lineup & Prices Confirmed, 8 Cores For As Low As $320 By Khalid Moammer Feb 8, 2017 1873Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD’s entire Ryzen CPU lineup has been verified and pricing for its 8 core SKUs confirmed through various online retailers. Last week we finally got a look at the full Ryzen lineup comprised of 17 different CPUs that AMD will be rolling-out. Thanks to comments by AMD’s President & CEO Lisa Su at the company’s last earnings call, we know that that they’re officially launching Ryzen at the end of the month with expected on-shelf availability on March 2nd. It’s not entirely clear yet whether the March 2nd launch will include all 17 Ryzen SKUs. However, what is apparent is that at least three different CPUs will be available on day one. These include the Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700. All three of these have been listed online and are available for pre-order on a number of online retailers. All three SKUs feature 8 cores and 16 threads. The most affordable of which, the Ryzen 7 1700 is up for sale with a list price of less than $320. The Ryzen Revolution – i7 6900K Class Performance For 1/3rd The Price & Less Than Half The Power Of the several online retailers that have listed Ryzen CPUs one in particular stands out. It’s shopblt.com, the very same retailer that accurately listed pretty much every AMD CPU right before release. Including the Athlon X4 845 and the Kaveri A10 7850K and A10 7700K chips. Not only that, but its prices were also spot on, exactly matching the official MSRPs at launch. Perhaps it has proven accurate time and time again because it retrieves product pricing data from the database of one of the biggest channel suppliers in the world. With that preface in mind, let’s dig into the details that you’ve all been waiting for. The three chips that have been spotted are all 8 core and 16 thread SKUs as previously mentioned. The 1800X and the 1700X are 95W chips and and the 1700 is rated at 65 watts. That’s right folks, AMD is launching an 8 core, 16 thread CPU with a boost clock of 3.7GHz and a TDP of 65 watts. That’s less than half the TDP of Intel’s 140W 8 core 16 thread i7 6900K, which features the same 3.7GHz boost clock speed. As if thosse figures aren’t mind boggling enough, this chip is listed at less than $320. Which comes in at one fourth the cost of its Intel rival, which regularly retails for over $1100. To put the enormity of this into perspective, you would practically be able build an entire high-end gaming machine around the Ryzen 1700 for the same money that would cost you just to get an i7 6900K chip on its own. AMD’s highest performing Ryzen CPU, the 1800X will retail for less than $499. A piece of information we made public nearly three months ago in our exclusive Ryzen report. So we know that much hasn’t changed since November. What was a bit of a surprise however is the fact that AMD’s 8 core flagship will boost to a whopping 4.0GHz right out of the box despite a frugal 95W TDP. AMD Confirms All Ryzen CPUs Are Unlocked & Overclocking Ready The third Ryzen chip is the 1700X and it comes in between the 1800X and the 1700 in terms of pricing and clock speeds. What you’ll notice is that Ryzen chips with the -X suffix are rated at 95W whilst their equivalents without the X at the end are simply more energy efficient variants with a lower 65W TDP. However, all Ryzen CPUs without exception feature fully unlocked frequency multipliers. And because pretty much all AM4 motherboards support overclocking, with the exception of the low-end A series chipsets, you can rest assured knowing that no matter which Ryzen CPU you pick up you will be able to overclock it to your heart’s content. That is if you choose to do so. Advertisement Ryzen In The Mid-range and Mainstream Segments Considering that in a month’s time you will be able to pick up a Ryzen CPU for $320 with performance that’s confined to the ultra luxury one thousand dollars+ segment of the desktop market today, it’s suffice to say that mid-range and mainstream segments of the market are about to witness the most profound shift we have seen yet in the CPU market. At less than $300 unlocked six core, twelve thread enthusiast Ryzen CPUs will compete with Intel’s unlocked and locked quad-core, four thread i5s. Quad-core 8 thread Ryzen CPUs will completely displace Intel’s lower-end i5s and the more expensive dual core i3s. Full quad-core Ryzen CPUs will go up against dual core Pentiums. At every given price point AMD’s Ryzen lineup is set to offer nearly double the cores and threads whilst maintaining similar single-threaded performance and power efficiency to the competition. AMD Ryzen CPU Cores/Threads TDP Base/Boost Clock Speed Price AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 95W 3.6/4.0Ghz $499 AMD Ryzen 7 1800 8/16 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 95W 3.4/3.8Ghz $389 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 65W TBA/3.7Ghz $319 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 95W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6/12 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1500 6/12 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1400X 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1300 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1200X 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1200 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1100 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AM4 And The X370, B350, X300 And A300 Chipsets The company kicked things off at CES 2017 with a motherboard showcase featuring 18 different models from ASRock, ASUS, BIOSTAR, GIGABYTE and MSI. The motherboards on display ranged from high-end enthusiast class models with X370 chipsets in the heart of everyone of them to mid-range B350 based designs as well as entry level boards sporting the A320 and A300 chipsets. ASRock X370 Taichi, ASRock X370 Gaming K4, ASRock AB350 Gaming K4 & ASRock A320M Pro4 ASUS B350M-C BIOSTAR X370GT7, BIOSTAR X350GT5 & BIOSTAR X350GT3 GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming K5, GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming 5, GIGABYTE AB350-Gaming 3 & GIGABYTE A320M-HD3 MSI A320M Pro-VD, MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium, MSI B350 Tomahawk & MSI B350M Mortar Nvidia GTX 1070 Memory Issue To Be Addressed Via BIOS Update Ryzen compatible AM4 socket motherboards will come in four different chipset flavors. The X370 chipset is the high-end enthusiast focused contender with the latest and greatest technology and the most robust set of features. The B350 is the mid-range chipset where users will be able to get a lot of functionality and versatility at a more attractive price point. The A300 chipset is the entry-level chipset for more budget constrained computer builds. Then we have the X300, which is a new kind of chipset for AMD. It’s the company’s high-end offering for small form factor motherboards i.e. Mini-ITX and Micro-ATX form factor boards. That’s right, you will be able to cram an 8 core monster i7 6900K class CPU, in a tiny mini-itx board and build incredibly powerful small-form factor PCs with Ryzen. The Enthusiast X370 Chipset We know that many of you reading this will have already seen the demos and read up on the speeds and feeds and are probably interested in learning more about AMD’s newly announced high-end chipset. We’re pleased to say that it does not disappoint. It’s a truly modern chipset with support for the latest memory and storage technologies. Features of the X370 chipset include : Support for M.2 SATA SSDs NVMe 4 DDR4 memory slots (dual channel DDR4) 24 PCIe Gen 3 lanes (from the CPU). 16 PCIe Gen 3 lanes dedicated for graphics with support for up to 3-way CrossFireX & 2-way SLI. 4 PCIe Gen 3 lanes dedicated for storage (NVMe, SATA & PCIe storage) 4 PCIe Gen 3 dedicated for LAN & USB3.1 Gen 2 ports. 8 PCIe Gen 2 lanes (from the chipset) 10 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (4 from the CPU and 6 from the chipset) 2 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports 6 USB 2 ports. 6 SATA3 6Gb/s ports (2 from the CPU and 4 from the chipset) This is a huge improvement compared to the company’s current AM3+ and FM2+ stack. We’re talking DDR4 vs DDR3, native NVMe and M.2 support as well as USB 3.1 Gen2. Ryzen has been one of AMD’s most eagerly anticipated products and arguably its most important one in a decade. The new CPU breaks new ground for the Sunnyvale California based chip maker in many ways. It’s the company’s first ever microarchitecture to feature simultaneous multi-threading. It’s built on a process technology that’s as close as ever to parity with Intel since the days of the original Athlon in the early 2000s. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, it’s incredibly competitive. Whether its performance, power efficiency or features, Ryzen easily holds its own against Intel’s best.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel Responds to AMD's Ryzen Onslaught with Core i7 and i5 Updates PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 10 2017 AMD is getting ready to roll out its new Ryzen CPUs, promising significantly improved performance not only over AMD's previous processor line but also in comparison to the best that Intel currently has to offer. AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Russian Hackers Get Burned in Deal Next Article > Salesforce Ties Its CRM into Quip Productivity Suite By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 CRM giant Salesforce introduced several new features to its Quip productivity platform this week, including a new way to import CRM (customer relationship management) data directly into Quip documents and spreadsheets. The changes will help increase productivity and allow users to collaborate with each other more easily, according to Salesforce. "Quip is extending the power of Salesforce with a sleek, next-generation productivity solution designed for teams -- empowering everyone across an organization with the tools they need to collaborate more effectively, work smarter and supercharge their productivity,”" the company said in a statement. The Hyper-Connected Workplace Salesforce said Quip's new features come in response to the hyper-connected nature of the modern workplace, in which employees are forced to sort through disconnected email threads, to-do lists and applications to gather information they need while the work itself happens somewhere else. "According to IDC, knowledge workers spend 61 percent of their workweek answering email, searching for information and communicating internally," Salesforce said. "Additionally, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates companies can raise, through new technologies, the productivity of knowledge workers by up to 25 percent." To help achieve those numbers, the company introduced several new features to the Quip platform, including new integrations for Salesforce users, a new checklist and an improved user experience. Importing Salesforce Data into Quip The live data feature allows users to import CRM data from Salesforce, such as account values and service cases, to Quip documents. Once in Quip, the information automatically syncs with Salesforce. For example, with a single export, sales reps can generate forecasting spreadsheets that will be updated with the most recent Salesforce data, the company said. The Quip Lightning component, meanwhile, enables teams to link, access and create Quip documents, spreadsheets and task lists directly from within Salesforce. This allows users to find and collaborate on documents within the context of their businesses. For example, a sales rep will be able to quickly create a task list within an opportunity record to ensure the team is aligned on the final steps necessary to close the deal. With Quip checklists users can manage projects inside Quip with tasks that go beyond owners and due dates. Quip users can enhance everyday workflows by adding reminders to anything, from spreadsheet rows that need to be updated to drafts waiting for review. In addition, an all new sidebar environment and contextual menus include new document, spreadsheet and checklist tools that can adapt to the work users are doing. "We're proud to debut a new, smarter Quip that anticipates a team's needs like never before," said Bret Taylor, CEO of Quip, a Salesforce company, in the statement. "By bringing the power of dynamic business data into living documents, we'e introducing the next generation of team productivity and collaboration." Quip's new user experience and Quip checklists are already available for all Quip users at no extra cost. Quip Connect, including the live data feature and the Quip Lightning component, will be available for users of Quip Enterprise and Salesforce on the AppExchange later this month.

Here's what we know about Intel's mystery 8th-gen processors so far. The juicy information was revealed during Intel’s annual investor meeting, with Intel execs teasing plenty of interesting information about where they’re expecting the company to go in the next 12 months. What is Intel up to? Let’s take a step back: why does this matter to you and the laptop or PC purchase you’re thinking of making this year? You may have heard of “7th-gen Intel Core”, otherwise known as Kaby Lake. This is the marketing name for the latest generation of Intel Core i processors you’ll find in new PCs and laptops, and represents the followup to 6th-gen Skylake. Related: Intel Core i explained This new 8th-gen chip? It's previously unknown to us and fits into a gap we didn’t know existed. This unnamed 8th-gen chip uses a 14-nanometre (nm) “process”. At its most basic, the smaller the process the more efficient the processor is, allowing you to squeeze more transistors onto the same-sized piece of silicon. Silicon is expensive, so fitting more of the ultra-important transistors onto them means you can make more efficient use of each little piece. The process of making smaller transistors is also expensive, so Intel has used this 14nm architecture for its 5th-gen Broadwell, 6th-gen Skylake and 7th-gen Kaby Lake products. This new product will use the same 14nm size and, like with all previous advancements, will take advantage of new technology to make the process even more efficient. Intel's strategy so far Here’s what we thought we knew about Intel’s processor road map: Early 2017: 14nm Kaby Lake 2017: 14nm Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X (Extreme, enthusiast chips) Late 2017: 10nm Cannonlake 2018: 14nm Coffee Lake Yesterday’s announcement seems to have turned that on its head. Barring the 'X' series enthusiast updates to Skylake and Kaby Lake, we weren’t expecting another 14nm chip in 2017, so to see one suddenly appear in the second half of this year is surprising. Intel says the new 8th-gen chips will be 15% more powerful than Kaby Lake, which in turn it claims are 15% more powerful than Skylake. That’s a decent boost, especially when you consider many people will own PCs and laptops with much older Intel processors on board. So is this the Coffee Lake mentioned above? We don’t know. Coffee Lake was rumoured to be a set of six-core processors. If this announcement was indeed Coffee Lake, you’d expect the gains to be somewhat more than 15% versus Kaby Lake. It also isn't "Cannonlake", because that architecture is based on a 10nm process while this new mystery one is, as we mentioned, still 14nm. Frankly, and we’re sure you’ll agree, this is all getting a bit ridiculous as – among other things – Intel has thrown a massive spanner in the works for people waiting for AMD’s hotly anticipated Ryzen architecture. How will it all stack up in the end? We just don’t know, but keep your eyes and ears open for more 8th-gen Intel news in the near future. If you're buying a new laptop or PC in the second half of this year, be sure to bookmark this page as we'll be adding all the details as we get them. We've reached out to Intel for clarification on its strategy and will update this piece if the company responds.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop By Joel Hruska on February 10, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel announced that it had created a new type of non-volatile memory in partnership with Micron, dubbed 3D XPoint, there have been questions about how the new memory would perform and what kind of systems might ship it in the future. The ostensible draw of alternative memory technologies like 3D XPoint (Intel markets its drives under the Optane brand) is that it can offer non-volatile storage performance at speeds more comparable to DRAM, but with better power consumption. Discussions on cost are less certain — right now, Intel and Micron are focused on introducing the technology and it’ll be fairly expensive for the near-term future. Long-term price is an unknown — the sheer economy of scale around NAND flash makes it difficult for any new storage technology to challenge in terms of cost-per-GB. Now, however, we have some idea how Optane will perform, at least in Intel’s initial data center SSD. Intel’s P4800X series is a 375GB drive with sequential read/write speeds of 2400MB/s and 2000MB/s respectively. Random 4KB IOPS are rated at 550K/s for reads and 500K/s for writes. Overclockers3D points out that this compares extremely favorably with Samsung’s 960 Pro SSD, which offers up to 330K IOPS for random 4KB reads and writes. Still, it’s worth bearing in mind that IOPS are substantially meaningless without a great deal of information about how the tests were conducted and how the workloads were designed. On their own, they don’t tell us much. One thing we do know, however, is that Optane can deliver excellent performance even with a queue depth of 1. Queue depth refers the number of commands that can be queued within a storage controller at the same time. A queue depth of 32 is commonly used when testing desktop applications and software, and as you can see, a queue depth of 1 produces poor performance on an SSD. Queue depth of 1 on the left, 32 on the right. CrystalDiskMark is a simple test, but it illustrates this issue well enough. The graph above is from my own system, using a spare SSD I’ve got installed. At a queue depth of 32, the SSD is 7.82x faster than with a queue depth of 1 in 4K random reads. The gap between write speed is less dramatic, but QD=32 is still 2.23x faster than QD=1. Typically, storage workloads stack up large queue depths and high-end hardware controllers can handle far more than the 32 queues specified in SATA — but if Optane can deliver excellent performance at low queue depths as well as high, it could prove a potent competitor in any workload dominated by such metrics. These are the first Optane drives, and they’re intended for data centers, not consumers. Intel does have plans to make Kaby Lake accelerators available to customers with a Z270 chipset, but pricing and availability have not been announced. Now read: How do SSDs work?

In the most surprising bit of news, Eassa confirmed that the next generation of Intel Core processors will once again be built on 14-nm technology. In a reply to Anandtech's Ian Cutress, he also reported that Intel's Vice President and General Manager of Client and IoT says that "process tech use will be fluid based on segment and what makes sense." Confirmed with Intel that 8th Gen Core will use updated/enhanced 14nm technology again -- basically 14nm++. — Ashraf Eassa (@TMFChipFool) February 9, 2017 @IanCutress Yeah, as Murthy referred to it at the event, process tech use will be "fluid" based on segment and what makes sense. — Ashraf Eassa (@TMFChipFool) February 9, 2017 Intel slide from Ashraf Eassa Those two bits of news don't seem to mesh all that well on their own, but Diane Bryant (Intel's Executive Vice President and General Manager of its Data Center division) displayed a slide with the statement "data center first for next process node" during the same presentation. That move could imply that rather than letting its Xeons lag an architectural generation during production on the same process as consumer parts, Intel could mean to fab Xeons on a higher-density process first to achieve higher performance and, in turn, higher selling prices and margins from customers thanks to those chips' favored status in its foundry roadmap. It would also imply that Intel's consumer chips will no longer follow a predictable "process-architecture-optimization" model. Attentive gerbils are no doubt already counting on their fingers, since this means the "8th-generation" Intel Core processors will be the fourth series to be fabricated on a 14-nm process. As we saw with Kaby Lake, Intel's process optimizations alone don't tend to offer large performance improvements over the previous generation. If the company isn't making significant architectural changes in the new chips, we might be in for another mild improvement. Alternatively, considering the statement regarding "fluid" process tech usage, we may be seeing some mixture of 14-nm and 10-nm process technologies across various product segments. Intel's product stack is already confusing, but it may soon become downright convoluted. Speculation aside, it seems unlikely we'll be seeing 10-nm desktop chips anytime soon.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Should you still buy this chipmaker after its near-500% rally over the past 12 months? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Feb 10, 2017 at 10:10AM Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently surged after the chipmaker posted strong fourth quarter numbers, topped off with solid guidance. Revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion, beating estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.01 topped expectations by a penny, and represented a major improvement from its loss of $0.10 per share in the year ago quarter. For the first quarter, AMD expects revenue to rise 18% annually -- crushing analyst estimates for 2% growth. Image source: AMD. Those numbers look solid, but investors looking at AMD's 460% rally over the past 12 months might be wondering if most of that good news is already priced in. Let's take a closer look at AMD's recovery, and see if it's sensible to buy AMD at its highest price in over eight years. A closer look at AMD's growth AMD's quarterly revenue has risen annually for three straight quarters, marking a remarkable rebound from seven straight quarters of declines. Much of that growth was fueled by the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which produces SoCs for non-PC products like Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That demand is expected to rise this year as both companies launch upgraded consoles for 4K and VR gaming. Revenue from the EESC business rose 4% annually to $506 million last quarter, but operating income fell 20% to $47 million due to higher R&D investments. In the past, the strength of the EESC business offset the relative weakness of the Computing and Graphics unit, which produces x86 CPUs and GPUs. Both product lines have traditionally struggled against Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. But last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue rose 28% annually to $600 million on robust sales of its new Polaris-based RX 400 series GPUs. At the time of its launch, the $200 RX 480 was the cheapest VR-capable card on the market -- making it possible to build Rift and Vive-ready desktops for under $1,000. The unit's operating loss of $21 million was also an improvement from its loss of $99 million a year earlier. The RX 480. Image source: AMD. The bull case for AMD Looking ahead, many AMD bulls believe that rising sales of PC and console-based VR headsets can simultaneously lift sales of its custom SoCs and discrete GPUs this year. They also expect AMD's next-gen CPU, Ryzen, to outperform Intel's top-tier i7 processors when they arrive in March, and that its high-end Vega GPUs will outperform NVIDIA's premium tier of Pascal-powered GeForce GPUs. If the Ryzen and Vega chips can achieve those lofty goals, AMD's Computing and Graphics unit could become the company's core growth engine again. AMD could also benefit from the upcoming expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA. Intel hasn't been keen on renewing that agreement, which boosts NVIDIA's revenue by $66 million per quarter, and rumors suggest that Intel could sign a comparable licensing deal with AMD instead. AMD also narrowed its losses, reduced its debt, and boosted its cash position in fiscal 2016. Those achievements all counter the bearish argument that AMD's losses will widen, causing it to collapse under its debt load as its cash flows dry up. Lastly, AMD stock remains fundamentally cheap after its massive rally in 2016. It trades with an EV/Sales ratio of 2.8, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. That valuation -- along with its enterprise value of $11.6 billion -- make it a potential buyout or merger target for larger chipmakers. The bear case against AMD Those potential catalysts all sound encouraging, but there are also reasons to avoid AMD. First, console sales could stall if consumer demand for 4K and VR games is weaker than expected. Early sales estimates for VR headsets suggest that demand for smartphone and console-based headsets is outweighing demand for PC-based ones. While that could boost AMD's EESC business, it could throttle demand for its VR-ready GPUs. Meanwhile, Nintendo's upcoming launch of the Switch, which is powered by an NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC, could also disrupt Sony and Microsoft's console sales as the original Wii did a decade ago. Lastly, too much of AMD's future relies on the Ryzen challenging Intel's GPUs and the Vega countering NVIDIA's. While the Ryzen might beat Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors, there's no guarantee that it can topple Intel's 10nm Cannonlake processors, which will launch in late 2017. Likewise, the Vega might beat NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs, but it could be crushed by NVIDIA's next-gen Volta, which is also expected to launch this year. This means that the Ryzen and Vega could respectively become top-tier CPUs and GPUs this year, but those victories might be short lived. My verdict: Start a small position... for now I believe that investors with a higher tolerance for risk could start partial positions in AMD at current prices. But I also believe that the chipmaker's future growth depends on it bowling a near-perfect game this year -- which could be very tough as Intel and NVIDIA launch their new competing chips.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Feb 10, 2017 at 10:05AM It doesn't matter where you've been; it only matters where you're going. That saying offers a useful starting place for comparing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Though Micron shares trounced those of Intel over the past 12 months, can investors expect a similar performance in the year ahead? INTC data by YCharts To get a better sense of how Intel and Micron Technology stocks compare today, let's run these two semiconductor giants through a three-part analysis to see whose shares are the better buy today. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Financial fortitude In terms of financial stability, Intel has a clear advantage over Micron: Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Micron Technologies $4.3 billion $9.6 billion $3.1 billion 1.7 Intel $32.3 billion $11.7 billion $19.1 billion 1.8 Data sources: Intel and Micron investor relations  Though it carries slightly more debt than Micron, Intel's ability to service its outstanding liabilities with either its cash and investments on hand or its cash from operations gives it far more flexibility than Micron in planning out its future. Debt is not a bad thing in and of itself -- in fact, it can be hugely beneficial under the right circumstances -- but Intel's lower debt level relative to its assets and cash flow make it less risky than Micron. But Micron looks stable enough. Though no hard-and-fast rule exists, the fact that it could, in theory, erase the majority of its liabilities with cash on hand and a year's worth of cash flow makes it leveraged but stable. In terms of the quick ratio, both companies are safe as well. Winner: Intel. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Competitive analysis Though the companies have a long history of working together, Intel and Micron are very different businesses. Most important, Intel enjoys a much stronger competitive position within its two core markets than Micron:  INTC Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts Intel's financial performance is fueled mostly by its two core operating groups: the PC client group and the data center group. Together, they account for about 85% of Intel's sales. Moreover, Intel's chips are the de facto standard in PCs and data centers worldwide. Market share estimates vary, but Intel is thought to control about 85% of the PC processor market and at least 95% of the server chip space. Its technological leadership in each market affords Intel a fair amount of pricing power, which it then reinvests into its business in the form of a massive research and development budget, creating a virtuous cycle and enabling Intel's continued technological leadership in both markets. This isn't the perfect business model, but it does make Intel a model of consistency and profitability, something that can't be said of Micron. Micron's tenuous competitive position is largely a function the memory market as a whole. Because memory is a commodity product, the industry is characterized by several large incumbents, of which Micron is the third largest, trying to match marketwide supply with demand. When supply exceeds demand, unit prices decline, which can lead to heavy losses among memory manufacturers. We saw this scenario play out in 2015 and 2016, triggering a painful sell-off in Micron shares. Now with that trend reversing, Micron should return to profitability, which has been the driving force behind the impressive rally its stock has enjoyed since mid-2016. Yet even so, Micron remains at the mercy of the broader industry dynamics of the memory market, which makes Intel the easy winner here, as far as competitive advantages go. Winner: Intel. Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Valuation analysis Reconciling businesses outlooks with valuations makes for an interesting analysis here. Let's look at how three commonly used valuation metrics appear for Micron Technology and Intel. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Micron Technologies N/A 8.6 9.7 Intel 17.7 12.4 7.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Comparing the two requires a bit of nuance. Micron's flip from loss to profit is captured in its current and forward earnings multiples. As we've seen, Micron is risky, but it's also cheap when viewed on a forward basis -- cheaper than Intel. The decision here comes down to a matter of preference. More aggressive investors might see Micron's volatility as an opportunity to profit. However, Intel still seems quite cheap, given the durability and profitability of its lead microprocessor franchises. Winner: Tie. And the winner is... Intel From a risk-reward standpoint, Micron has more of both. To me, investing in an enduring franchise in Intel is more desirable than the roller coaster-like cyclicality that drives Micron's performance. By winning two of the three categories outright and enjoying a more stable business model, Intel seems like the better stock to buy today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 10, 2017 at 11:42AM On Feb. 9, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hosted its annual investor meeting, during which the company went over its long-term strategies and business objectives in each of its core business units. Intel's second-largest business unit by revenue, and arguably its most important business for the long term, is its data center group (DCG). The business is attractive for a couple of key reasons. First, it's a large business that still has the potential to deliver meaningful growth. And, perhaps just as importantly, it's extremely profitable, with operating margins coming in at nearly 44% in 2016. Intel server chips. Image source: Intel. In her presentation, DCG chief Diane Bryant talked about how the company expects its profit margins in DCG to come down in the coming years -- something that was likely responsible for the drop in the company's share price in the wake of the investor meeting. Here, I'd like to go over the key reasons for why Intel expects that drop in DCG profitability and why investors shouldn't freak out about it. DCG gets the shiny new manufacturing tech first Historically, when Intel would introduce new manufacturing technologies, the first products to get them would be its personal computer processors. And, recently, it would be the very low-power chips aimed at slim notebooks and 2-in-1 devices that would get the latest technologies, with higher-performance personal computers getting them a bit later. That's all about to change going forward. According to Bryant, the first products to get new manufacturing technologies will be those produced by DCG. It's going to take a little while for DCG to "take the lead," but Bryant indicated that the company's server processors would be the first to adopt its third-generation 10-nanometer technology called 10-nanometer++ and then the follow-on technology known as 7-nanometer. The good news here is that since the chips that Intel's DCG produces are sold to customers willing to pay more for higher performance and additional features. Additionally, as competition heats up in the server market (a lot of companies want a piece of the action that Intel currently dominates), Intel is going to want every potential competitive advantage that it can get. However, this will come at a cost to the company. In the past, Intel would have the benefit of having run its easier-to-manufacture consumer chips on the new technology first, ironing out the kinks and improving manufacturing yields before DCG got to use it. Now, the processors produced by DCG will have to bear that burden -- negatively impacting gross profit margins and, ultimately, operating profit margins. A bigger operating expense burden Intel also indicated that another headwind to DCG operating margin going forward is that DCG will see an "increased allocation of corporate expenses." Remember that the bulk of Intel's research and development spending goes toward "shared" technology development -- that is, on technologies that are used by all of Intel's major business groups such as processors, memory controllers, and other intellectual properties. Since DCG is becoming a larger part of Intel's revenue mix, its share of those common research and development expenses will now go up, too. This increase in operating expenses attributable to DCG is naturally going to negatively impact operating profits and therefore operating margin. Ramp of non-CPU products Between 2017 and 2021, Intel expects that revenue from its server CPU business will grow at a 6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). It expects an overall revenue growth CAGR in the "low-double-digit" percentage range during that time, with the rest of the growth coming from non-CPU products. These non-CPU products, according to Intel, should carry lower gross profit margins than the CPU products do. So, although those products should boost DCG revenue and total operating profit, they should also dilute the average gross profit margin of that business, which in turn should lead to a reduction in operating margin. Don't panic It is clearly disappointing in the near term that Intel is expecting reduced profit margins in DCG. That, coupled with the company's new long-term revenue CAGR expectations in the "low-double-digit" percentage range (down from a previous goal of 15%), is certainly going to ding sentiment around this business. Nevertheless, the moves that Intel is doing here are the correct ones. DCG products should use Intel's latest manufacturing technology advances, particularly as competition heats up, and it's only fair that DCG take on more of the shared operating expense burden given that it's becoming a bigger part of Intel's business. And finally, while the shift in revenue mix from CPU to non-CPU products is clearly expected to dilute gross profit margin, the ramp-up of those products should add to total revenue and gross profit dollars -- it's generally better to have a slightly lower margin percentage on a much higher revenue base than to have a slightly higher-margin percentage on a significantly lower revenue base. In other words, relax -- Intel is making the right moves for the long term.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

clock menu more-arrow Chromebook Pro: life in beta The nightmare before the dream by Dieter Bohn@backlon Feb 10, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Let's talk about dreams. As a technology reviewer, I have weird ones — both literally and metaphorically. I spend a lot of time testing a wide array of gadgets, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. So the temptation arises to look at them and wish that this tablet could have that laptop's browser or this smartwatch could have that phone's connectivity features. The engineers at Google apparently dream the same way, because they have been spending the last six months or so bringing Android apps to Chrome OS. Android phones have a ton of great apps, but their web browsers pale in comparison to what you can get on a Chromebook. And vice versa: web apps are great, but there are times when it's just not enough, you need a "real" app. This new hybrid system that Google is creating is not a full merging of the two operating systems (which is starting to look less realistic and less desirable by the day), but it could provide all the benefits people dream of when they ask Google to merge Chrome OS and Android. The new Chromebook Pro is the convertible laptop that's supposed to be the first true manifestation of that dream. It's a $549, Intel-based device coming out in April. And maybe by then, it will be the dream made real. But because its software is still in beta right now, it's not a dream at all. It's the other thing. It's a nightmare. This is not a review of the Samsung Chromebook Pro. It's not a review because the Chromebook Pro is not ready to be reviewed yet. What you're about to read is just a story about what technology is like when you're living on the bleeding edge, a tale about software that will (hopefully) ever only be inflicted on tech reviewers and engineers. Beta software is a funny thing. The default advice I give people is to avoid it, but sometimes the siren call of something new and exciting is too much, and often betas are totally usable. Early betas of iOS are too unstable for daily use, but the later ones generally aren't that bad. Same applies for Android betas lately. And heck, once upon a time even stalwart apps like Gmail kept the beta label on for five years. For consumer use, there are good betas and there are bad betas. There are good betas and bad betas. This is a bad beta Another example of a pretty good beta is the software on the Chromebook Plus, the companion device to the one I'm writing about here. It, too, features Android software, but since it has an ARM processor that software is a little less buggy. And since the Plus is theoretically a lower-end device and getting released with that beta software, its foibles are slightly more forgivable. I've reviewed the Chromebook Plus in full here. I'm belaboring all this because what I'm about to describe to you is an experience that you will hopefully never have as a consumer — assuming Google gets its act together. Again, this Chromebook Pro isn't coming out until April, and between now and then Google has insisted to me that everything I'm about to describe is both a known issue and will be fixed. Luckily, Google is working off a very good foundation. Samsung has manufactured a great Chromebook. The Chromebook Pro has a gorgeous touchscreen, a thin metal frame, and an accurate trackpad. The keyboard is good — but sadly not backlit — and it comes with a stylus. The only real difference between the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus is that the Pro has a more powerful Intel processor. There's one cosmetic difference, too: the Pro will be black when it's released; the photos and video you see here are of a silver preproduction unit. Taken just as a Chrome OS device, running the Chrome browser and web apps, I think the Chromebook Pro is going to be great. It can handle running nearly 20 tabs before it starts to slow down, and has a battery that just won't quit. What slowdowns I have experienced have come because there are problems with the Android software that can sometimes affect the rest of the OS. So let's get into the Android app situation. The way Android on Chrome OS works is something like this: Android apps expect to see Android hardware, so Chrome OS acts as a software layer that provides those Android apps everything they need: Wi-Fi, RAM, time from the processor, etc. It's not really emulation, it's more deeply integrated than that. So, for example, Android notifications are fully integrated into Chrome OS's own notification tray. You can also copy / paste from Chrome tabs into Android apps and vice versa. Android can run on both ARM and Intel processors, but the vast majority of Android apps expect to have an ARM processor. That means that the more complex apps — like games — are optimized for ARM and have to be translated on the fly to run on Intel. Chrome OS does that work for them, but it's not really good at it yet. Google itself suggested we try out a game that is pretty commonly used to see if Android devices can display graphics well: 2013’s Asphalt 8. So I dutifully did and the Chromebook Pro dutifully did its best to run the game. But it couldn't keep up with the game engine. The game sputtered along with so many frame rate drops that I literally couldn't steer the car. I kept crashing in the game. The apps crashed, too. Games like Final Fantasy 7 simply wouldn't load. Other apps would open, hang, and die. There are some memory leak problems, too — which means that Android apps would go rogue and start taking up more RAM than they're supposed to, bogging the whole system down. I also ran into performance issues with a key new feature of the Chromebook Pro: the stylus. The input lag borders on unacceptable. It's not just that opening up the main app designed for stylus input — Google Keep — is an invitation to take a break and get a cup of coffee. It's that when you start writing or drawing, the digital ink can sometimes be as much as a second behind where your stylus is on the screen. Stylus input should be measured in milliseconds. Google is working on this, too, and will release a version that uses machine learning to mitigate that lag by predicting which pixels are getting drawn on the fly. The problems go beyond performance, though. There's also the user interface. Right now, Android apps can't be resized like other windows. They can only be displayed in one of a few different sizes: full screen, phone size, or tablet size. Switching between them is kind of a hassle, and I would spend agonizing seconds watching each app reposition and reorient itself. The reason behind the weird window size thing is that this beta is running the last version of Android, Marshmallow. Google is working furiously to get the latest version of Android, Nougat, running on Chrome OS. When it does, you'll be able to resize windows to whatever size you want — provided developers have updated their apps to support it. Once Nougat arrives, both Android apps and Chrome OS itself will be able to pull off tricks they can't now. The clearest example is tablet mode. Right now, when you flip the screen around every window automatically goes full screen. There's no way to put things in windows or into split screen. There's also a bug where Chrome windows don't remember where they're supposed to be on the screen when you reopen them after closing them. Will Android apps ever be good on big screens? I'd like to tell you that everything will be hunky-dory once Nougat arrives, but the problem goes much deeper than that. The real problem is that the thing we've been complaining about with Android apps on big screens for literally five years now is still a huge problem. Most Android apps — including many apps that are made by Google itself — look absolutely atrocious on a large screen. Again, Google is promising that this problem will be mitigated or fixed with Nougat, because there will be more tools for developers to resize their apps and because Google is making a big push to get them to do so. I'd like to believe Google on this, but I'm also five years into hearing these kinds of promises without results. Perhaps Chrome OS with Android will be popular enough to entice developers into doing it. But I’m not confident it will be. Last but certainly not least, Android apps were designed for a phone world, where resources are scant. There are a few standout apps that feel a little more desktop class than others (specifically, Microsoft's Office suite and a few of Adobe's newer apps), but most of them feel and act like what they are: phone apps on a laptop. If Google wants Chrome OS to take on cheap Windows laptops, it needs to do better. I spent an hour talking with the engineers behind Chrome OS about every single one of these and plenty of other issues. In every single case, they told me they were aware of them and actively working on them. I believe them, and because the Chromebook Pro isn't getting released until April, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this will all be resolved upon release. I'll give the Chromebook Pro a proper review then, so again, don't take this cavalcade of complaints as a indicative of what consumers will experience. What you should take away from this experience is that it's not always a great idea to put beta software on the devices you use and depend on every day. Also: that the merging of mobile apps and true desktop web apps may sound wonderful and maybe even inevitable, but, for lack of a better phrase, it’s complicated. I like cookie dough, but it can make you sick. Usually, it's better to wait until everything is fully baked.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's latest Xeon chips based on Skylake due next year AMD sets Ryzen up for a strong start as chip battle with Intel looms Qualcomm's new chip may be too late as ARM server market fades Video Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on No Intel chip has ever been as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The $8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. [ From Docker containers and Nano Server to software-defined storage and networking improvements, Windows Server 2016 is packed with great additions: Get the scoop on Windows Server 2016 from InfoWorld. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter. ] The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-10 14:00:00 UTC Mashable Choice highlights the best of everything we cover, have experienced first-hand and would recommend to others. What's the easiest way to make an existing gadget new and refreshing? Just add a stylus. At least that seems to be the trend these days. Samsung's new Chromebook Plus and Pro are the latest computers to embrace the digital pen.  Priced at $449 and $549, respectively, Samsung's 2-in-1 Chromebooks cost more than your average Chromebook, but also offer far more utility. SEE ALSO: Samsung's new 2-in-1 Chromebooks now include a stylus I've been trying out the Chromebook Pro, which comes out in April, for the last few weeks and it's really incredible to see how far Chromebooks have come since their original launch so many moons ago. The Chromebook Pro has proven to be more than enough to replace my 13-inch MacBook Air — and that's mostly because of access to Android apps via the Google Play Store. But before we jump into that, let's talk about the hardware, because for $550, it's lovely and not at all cheap-looking or feeling (at least to me). Image: lili sams/mashable The aluminum body is as sturdy as it gets and doesn't flex the way so many plastic Chromebooks do. It's a handsome Chromebook, for sure. The 12.3-inch touchscreen flips a full 360 degrees and transforms into a tablet, and works in various modes in-between (i.e. "stand" and "tent"). Like Samsung's flagship mobile phones, the bright Super AMOLED display on the Chromebook Pro is just stunning with 2,400 x 1,600 resolution and vibrant colors that pop and make you want to reach out and just touch images. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE At least on paper, the Chromebook Pro is nearly on par with Apple's MacBook. It's got an Intel Core m3 processor and Intel HD Graphics 515. The Core m3 isn't the most powerful processor in Intel's arsenal, but for the Chromebook Pro it's more than enough to juggle a dozen tabs without slow to a crawl. The Chromebook Pro comes with 4GB of RAM, which is half as much as the MacBook, but since you're basically spending most of your time in Chrome and not running desktop-grade apps like Final Cut Pro X that tax the hardware, it's plenty.  Like on most Chromebooks, storage is pretty limited. The laptop comes with 32GB of internal storage, but you can expand that via the microSD card slot. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Samsung says the Chromebook Pro's battery lasts up to 10 hours, but the reality is more like anywhere between 6-8 hours of mixed usage (Chrome, music streaming in the background, watching YouTube videos).  As for ports, the Chromebook Pro has two USB-C ports, so you can charge and plug in an accessory, and a headphone jack.  Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE There are two key features that any good laptop needs to get right: the keyboard and trackpad.  Typing on the island-style keys feels mostly good with really comfortable, bouncy travel on each key, but my biggest complaint is the keyboard isn't quite full-sized, which means some of the keys like backspace, tab, and enter are a little smaller than the others and the entire typing experience feels a little cramped. It's a minor quibble that is annoying, but not a total deal breaker by any means. The trackpad, however, is superb. It's not as large as on some laptops like the 12-inch MacBook, but who cares: it's super smooth and responsive. I've said it many times before and I'll say it again: It's embarrassing that Chromebooks have better trackpads than so many Windows laptops.  Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Of course, the marquee feature, the stylus, is probably the reason why you're here.  Is it any good? The short answer is yes. The long answer is: Only if you don't expect Surface Pen or Apple Pencil-level pinpoint accuracy and pressure sensitivity.  Serious artists may not be as impressed, but casual doodlers will like it a lot, especially how it integrates with software. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE As soon as you pull out the stylus, a menu of tools pops up on the screen. You could use the stylus to capture a region of the screen, capture the entire screen, make a new note, switch on a magnifying glass to enlarge parts of the screen, or turn on the laser pointer mode. Notes and doodles are all stored in Google Keep. But the coolest part is that Keep has advanced hand-writing recognition so you can search hand-written notes. It's really impressive when it works, but can sometimes be a miss (like for recognizing cursive). Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Perhaps even more exciting than the stylus is support for Android apps via the Google Play store.  One of the main complaints about Chromebooks is that they're limited to web apps. For some people, Google's suite of services (Docs, Gmail, Maps, etc.) is all they need. But others, like myself, want and need more. Android apps on Chromebooks completely changes the game and gives these predominately cloud-based laptops access to the same app ecosystem on Android phones and tablets. Whether you need apps like Snapseed or Lightroom to edit images or just want to play some games, the Chromebook Pro can handle them. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Most Android apps work just like they do on Android, but your experience will vary depending on the app because not all of them are optimized with for keyboard and mouse. For instance, some apps like Slack appear to work well with mouse and keyboard, until you realize you can't send messages by pressing the "enter" key and have to lift your hand up to tap the send (paper airplane) button on the screen. The version of Google Play and Android apps I tested was still in beta, so things will definitely change come April, but even with some of the bugs, it looks very promising. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Chromebooks are great and fit the needs for many people these days, but the one thing I keep hearing over and over is that they wish their Chromebooks did more. While it's still not quite the equal to a Mac or Windows laptop, the Samsung Chromebook Pro offers more than any previous Chromebook before and lays the foundation for other Chromebooks to follow suit this year. If the Chromebook Pro is any indication, 2017 is the year Chromebooks really grow up and blossom into computers we can all take more seriously. Samsung Chromebook Pro The Good Sharp, bright screen • Handy, responsive built-in stylus • Excellent trackpad and touchscreen The Bad Stylus isn't as sensitive as Apple Pencil • Slightly cramped keyboard The Bottom Line With a stylus, Samsung's Chromebook Pro gives Chromebooks a much-needed creative boost.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop By Joel Hruska on February 10, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel announced that it had created a new type of non-volatile memory in partnership with Micron, dubbed 3D XPoint, there have been questions about how the new memory would perform and what kind of systems might ship it in the future. The ostensible draw of alternative memory technologies like 3D XPoint (Intel markets its drives under the Optane brand) is that it can offer non-volatile storage performance at speeds more comparable to DRAM, but with better power consumption. Discussions on cost are less certain — right now, Intel and Micron are focused on introducing the technology and it’ll be fairly expensive for the near-term future. Long-term price is an unknown — the sheer economy of scale around NAND flash makes it difficult for any new storage technology to challenge in terms of cost-per-GB. Now, however, we have some idea how Optane will perform, at least in Intel’s initial data center SSD. Intel’s P4800X series is a 375GB drive with sequential read/write speeds of 2400MB/s and 2000MB/s respectively. Random 4KB IOPS are rated at 550K/s for reads and 500K/s for writes. Overclockers3D points out that this compares extremely favorably with Samsung’s 960 Pro SSD, which offers up to 330K IOPS for random 4KB reads and writes. Still, it’s worth bearing in mind that IOPS are substantially meaningless without a great deal of information about how the tests were conducted and how the workloads were designed. On their own, they don’t tell us much. One thing we do know, however, is that Optane can deliver excellent performance even with a queue depth of 1. Queue depth refers the number of commands that can be queued within a storage controller at the same time. A queue depth of 32 is commonly used when testing desktop applications and software, and as you can see, a queue depth of 1 produces poor performance on an SSD. Queue depth of 1 on the left, 32 on the right. CrystalDiskMark is a simple test, but it illustrates this issue well enough. The graph above is from my own system, using a spare SSD I’ve got installed. At a queue depth of 32, the SSD is 7.82x faster than with a queue depth of 1 in 4K random reads. The gap between write speed is less dramatic, but QD=32 is still 2.23x faster than QD=1. Typically, storage workloads stack up large queue depths and high-end hardware controllers can handle far more than the 32 queues specified in SATA — but if Optane can deliver excellent performance at low queue depths as well as high, it could prove a potent competitor in any workload dominated by such metrics. These are the first Optane drives, and they’re intended for data centers, not consumers. Intel does have plans to make Kaby Lake accelerators available to customers with a Z270 chipset, but pricing and availability have not been announced. Now read: How do SSDs work?

According to reports in the media, Apple leaked the hardware specifications through its MacOS 10.12.4 public beta. The OS further hints at products that haven’t been released yet indicating that Apple could be having a new range of devices up its sleeves and could reveal them this year. According to Forbes report, Apple is working on its MacOS to accommodate the MacBook Pro’s update to Intel’s seventh generation chipset “Kaby Lake.” Intel has already started manufacturing these chips in large numbers and there is a strong possibility that Microsoft too is going to use these processors for its Surface Pro 5. Because MacBook Pro 2016 was released at a time when Intel was still working on Kaby Lake, Apple was forced to use Intel’s sixth generation chipset. However, with Intel now already mass producing Kaby Lake processors, MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to use them. For those who already own a MacBook Pro 2016, they wouldn’t really find a whole lot of difference in the MacBook Pro 2017 performance as Kaby Lake is only a minor upgrade of Sky lake. Beyond the slight performance improvement, we expect MacBook Pro 2017 to feature improved internal graphics as well as longer battery life and support for 4K displays. Overall, MacBook Pro lineup of Skylake processor will now be replaced Kaby Lake. The i5 6360U will be replaced by i5 7260U, the i5 6267U by the i5 7267U, the i7 6700HQ by the i7 7700HQ, and so on. You can check the complete details at Pike’s Universum. We expect MacBook Pro 2017 to be released later this year – sometime around Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference.

AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Apple, Google, Uber Fight Travel Ban Next Article > Verizon, T-Mobile Tie for Best Network, OpenSignal Report Finds By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 Across the U.S., Verizon and T-Mobile are practically neck and neck in terms of mobile network speeds and performance, according to the latest findings from OpenSignal's crowdsourced monitoring. OpenSignal also found that 4G speeds continue to rise, with typical speeds in many cities surpassing the national average. Of 36 cities the company studied from October through December, 25 now have one or more mobile service providers that deliver average LTE speeds faster than 20 Mbps (megabits per second). The city with the fastest 4G speeds in the new study is Detroit, where both Verizon and T-Mobile average LTE download speeds of more than 25 Mbps. Minneapolis and Chicago also have at least one operator with average 4G speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. OpenSignal's results are based on some 4.6 billion crowdsourced datapoints measured through its mobile app, which is being used by nearly 170,000 people across the U.S. Verizon Retains Top 4G Availability -- for Now Compared to the results in its previous "State of Mobile Networks" report, released in August, OpenSignal found that Verizon had gained some ground over T-Mobile in its 4G speed rankings late last year. "Verizon has clearly taken exception to T-Mobile's recent attempts to steal the network spotlight," the new report noted. "Verizon is fighting back with 4G upgrades of its own, and as our latest results in the U.S. show it's doing so quite effectively. The two are again tied in network speeds in our tests, but T-Mobile continues to chip away at Verizon's vaunted lead in 4G availability." Tests showed that Verizon currently offers the highest 4G availability rates, with those speeds available 88.2 percent of the time. T-Mobile, however, is only two percentage points behind, "the closest we've seen that difference," OpenSignal said. T-Mobile: 'We're Pushing Industry' Overall, all four of the nation's top wireless carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, realized "significant improvements in their 4G availability scores" over the past six months, according to OpenSignal. While Sprint remains in fourth place in terms of availability, it has improved its performance by nearly seven percentage points during that time, the OpenSignal report noted. The latest report also finds that a growing number of cities across the U.S. have access to faster 4G speeds: 25 now have access to LTE speeds of 20 Mbps or better, compared to the 18 identified in August's report. "Verizon recently began upgrading its networks with LTE-Advanced technology, which definitely explains some of the big jumps in Verizon's speed we’ve seen in the last six months in cities like New York and Orlando," OpenSignal analyst Kevin Fitchard noted in a blog post yesterday. "But we see speeds improvements from other operators as well as the industry goes through the methodical process of tweaking LTE performance across the country. For instance, AT&T and T-Mobile have been deploying LTE in new frequency bands and in many cases are using old spectrum they no longer need for 2G or 3G services." In a statement released yesterday, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said the new OpenSignal report shows that his company's LTE network-building efforts have "pushed the industry to try to catch up."

AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Russian Hackers Get Burned in Deal Next Article > Salesforce Ties Its CRM into Quip Productivity Suite By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 CRM giant Salesforce introduced several new features to its Quip productivity platform this week, including a new way to import CRM (customer relationship management) data directly into Quip documents and spreadsheets. The changes will help increase productivity and allow users to collaborate with each other more easily, according to Salesforce. "Quip is extending the power of Salesforce with a sleek, next-generation productivity solution designed for teams -- empowering everyone across an organization with the tools they need to collaborate more effectively, work smarter and supercharge their productivity,”" the company said in a statement. The Hyper-Connected Workplace Salesforce said Quip's new features come in response to the hyper-connected nature of the modern workplace, in which employees are forced to sort through disconnected email threads, to-do lists and applications to gather information they need while the work itself happens somewhere else. "According to IDC, knowledge workers spend 61 percent of their workweek answering email, searching for information and communicating internally," Salesforce said. "Additionally, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates companies can raise, through new technologies, the productivity of knowledge workers by up to 25 percent." To help achieve those numbers, the company introduced several new features to the Quip platform, including new integrations for Salesforce users, a new checklist and an improved user experience. Importing Salesforce Data into Quip The live data feature allows users to import CRM data from Salesforce, such as account values and service cases, to Quip documents. Once in Quip, the information automatically syncs with Salesforce. For example, with a single export, sales reps can generate forecasting spreadsheets that will be updated with the most recent Salesforce data, the company said. The Quip Lightning component, meanwhile, enables teams to link, access and create Quip documents, spreadsheets and task lists directly from within Salesforce. This allows users to find and collaborate on documents within the context of their businesses. For example, a sales rep will be able to quickly create a task list within an opportunity record to ensure the team is aligned on the final steps necessary to close the deal. With Quip checklists users can manage projects inside Quip with tasks that go beyond owners and due dates. Quip users can enhance everyday workflows by adding reminders to anything, from spreadsheet rows that need to be updated to drafts waiting for review. In addition, an all new sidebar environment and contextual menus include new document, spreadsheet and checklist tools that can adapt to the work users are doing. "We're proud to debut a new, smarter Quip that anticipates a team's needs like never before," said Bret Taylor, CEO of Quip, a Salesforce company, in the statement. "By bringing the power of dynamic business data into living documents, we'e introducing the next generation of team productivity and collaboration." Quip's new user experience and Quip checklists are already available for all Quip users at no extra cost. Quip Connect, including the live data feature and the Quip Lightning component, will be available for users of Quip Enterprise and Salesforce on the AppExchange later this month.

Trying Intel Kabylake Graphics With Civilization VI On Ubuntu Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 10 February 2017 at 06:30 AM EST. 1 Comment I was very surprised to find out that I was able to get Intel HD Graphics working with Aspyr Media's latest Linux game port, Civilization VI. Here are some benchmark results. Aspyr Media only lists NVIDIA graphics as officially supported, but I couldn't resist trying out the latest-generation Intel Kabylake graphics for this game. Yesterday I posted 14-way NVIDIA benchmarks of Civilization 6 on Linux while my RadeonSI results are coming up shortly... Using Mesa 17.1-dev + Linux 4.10 on an Ubuntu 16.10 box with Core i7 7700K HD Graphics 630, I was shocked that Civilization VI started up right away and appeared to be rendering correctly... The benchmark mode also worked. At least for the benchmark mode, the rendering appeared correct, so I ran a few benchmarks to see. Even with the lowest quality settings at a mere resolution of 1024 x 768, the Core i7 7700K system couldn't top 30 FPS. With higher quality settings? Not above 10 FPS. When pushing the i7-7700K Kabylake box with Linux 4.10 + Mesa 17.1 to 1080p, the frame-rate dropped from 26 to 21 FPS. Keep in mind that Civilization 6's benchmark mode is on the heavier side compared to actual gameplay. So while it was a surprise Intel Kabylake graphics on Mesa Git were rendering the game correctly, the performance is very, very slow. In actual gameplay it would probably be too choppy to be playable even with the lowest quality settings, but maybe when Kabylake Iris Graphics roll-out there will be more possibilities for Intel Linux gaming. Our NVIDIA results also show how heavy of a port Civ 6 is with its OpenGL implementation. The RadeonSI numbers for this game up next. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

MSI’s updated GS63VR makes a big leap up the gaming laptop food chain. MSI’s updated GS63VR makes a big leap up the gaming laptop food chain. Highs Solid CPU performance Handles games beautifully at 1080p Plenty of connectivity Display offers solid contrast ratio Lows Packed with bloatware Display’s gamma is inaccurate DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro gaming laptop review By Brad Bourque Posted on 02.06.17 (updated on 02.08.17) Research Center: MSI GS63VR 6RF Stealth Pro You’ve likely come across MSI’s GS60 if you’ve shopped for gaming laptops in the last ten years. Despite minor changes each year, the look remains the same — a thin, black chassis with a colorful Steelseries keyboard and whatever Nvidia discrete graphics option is trendy. But this time felt a little different. Intel’s mobile CPU offerings are more power efficient than ever, and Nvidia’s mobile line performs very similarly to the desktop chips. That could mean a bigger leap forward than normal for this year’s edition, which is just under seven tenths of an inch thick. More: Acer Predator 15 review To that end, MSI has picked the Intel Core i7-6700HQ, paired up with 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1060 for gaming. For storage, you’ll find a 256GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and a 1080p screen, with a $1,700 MSRP that often falls closer to $1,550. Is this the year the GS60 finally rises from evergreen option to true competitor? A fuzzy bottom MSI’s GS63VR might look familiar. If it does, it’s because MSI builds these enclosures in-house, and then licenses them out to other manufacturers for rebranding. It’s a bland affair, but the bright side is a lower chassis that feels sturdy and svelte, whether tucked under your arm or out in a meeting. Turn off the RGB keys, and no one would guess you’re using a gaming laptop. The screen is a different story. It’s slightly flimsy, bending and curving a bit when you open or close the lid. MSI’s logo at the center of the screen on the bottom bezel is even worse, flexing dramatically at the slightest touch. It’s not an uncommon problem for smaller systems, although most higher-end models avoid it. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Strangely, the MSI has a fuzzy bottom – no joke! The underside is coated in a thin fabric. This is a design choice we’re not clear on. Theoretically, this helps keep any heat from radiating as badly into the user’s lap. It never seemed to get too hot around the bottom, so if that was the goal, it works as intended. It also keeps an otherwise slick laptop from sliding around on a desktop much, although most systems accomplish the same without getting warm-and-fuzzy. Rich set of plugs What the MSI lacks in looks, it makes up for with a healthy number of wired connections. Up the left side, you’ll find 3.5mm audio in and out, a full-sized SD card slot, Ethernet, and three USB 3.0 ports. Around the right side, there’s a full-sized HDMI port, Mini DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, and an extra USB 2.0 for good measure. That’s a lot of connection options for such a slim machine, even among other gaming systems. Full-sized video outputs are always appreciated, particularly the inclusion of HDMI 2.0, for 60Hz 4K. That’s an option the best gaming monitors are frequently supporting. A familiar keyboard Like the system’s design, the MSI’s SteelSeries keyboard is one we’re very familiar with. It packs in a numpad, an increasingly uncommon feature on 15-inch laptops. It’s a bit narrow, a problem that expands to the whole keyboard. Thankfully, important buttons like “backspace” and both shifts are full-width, a blessing for gamers. Though bland, the chassis feels sturdy and svelte. Gaming laptops are typically fitted with comfortable, responsive keyboards, and what the MSI lacks in spaciousness, it makes up for with chunky switches that have a clear activation point and solid movement. They’re bolstered by full, bright back-lighting in RGB zones, allowing you to customize the look to your liking. The touchpad isn’t as exciting. The integrated buttons are a bit mushy, and there isn’t a clear indicator between the left and right click areas. It’s spacious, but not as wide or tall as some of the massive touchpads we’ve grown used to seeing in more expensive laptops. Deep contrast, hurt by gamma The MSI’s 15-inch, 1080p panel is the baseline resolution for gaming systems these days. More and more, high-end systems have reached for 1440p or 4K panels — unfortunately, mobile gaming hardware can’t always keep up with the latest games at native resolution. We have no problem with the MSI chosen here, and feel it’s a good match with the GTX 1060 graphics chip. While the GS63VR’s display isn’t impressive, it scores well enough across the board. Its maximum brightness and contrast are both right at acceptable levels, without really excelling in either category, particularly when faced off against recent OLED panels that have made their way into systems like the Alienware 13. Color gamut is average, so nothing to complain about there. The gamma is too low, resulting in slightly washed-out images, and color accuracy is off, but that’s not likely to matter too much. The result is a panel that fits all the needs of the gamer on the go. Contrast is one of the most important aspects when it comes to gaming, allowing for deep, dark blacks and brighter explosions and light sources. In that sense, the MSI’s display performs well, but you’ll typically have to tweak the in-game gamma to get the most out of it. Once you do, you’ll find a pleasantly deep image, even if it doesn’t keep up with newer OLED panels in terms of black levels. MSI GS63VR 6RF Stealth Pro Compared To Alienware 13 R3 Acer Predator 15 AVADirect Avant P750DM2-G Razer Blade (2016) MSI GS60 Ghost Pro Acer Predator 17 G9-791-79Y3 Alienware 15 (2015) Asus ROG G501 Digital Storm Triton Acer Aspire V15 Nitro Edition Alienware 17 AVADirect Clevo P157SM-A MSI Global GT60 Dominator Pro Lenovo IdeaPad Y500 Origin Eon 17-S Movies are less appealing, simply because there isn’t always an easy way to adjust the gamma back to standard levels. As such, you may find that darker scenes in media look overexposed, and washed out.  On the bright side, VLC allows easy adjustment for video files, making off-kilter gamma an easily solvable problem. Louder isn’t always better If there’s one thing the MSI’s speakers do well, it’s volume. They are loud. Yet turning the volume up all the way, even while playing music, is ill-advised, as the tone becomes a serious issue. Even at half volume, the GS63VR’s speakers crack and sputter, and bass is non-existent. Granted, most gaming laptop users are going to bring a pair of headphones, and audio quality is a sore spot for slimmer laptops. But the MSI performs worse than most. We’ve seen this chip before Our review unit was equipped with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, the most common quad-core chip for laptops. It’s a familiar chip to us, as we’ve tested it in multiple systems over the last year. We didn’t expect any surprises. Apart from the AVADirect Avant’s desktop-grade CPU claiming several victories, the MSI’s Core i7-6700HQ is one of the stronger options we’ve seen in a gaming laptop so far. It claims victories over both the Acer Predator 15, and Surface Book with Performance Base. We have more systems to compare in our older Handbrake 4K video conversion test, and the MSI keeps up there too. It even beats out the desktop-grade AVADirect Avant’s CPU, at least in some of our test situations. More: Razer Blade (2016) review Of course, CPU isn’t the only thing that matters when it comes to gaming. Everything from the solid state drive to the graphics chip can make a huge difference in framerate and gaming quality. Life in the fast lane Our review unit came packed with two hard drives. The boot drive was a 256GB Samsung SM951 — a common PCIe SSD — with a 1TB data drive for some extra games or media. The NVMe SSD in the MSI screamed past the competition in terms of read speed. Not surprising, considering the only other comparable system we’ve tested with a PCIe SSD is the Razer Blade. Even in terms of write speed, where mid-tier NVMe drives tend to fall behind, the GS63VR’s offering holds a strong lead. It might not feel a lot faster than a SATA SSD moment to moment, but it makes a big difference in both longevity and SSD-intensive tasks. GPU test track This time around, the GS63VR is powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, the equivalent of last generation’s GTX 970M. It’s a powerful mobile chip, and one that should be more than capable of handling modern games at the system’s native 1080p resolution. The GS63VR trades blows with its closest competitor, the Acer Predator 15, in the synthetic 3DMark graphical tests. Both systems are remarkably similar, so it’s no real surprise that the difference between the two is never more than three percent. The AVADirect Avant’s GTX 1070 steals a win over both laptops, partially thanks to its full-power desktop Core i5, but mostly it’s the higher-end GPU that deserves credit. On the open road We’ve tested the GTX 1060 in several situations, and out on the open road, it handles 1080p gaming without breaking a sweat, and can even stay competitive when the resolution goes up. The MSI’s 75 frame per second average in Battlefield 1, with the settings cranked up, is a strong start, and the score is exactly where we’d like to see it. It should be more than capable of holding the 60FPS ideal spot. While the average framerate in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided might not look so sharp, it’s a very demanding game, and the MSI’s score is reasonably average. With a little tuning in the settings, you should have no issue pushing the game to 60 FPS or higher, which is all you can really ask from a slim gaming laptop. More: Alienware 13 R3 review All in all, the MSI’s performance in-game isn’t going to set any records. But it’s more than enough for gamers looking to take their evening of Overwatch into the living room, and it should be able to keep up at 1080p for at least a few years. Thin without sacrificing battery life There are two aspects to portability — size and battery life. In the former, the MSI excels, with a slim footprint and an efficient use of space that allows for a full-sized numpad and trackpad. At just under .7 inches thick, the GS63VR has a waistline.02 mm thinner than the Razer Blade. It feels great. Typically, a slim chassis means less room for batteries, and you trade backpack space for longevity. The MSI packs in a surprisingly mid-range 54Wh battery. Yet it manages to hit almost five hours in our video loop, which is good news for travelers and movie lovers. The MSI also manages to power through just over three hours of the Peacekeeper browser benchmark before collapsing from exhaustion, a score that either ties its competitors, or beats them by up to an hour. It doesn’t quite keep up with non-gaming systems, but among laptops with discrete graphics, it holds its own well. So very bloated While other high-end system manufacturers have worked hard to cut back on unnecessary bundled software, MSI has embraced the bloatware life with a swath of intrusive software of dubious utility. In fact, there was so much extra software on our review unit that the first thing we did was run a fresh installation of Windows 10, as we were having compatibility issues with our benchmarking software. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends It’s not a rare problem for gaming laptops, which often pack in extra software and optimization utilities. To have them be so bad that you need to reinstall the OS is another issue entirely. The upshot is that it’s an easy fix that doesn’t take very long. If the idea of installing your own OS is a completely foreign one, it’s worth noting you might struggle with the MSI right out of the box. Warranty MSI provides a one year warranty on all of its laptops. That’s fairly standard for laptops of any category, and right in line with the MSI’s competitors. As an added bonus, MSI also covers damage because of “drops, spills, electrical surges, or fire” and will repair or replace the system once within the first year. All you have to cover is shipping back to MSI. Our Take MSI’s GS63VR packs familiar components into a plain chassis, but that doesn’t mean it’s boring or useless. In fact, MSI manages to provide competitive gaming performance, paired up with a decent 1080p panel, in one of the slimmest designs we’ve yet to see from a gaming notebook. Is there a better alternative? While the gaming laptop world grows more crowded every day, the MSI GS63VR is now one of the slimmest on the market. If you don’t plan on using a gaming laptop as your daily driver, the AVADirect Avant or the Asus ROG G752 bulk up a bit, but offer better performance options. The DT Accessory Pack Razer DeathAdder Chroma gaming mouse $50 Sennheiser PC 373D - 7.1 surround sound gaming headset $249 Razer BlackWidow Chroma Clicky mechanical gaming keyboard $125 If backpack space is at a minimum, or you need to fly under the radar with your gaming, the Razer Blade is an option. Origin also offers almost the exact same chassis with its EVO-15, but expect to pay a couple hundred dollars more for it. Paying more for the Origin does net you better customer support, and provides additional customization options. How long will it last? With the latest generation Nvidia graphics and a PCIe SSD, now is a good time to pick up the MSI GS63VR in terms of longevity. The only knock against it is the 6th-generation Intel hardware, but MSI announced at CES 2017 that the GS63VR will move to the 7th-gen soon– so wait if that concerns you. The 1080p screen is limiting in some ways, but also ensures you have enough overhead to keep playing the latest games at native resolution for a few years. Should you buy it? Yes. This MSI doesn’t turn heads like an Alienware, but it’s perfect for weekend warriors looking to keep a low profile, while still churning out smooth performance in modern games. Plus, it’s well-priced, with a $1,700 MSRP that often falls under $1,600 fully tricked out, without making any major compromises, apart from needing to uninstall a bunch of bloatware. Previous models of the GS60 didn’t impress us, but this new version is a huge step in the right direction.

So what's next? According to Valve chief Gabe Newell, the future of VR is all power: lighter, more capable headsets that are hooked up to PCs much more powerful than what most people own right now. "VR is going to drive much higher computational and GPU loads than we see out of existing desktop games," Newell said recently.  "Like, I would argue that the smartest thing AMD and Intel and Nvidia could do is give away VR development systems to software developers, because we're going to consume the shit out of Intel and AMD CPUs! Much more so than high-end games are doing right now." Plus, he's confident that PC-powered room-scale VR will progress to "house-scale" VR in the near future, as it becomes possible to knit several "room-scale" VR spaces together into a single space. Of course, you'd need room-scale-capable wireless VR headsets too, but Newell believes they're a "solved problem" that are right around the corner. "My expectation is that [wireless] will be an add-on in 2017, and then it will be an integrated feature in 2018," said Newell, speaking during a recent press briefing attended by Gamasutra and other outlets. The conversations that ensued saw Newell and fellow staffers opening up a bit about the state of the company's VR hardware and software development efforts. More notably, for devs who are making VR games and want to continue making VR games for the foreseeable future, they spoke a bit about where they see the VR market going in the next few years -- and what steps the company is taking to try and nudge it forward. As we reported yesterday, Newell says Valve is currently developing three new "full" VR games, using both its own Source 2 engine and Unity. These are games Valve expects to charge for, games the company hopes will attract a lot of attention. Designing VR games with "mass appeal" "We're definitely trying to build stuff with mass appeal," Newell says, as opposed to the sort of prototypes and experiments (like The Lab) that have dominated Valve's VR software output to date. According to Newell, the folks at Valve have learned enough about VR development that they're willing to start making some bigger bets.   "We're pretty sure that all the game developers are going to learn positive or negative lessons from what we do, which is sort of where we think we need to be." "We have this theory: we think we can make three big games, we think that we know enough now to do that, and we're going to find out if that's the case. We're pretty sure that all the game developers are going to learn positive or negative lessons from what we do, which is sort of where we think we need to be," he said. "There will be really clear design choices that we're making, in each of these games. They're very different. Each game developer will be able to look at those and say, that was great, that was not as great. Which is part of, from our point of view, that's a useful charateristic of these three." Pushing VR game design forward is important to the folks at Valve because, according to Newell, there are some great VR experiences out there -- but not enough to justify millions of people buying PC-driven headsets. In Valve's eyes it's quality/quantity of available software, rather than price of entry, that's keeping a lot of people from buying into the VR market. "If you took the existing [PC-driven] VR systems and made them 80 percent cheaper, there's still not a huge market. There's still not a really incredibly compelling reason for people to spend 20 hours a day in VR," said Newell. "We actually think that if anything, most of the interesting stuff is going to be happening on the high end. That we're actually resolution-constrained, we're CPU-constrained, we're GPU-constrained. That's where the interesting stuff is gonna happen, not on the low end of the market. Once you've got it, once you've got something and you can say okay, this is the thing that causes millions of people to be excited about it, then you start worrying about cost-reducing."  "There's sort of an old joke that premature cost reduction is the root of all evil," he added. Building better VR hardware, informed by the needs of VR game makers Valve is also working to improve its VR hardware in conjunction with its VR game development efforts, a symbiotic arrangement that Newell likens to the way Nintendo handles game and hardware design. "One of the questions you might ask us, why in the world are we making hardware?" Newell said. "What we can do now is we can be designing hardware at the same time that we're designing software. This is something that Miyamoto has always had, right. He's had the ability to think about what input devices and the design of systems should be like, while he's trying to design games. And our sense is that that's going to allow us to actually build much better entertainment experiences for people." This has been the goal from the start, according to Newell. When it comes to the business of building VR hardware, Valve sees it as a valuable complement to its games and services businesses, rather than as an end in itself. "The idea isn't oh, we've suddenly thought we could make more money by building hardware," said Newell. "Hardware's actually traditionally been kind of a lousy, low-margin business. But in order to take what we think are interesting steps forward in terms of the kinds of experiences we design, we need the ability to be thinking more about everything the customer is doing." So how has that actually worked out, now that Valve has had Vive hardware on store shelves for nearly a year -- and been experimenting internally for far longer?  According to Newell, devs can see an example of how this process pays off by looking at the mockups of Valve's new VR controllers, which surfaced at Steam Dev Days last year and are far more akin to Oculus' Touch controllers than the wand controllers which come with the HTC Vive.  A (poor) snapshot of a prototype of Valve's new VR controller, which is meant to rest in the hand These new controllers "came from doing the first generation [of Vive controllers]; working on our games, people working on the games were like 'here's stuff we would actually use.' And then they'll mock it up, we'll do a hardware prototype, they'll go back and change the game. The process is iterative," said Newell. "And I think we have our own internal development process, and then we take it out to our development partners, other game developers, and say 'so this is what our thinking is.' So Robin Walker will sit down and say, 'this is why we think this is important for what we're developing. And this is how we express that in terms of the next generation of hardware design.' Then we ask other people, 'does that match what you're thinking, or not?' And we get feedback from that." This iterative process of making VR games, designing VR hardware around those projects, then taking it outside the company for feedback, seems to drum up a lot of excitement among Newell and his colleagues. It feels a bit like the way Oculus execs were talking about "hand presence" (via their Oculus Touch controllers, naturally) back in 2015 -- there's this sense of anticipation, like game makers will soon have a whole new, mature and multi-faceted method of input to explore, one distinct from gamepads, keyboards, and mice. "It feels like we've been stuck with mouse and keyboard for a really long time," Newell said. "And the opportunity to build much more interesting kinds of experiences for players were there; we just needed to sort of expand what we can do. But [for us] it's not about being in hardware. It's about building better games. About taking bigger leaps." Hoping VR is more like the DS than the Wii However, the folks at Valve are quick to point out that they may totally drop the ball -- that they are, in fact, trying to get comfortable with the notion that VR as a whole might still fail in spectacular fashion. Newell says he's optimistic about the future of VR, but admits he's been wrong before. "You can always be surprised, right. Like personally, I think the DS was kind of stupid, right? I was totally wrong. I thought Sony was going to crush Nintendo in that generation of handheld devices," said Newell. "I hadn't worked on it, I hadn't tried to design any games for it, and clearly the DS ended up being the winner. The flipside was, the first time I played Wii Sports -- just to continue using Nintendo as an example -- I was like oh my god, there's so much opportunity, there's so much potential here, that we're all going to go discover. And then it sort of turned out that Wii Sports pretty much nailed it. And that was it! Everything else just ended up....there was less sort of innovation, to mine, in that direction. So even when you're doing it, even when you have a really good instance where it seems like there's potential, you can still find out there isn't much there."   "Where we are today is way further down the road than we were a year ago, but it's just going to be this slow, kind of painful, fits and starts kind of thing." He went on to acknowledge that the VR market is still volatile, and it's yet unclear if/when it will see a significant expansion. We certainly saw the effects of that volatility last year, when some studios released VR games that became breakout successes -- Survios' Raw Data, Owlchemy Labs' Job Simulator, and Neat Corp.'s Budget Cuts spring to mind -- and many others released VR games that were "wildly unprofitable." "Yeah, the people who built VR, its sort of this trade-off," said Newell. "You say 'okay, how much risk am I taking on, and how much of an opportunity am I giving myself. How long is the runway gonna have to be before I really start to see explosive growth.' And each developer has to decide that." Going forward, Newell thinks most VR devs will continue to make VR games, the volatility of the market be damned. "I'm pretty sure there are almost no developers who are working on VR titles who are like saying 'Oh, I'm going to back off,'" he asserted. "They're all coming back and saying 'Oh, I'm gonna do more VR!'" However, he wants VR devs to appreciate and manage the risks that still plague the nascent VR game industry, and he reiterates that Valve is committed to working with developers to help them sort out funding concerns -- without any expectation of an exclusivity arrangement. "One conversation we have with some developers is around how they manage their risk, right. It's like you've got people building proprietary walled gardens who say be exclusive to us and we'll give you this bunch of money. And we're like, we hate exclusives. We think it's bad for everybody, certainly in the medium- to long-term, and I'd probably argue in the short-term as well," said Newell.  "But we're happy to say to people, look, you need to figure out how to manage your risk so you can develop the title you want to build. So let's have a conversation where we can help you manage your cashflow over the course of the development so you can go and build the thing you want. And get it out to market and start getting your money from where you should be, which is from your customers, rather than somebody else. We're perfectly willing to help people do that." "And then they say well, does that mean we have to be exclusive to Steam, or exclusive to the Vive, and we say oh hell no," he continued. "You guys should be making the best decisions for your customers, not having somebody else steer that. That's when we have conversations about that, it's usually around 'how do we pay the bills while we're building our next VR title.' And that's usually a pretty productive conversation. But it's really about smoothing out risk over the lifetime of VR investments." As we approach the one-year anniversary of the HTC Vive's debut, it's clear that Valve continues to view VR as less of a new platform (like, say, Steam Machines) and more of a new way of computing -- one that it's still intent on pushing forward.  The company is making a show of doubling down on VR game development, iterating on its VR hardware (devs should also expect an improved version of its Lighthouse tracking technology in the near future), and assuaging devs' fears about surviving and thriving in the fledgling VR market. "There's that little bit of tension between some people going out and saying oh there'll be millions of these, and we're like, wow....I don't think so," said Newell.  "Because I can't point to a single piece of content that would cause millions of people to justify changing their home computing at all. It's like a great thing for enthusiasts and hardcore people, and where we are today is way further down the road than we were a year ago, but it's just going to be this slow, kind of painful, fits and starts kind of thing."

Stock Jumped 13% Last Month What happened Shares of Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY) were surging last month, gaining 13% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . Image source: Mobileye. The self-driving car specialist benefited from a deal with BMW and Intel  in the beginning of the month and later jumped on an analyst upgrade. MBLY data by YCharts . So what Mobileye stock jumped out of the gate to start the new year, gaining 8% on Jan. 3 after announcing the deal with BMW and Intel. The three partners said they would put a fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of the year, and Mobileye is also planning with the car maker and tech company to bring autonomous vehicles to market by 2021. On the same day, the Israeli company announced a strategic partnership with NIO, an electric vehicle start-up. Later in the month, the stock continued to move higher as it got endorsements from several research firms and banks including Goldman Sachs , which lifted its rating on Mobileye to buy and gave it a $50 price target, saying the company was well positioned for upcoming opportunities in the autonomous driving space. Now what There’s no shortage of enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles on Wall Street. The consensus among tech companies, automakers, and others seems to be that at least partially autonomous vehicles will become commonplace within five to 10 years. However, for investors, Mobileye is one of the few pure-play stocks available. Shares of rival NVIDIA nearly tripled last year on growing possibilities in the industry. Mobileye’s partnerships across the spectrum of automakers seem encouraging, and the company is solidly profitable. No one knows for sure where autonomous vehicles are going, but Mobileye looks like a solid bet for investors itching for a piece of a potentially huge industry. 10 stocks we like better than Mobileye When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This will be the fourth consecutive year that Intel's main processor line will use 14nm technology. Intel are slowly progressing towards products built at 10nm, but it seems 10nm will not hit high-performance consumer parts first like in previous generations. Instead, Intel are focusing on data center parts "first for next process node", along with ultra-low-power consumer chips. While this news will disappoint PC hardware enthusiasts, the data center is a massive market and money-spinner for Intel, so it makes sense to focus their efforts there. According to Ashraf Eassa, who attended the Investor Day, Intel's VP and GM of Client and IoT, Dr. Venkata Renduchintala, said that process technology will be "fluid" based on the product segment. As such, it seems as though Intel's 8th-generation processor line will contain a mixture of architectures and nodes. It is currently believed the 8th-gen Core line will feature both Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake processors. Intel will use Cannon Lake, their 10nm die shrink of Kaby Lake, for ultra-low-power Y-series processors (Core M). Coffee Lake, the fourth line of 14nm processors with further process and architecture optimizations, will form the rest of the 8th-gen Core line-up from U-series ultraportable parts to S-series desktop parts. Intel expects 8th-generation processors to be upwards of 15 percent faster than Kaby Lake in some situations. Intel's 8th-generation line-up may end up being quite confusing, especially if a Kaby Lake U-series refresh is also included in the mix. Expect to hear more about Intel's plans closer to launch in the second half of 2017.

If the figures are accurate - and most sites believe them to be – it looks as if affordability will be one of the processors’ best features. Online store www.shopblt.com has leaked the prices of three Ryzen 7 Series SKUs - the Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X, and Ryzen 7 1700. All models come with 8 cores and 16 threads - the same as Intel’s $1049 Core i7-6900K. The Ryzen 7 1700, which has a TDP of 65 watts and boost clock speed of 3.7Ghz, costs just $317 - around 70 percent cheaper than Intel’s chip, which has the same clock speed and a TDP of 140W. The 3.4Ghz Base/3.8Ghz Boost Ryzen 7 1700X, meanwhile, has a TDP of 95 watts and costs $382. AMD’s flagship 3.6Ghz/4.0Ghz 1800X flagship chip costs $490. Shopblt has accurately listed the price of almost every AMD CPU before they were released, including the Athlon X4 845 and the Kaveri A10 7850K and A10 7700K, so these Ryzen prices are likely to be legit. Ryzen’s 5-series and 3-series CPUs will no doubt offer similar value for money and could make a dent Intel’s market dominance. In other Ryzen news, AMD has confirmed that its upcoming CPUs won’t be supported for Windows 7. Recent reports suggested that there would be Windows 7 drivers for Ryzen, but while AMD did test the processors on the older OS, there won’t be any support for what is still the most popular version of Windows. “To achieve the highest confidence in the performance of our AMD Ryzen desktop processors (formerly code-named ‘Summit Ridge’), AMD validated them across two different OS generations, Windows 7 and 10,” AMD told PCWorld. “However, only support and drivers for Windows 10 will be provided in AMD Ryzen desktop processor production parts.” Last year, Microsoft confirmed that Intel’s Kaby Lake would only be supported under Windows 10. Additionally, EE Times’ Rick Merritt reported that Ryzen CPUs would occupy less space and offer twice the amount of cache of Skylake chips. Even though both CPUs are build on a 14nm process, AMD's processors are about 10 percent smaller than Intel's and feature twice the L2 cache.

While we did not see a lot of extra performance on the IPC level when compared to Sky Lake, the additional core clock speed boosts when using the Kaby Lake Core i7 7700K clearly show an advantage. For the 200 Series launch, MSI has a plethora of motherboards that support Intel's 7th Generation Core series processor spread across a quartet of segments. First up, you have the Gaming Series that are targeted squarely at the enthusiast gaming segment. Here you would find any of the Gaming or Titanium branded motherboards. The Performance gaming segment is where you would find the Gaming Pro, Krait, and Carbon series boards. The Arsenal gaming segment has Military-themed board with names like Tomahawk, Mortar, and Bazooka. These boards feature beefed up heat sink packages, Military Class 5 components, and a wealth of Gaming-centric features. Last up is the Pro Series that the board I am looking at today belongs to. MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS is a board designed for max performance without all the flash you see on the Gaming series. Sporting features such as Twin Turbo M.2 slots, Click BIOS 5, Military Class 5 components, Steel Armor on the PCIe and DDR4 slots, VR Boost, Audio Boost 4, and so much more. Priced at $149 out the door, MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS offers up performance with an expansive feature set. Let's dig into what MSI has cooked up for its 200 Series products. MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Whereas the Gaming Series screams out from the shelves with bright red coloring, the Pro Series is more subdued in the approach using a silver and black theme to get its point across. The front panel shows the product name, compatibility with Intel's 7th Gen Core series processors, and a few of the hardware technologies utilized on the board, such as an Intel network solution, Turbo M.2, and Lightning USB. The back side of the box walks you a bit deeper into the feature set with mentions of the Audio Boost 4, DDR4 Boost, and Multi-GPU technologies, along with MSI's own Military Class 5 components. Inside the box, you see pretty standard fare with the board in an anti-static bag and the accessory bundle in the lower section of the container. The accessory bundle consists of an I/O panel, manual, quick start guide, driver and software disc, and a pair of SATA 6Gbps data cables. Slim, but it's enough to get you going.       Pulled out of the packages, the MSI Z270 SLI PLUS, visually, mirrors the theme of the packaging, with a deep black PCB with silver accents. Built for use with an Intel 7th Generation Core series processor and based on the Intel Z270 PCH, it brings a bunch of new feature sets to the table. Visually, the layout is what we have come to expect from "mainstream" level ATX form factor motherboards. As such, the main components, such as the PCH, LGA socket, DIMM slots, and expansion slots, are all in roughly the same locations. Nothing wrong with it, because the layout just works. On the back side of the PCB, there is not much of note, but on the right side of the PCB you can see the Mystic LED lit border that isolates the Audio Boost components from the rest of the circuitry on the PCB. This lets the Audio Boost 4 sound solution act as if it was indeed a discrete audio solution. Strategically placed LED's light up to present a halo effect around the PCB.     The I/O panel on MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS is covered with a decorative shroud that really cleans up the area when the board is mounted in a chassis. From the left you have a pair of USB 2.0 ports managed by the Z270 chipset, a dual purpose PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, a single DVI-D port supporting a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1200, a pair of ASMedia ASM 2142 managed USB 3.1 ports (one Type A and one Type C), and an HDMI port that supports resolutions up to 4K @ 24Hz. Surrounding the HDMI port are four USB 3.1 ports managed by the Z270 PCH. Two of those are designed to be used with the VR Boost software to optimize the interface for use with VR components. An Intel I219-V managed Gigabit LAN port features MSI's LAN protect solution to prevent current spikes of up to 15KV from damaging the system. Gold plated connections are used on the rear analog audio ports for MSI's Audio Boost 4 High Definition 7.1 sound solution. Expansion comes in the form of three 16x PCIe 3.0 slots that run at 16x/0x/4x or 8x/8x/4x, along with three PCIe 3.0 1x slots. The upper two slots feature MSI's Steel Armor to keep the slot from bending under the weight of larger video cards while also preventing EMI intrusion. Using this configuration, multi-GPU strategies from both AMD (3-Way) and NVIDIA (2-Way) are supported. Between the ports are the Turbo M.2 headers that can be occupied by a pair of 2242 / 2260 / 2280 / 22110 form factor NVMe drives and Optane memory. This allows access speeds of up to 32Gb/s per drive. Both of these M.2 ports are covered in MSI's Steel armor for protection. In front of the expansion slots is the bulk of the shielded Realtek ALC 1220 High Definition audio solution. MSI is using a new design that is much like what we see on the ASUS ROG offerings, using an isolated set of circuits with separate layers for the left and right audio channels. Marking the border of the PCB and audio circuitry is an RGB LED border that works with MSI's Mystic Lighting software. The 120dB SNR / 32-bit rated EMI-shielded ALC 1220 High Definition audio processor comes with a built-in DAC. A headphone impedance sensing amplifier that sets the optimal impedance for your headphones (up to 600 ohm) is used for front panel audio. MSI chose Chemicon Audio capacitors due to their solid reputation for use in quality audio solutions.     Along the bottom of the board is a majority of the board connectivity. From the left is the front panel audio header, one of the six PWM controllable fan headers, and a header for use with RGB LED strips that can be controlled with MSI's Mystic lighting software. Next up is a serial header and parallel connection header, TPM header, a pair of USB 2.0 headers, and the front panel connection point.     Up the right side of the board is another of the six controllable 4-pin fan headers and the bulk of the SATA connectivity. There are a total of six SATA 6Gbps slots on this board that support Intel's Smart Response Technologies, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10. Four of the ports point towrd the side of the PCB, while two face upwards. A change from what I normally see on boards. Next to the SATA ports are a pair of USB 3.1 headers. One upright and the other laid down to fit under a performance discrete GPU. The 24-pin ATX power connection is in a standard location with another pair of 4-pin fan connectors. The uppermost connection is for use with the water pump in any of the current AIO liquid cooling setups on the market. These fan headers can be controlled in both standard DC mode or PWM mode in both the BIOS and in MSI's Command Center application. Between the ATX power connection and the lower fan header are the EZ Debug LED's that visualize boot issues with the DRAM, VGA, CPU, or boot drive, so you know where to start your trouble shooting if there are issues. Up to 64 GB of DDR4 memory at speeds of 3800MHz is officially supported using four DIMMs. Around each DIMM slot is MSI's Steel Armor that minimizes electrical interference at the slot. By using an optimized and isolated trace layout in the PCB, DDR4 Boost ensures memory compatibility and performance are not concerns. Across the top of the PCB there is not much to discuss, but the 8-pin CPU power connection and the top half of the digital power circuit cooling.       Cooling the Military Class V digital voltage circuitry are a pair of aluminum heat sinks that follow the silver and black theme of the board. The Z270 PCH is covered with a large, low profile heat sink that easily fits under any of the large video cards on the market, including MSI's own Gaming X offerings. MSI is using a combination of Dark Chokes, Titanium chokes that run up to 30% more efficiently, and lower ESR Dark Caps as part of its Military class strategy to improve longevity of the system and components. Even with the Dark Chokes and Dark Caps encroaching on the CPU socket, these components do not interfere with any of the heat sink combinations used in my testing.     The hardware is only part of the equation when you look at the entire package that makes up the MSI Z270 SLI PLUS. The software component, BIOS, and actual performance add to this equation so that you get a full picture of what MSI has to offer. --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Introduction & Closer Look2 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Included Software3 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: The Bios4 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Specifications & Features5 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Setup & Overclocking6 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra, Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark7 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: AIDA 64, CrystalDiskMark, ATTO, iPerf, RMAA8 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Gaming9 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Introduction & Closer Look MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Included Software MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: The Bios MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Specifications & Features MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Setup & Overclocking MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra, Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: AIDA 64, CrystalDiskMark, ATTO, iPerf, RMAA MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Gaming MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Conclusion Related Products MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review Recent Articles MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review NEST Protect and NEST Learning Thermostat Review OCC's Top 3 Video Cards of 2016 Watch_Dogs 2 Performance Analysis GTX 1070 Overclocking Guide Watch_Dogs 2 Review Intel 7th Generation Core i7 7700K Processor Review Shadow Warrior 2 Performance Analysis OCC's Top 3 Cases of 2016 Shadow Warrior 2 Review » all reviews Forum Posts Hackintosh G5 at long last Switching to NVIDIA Top Priority for Nintendo Switch Do i really need to upgrade my gpu?

Maybe it was purchased when John Howard was prime minister, or you ruined it was a spilled drink, or maybe you just have some money to burn and you'd like to blow it on Intel's new Kaby Lake microarchitecture. Whatever the reason, you're ready to upgrade your computer, and you're going to be left with a big choice. Do you spend the extra cash for the categorically faster i7 processor, or do you pinch a few pennies and go with the i5? Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo After running both processors (the 4.5GHz i7-7700K and the 4.2GHz i5-7600K) through the ringer in a computer that was otherwise the exact same, we can say, without a doubt, that you should save your money. For most people the i7 just isn't worth it. Intel's New Kaby Lake Processors: What You Need To Know Read more Intel introduced the i7 and i5 brands back in 2007 as a way of guiding customers. The i5 was for "mainstream" use and the i7 was for "high-end" and business use. Spend a little extra money and the i7 should do everything faster and better. The key to the i7's speed is not in its higher clock speed (the gigahertz number), but its ability to employ hyper-threading more efficiently. In the early days of personal computing, if you wanted to speed up your computer you'd add an additional CPU. Modern Intel processors have multiple cores — which your computer sees as additional CPUs. Hyper-threading takes advantage of those cores, allowing them to doing big fancy computations in parallel instead of systemically. The i7 processor is designed to be so good at hyper-threading that it can do twice as many processes in parallel as the i5. The catch is that this whizzbang tech only really comes into play when the CPU is extremely taxed. You're not gonna max out the guts perusing Trump tweets, but you might in processing enormous sets of complex data, and that only really happens if you're in a few very specific fields of work, like 3D design, engineering or filmmaking. The Professional Work In a professional setting, the i7 creamed the i5. (Lower is better.) If you ever want to see how fast the processor in your computer is you should try to get it to "render" a file. Converting big files, like a 3D project or an enormous video file, instantly taxes a computer — to the point that some professional have computers whose only job is to render media. The i7, with it's hyper-threading ability, is an absolute champ at rendering data, especially compared to the cheaper i5. When we rendered a 3D object in Blender the i7 accomplished the feat a full four minutes and 39 seconds faster than the i5, and when we converted a giant 4K movie file in Handbrake the i7 finished the job four minutes and five seconds faster than the i5. With that kind of speed the i7 is an absolute necessity for "pros". The Regular Work In synthetic benchmarks meant to simulate average work days, the i5 and i7 were incredibly close. (Higher is better.) But there are a lot of pros in the world that aren't rendering gigabytes of data every day. We're browsing the internet, cranking out spreadsheets and maybe doing some quick photo editing. And in everyday pursuits the i7 is only marginally faster than the i5. WebXPRT is a fantastic online benchmark that mimics everyday web browsing. It renders objects online, crunches data in spreadsheets, alter images and loads web pages. The i7 scored 564 on the benchmark, but the i5's 553 score was completely within the margin of error, which means the two processors handle web browsing, and basic computer tasks, virtually identically. The i7 and i5 do similar in Gizmodo's Photoshop test as well. They also resize RAW images and convert them to JPEG at nearly the same pace. We converted 20 large RAW files and the i7 was only three seconds faster. That's hardly worth the premium an i7 processor commands. The Games And after benchmarking a couple of games it's clear the i7 isn't worth it for most gamers either. With the i7's higher clock speed and its clearly superior rendering abilities it would seem like an i7 would be better for gaming than an i5. Yet it isn't the case, especially if you're comparing the processors in a machine with a discrete graphics card (which any gamer would have). When the i7 isn't having to render all the 3D objects of the game itself, instead offloading it to the GPU, then its superiority diminishes substantially. In the Civilization VI graphics benchmark, which records the time between frames and averages it, the two processors were just 1.4 milliseconds apart. Same in the Civilization VI AI benchmark, which scores how quickly a processor computes tasks set by the game's artificial intelligence. In the Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark the i5 averaged 18.43 frames per second and the i7 averaged 18.33 fps. That puts the two just one tenth of a frame apart. These are the kind of differences that are imperceptible to the human eye. The kind of a difference that means the i7 is absolutely, positively, not worth it for gamers. In the end, while the i7 is fast, and an absolute necessity for film editors, engineers, architects and 3D designers, it's just not worth it for the rest of us. If you just plan on gaming or browsing the web, or doing a little photo editing, then save you money and get the i5 instead. It's more than enough speed for your needs. Comments beacham @beacham Feb 10, 2017, 5:43pm Hey Alex, I just wanted to point out that deciding between an i5 and an i7 chip for gaming is a little more nuanced than you’ve written. A particularly CPU dependant game can cause a bottleneck for your GPU if you are running with an i5 instead of an i7. Similarly if you’re planning on streaming (via Twitch, YouTube, etc.), you’ll want an i7 processor. (unless of course you have a dedicated streaming machine, but if you’re that far into streaming you know what equipment you need). Then there’s cooling. Kaby Lake i7s purportedly run hotter than normal, so you might want a beefier cooling solution if you’re going with one. Basically some games are more dependant on the CPU than others, so a little research goes a long way when it comes to deciding which one to go with. There is some wisdom in going with an i5 and spending the additional money elsewhere in the machine, but my personal opinion is that if you’re spending upwards of $2,000 on a machine, don’t skimp on your CPU. Reply 0 stan101 @stan101 Feb 10, 2017, 6:34pm I use 2 and 3d CAD and engineering programs and rarely have I used top of the range CPUs. Only with the largest 3d renderings do I ever consider needing a better cpu. My 10.6 inch travel laptop with Core I3 3217u can run AutoCAD2016 with multi unit 2d architectural and engineering construction plans without a hitch Along with a massive array of AutoCAD Lisps I run to speed up the processes. Dedicated structural engineering packages run fine on the little travel laptop. The trick is to have no startup applications running and no rubbish allways monitoring Antivirus in the background.. Turning off a few unused Windows 10 services also helps. Streaming is actually handled suprisingly well and all on 4GB of dual channel ram. The 4GB of ram is the bottlenext on running Photoshop CC. Lightroom 6 is handls suprisingly well with RAWs. My time is money so if I thought the need for a newer CPU on my travel laptop would be an improvement, I wouldn't hesitate. The truth is, that I haven't bothered. A very fast SSD is by far a more important component than faster / newer CPUs in the last generation for the majority of actual tasks. Reply 1 pawel04 @pawel04 Feb 10, 2017, 6:02pm Still blissfully sitting on my i5 2500k clocked at 4.5Ghz from all those years ago.. But yes, i'm slowly coming to that point where i will need to do a new built as all my parts are 4-5 gens old however i'd also mention here to those looking at buying new CPU'S to wait a month or two too see how AMD'S RYZEN performs. Reply 1 data-cain @data-cain Feb 10, 2017, 11:43pm +1 for the 2500k :D I only overclocked it (to 4.6) a few months ago when I picked up a 1070. Now, nearly every game I've tried runs at a constant 60+ fps (vsync) @ 2560x1440 with maximum settings. Reply 0 LordBluray Guest Feb 11, 2017, 4:03am Or at least wait until AMD's RYZEN arrives and pushs the price of intel chips down. Running a i7 4770k 16gb ddr3 Gtx 1060 (was a gtx 780ti but that bit the dust). Planing to upgrade for m.2 drives and rgb. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Feb 11, 2017, 1:45pm Good point about the AMD CPUs, it's been awhile since they've been truly great but the new Ryzen ones sound very promising. I'm starting to have hardware problems (motherboard is getting flaky) and I'm holding off until the Ryzen CPUs have proper reviews. I'd also suggest, that people really need to evaluate their requirements before trying to buy (if they're not tech savvy ask someone who is). The i3 CPUs are a pretty good alternative too. At least if you're just doing simple web browsing and a bit of office work (word/Excel) and you save quite a lot of money. Even using the CPUs built in video is fine as long as you're not trying to play anything more strenuous than solitaire. They may not be as good as an i5 or i7 (or Ryzen) but on a budget they're a real winner. Couple them with a decent mid range video card and you get a surprisingly decent gaming PC for 1080p or lower res. Reply 0 trishool @trishool Feb 10, 2017, 6:23pm The failure of the advise in this article that I see is that you also need to consider your future needs (ie how you think you'll be using it in the near future - want to stream 4k video from YouTube or other services? Then you might need an i7). You'll also need to consider how much you'll multi task on a computer as well which can also become write taxing. If there's only a $100 price difference I'd go the i7. Reply 0 zak @zak Feb 10, 2017, 6:39pm You're not gonna max out the guts perusing Trump tweetsBut you might max out your own guts. It may even be preferable to further perusal. p.s. your graphs are missing an axis label. Reply 1 hammer3339 @hammer3339 Feb 10, 2017, 7:38pm This is not even touching on you being able to get an AMD Ryzen CPU that is looking like a much better option at this point although the critical reviews have yet to hit the market. I say this as a person who generally only buys what they consider to be the best at the time of upgrading, for the last 6 years that's been Intel chips but, this year it's looking like AMD will take the mantle of best product so hold off until March before spending more money on a Kabylake CPU. Reply 0 2-short-planks Guest Feb 10, 2017, 8:19pm Well, I do run a lot of renders, so I'll be sticking with the i7s - I currently split the render load between two i7 systems, and it still takes a very long time. Reply 0 tatts @tatts Feb 10, 2017, 8:29pm Digital Foundry did a good vid on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XylVCItVhS4 Boils down to: There is a significant performance gain by taking the i7 over the i5 but, you're unlikely to ever see it unless every single thing is top of the line. If you're not getting a titan and 3000+mhz DDR4 RAM, your bottlenecks will be on the GPU or Memory. Though they did add that's okay, and some people prefer that. I'd prefer it. Good to future proof at least a bit. Last edited February 10, 2017 8:30 pm Reply 0 digitalpho3nix @digitalpho3nix Feb 10, 2017, 9:29pm OR... You could do the intelligent thing and not buy anything for a few weeks and wait for AMD Ryzen to drop at the start of March. If the early pricing leaks are to be believed, you will be very well served waiting for intel to drop their prices to compete with their rumoured '6900k performance for half the price'. THEN make a decision Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 7:43am What are you talking about? Ryzen is an octacore design, it's targeted at a niche market. Even DX12/Vulkan benchmarks don't properly utilise octacore designs with a single exception - Ashes of the Singularity. Clock speed is still king, and the ideal spot for cores is roughly halfway between 4C/8T and 6C. Ryzen may be appealing to people with intensive multithreading requirements but it's not a cost effective move for gaming. Aside from the fact it's more expensive than the competing 7700K, the Ryzen CPUs require a new motherboard thanks to the AM4 socket, plus either a new cooler or an adapter bracket because AM4 isn't compatible with previous socket coolers. Reply 0 digitalpho3nix @digitalpho3nix Feb 11, 2017, 10:02am Please re-read my comment; I was referring to the impending release of Ryzen putting severe pressure on Intel's prices. Reply 1 gravitas @gravitas Feb 11, 2017, 11:00am Out of interest, is the ideal spot for cores software based or due to physical or mathematical limits? Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 12:35pm Software-based. Though there are limits to how many threads you can break tasks into, and more threads means more handshaking and overhead required. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Feb 11, 2017, 1:53pm To be fair if you're buying a new CPU because your last one was bought "when John Howard was prime minister" you're going to be needing a new motherboard and cooler anyway. In fact unless you're upgrading from something only a couple years old you're probably going to be throwing away your mobo, ram and cooler. And there's not really going to be a noticeable performance difference if you're upgrading something 2 years old or less - so you'd be better saving your money for the next-next gen. Oh, and AMD have said they're shipping the Ryzen with it's own cooler (which is apparently decent). As for prices and price/performance, I'm reserving judgment until they're out and properly reviewing production models. Heck even if they're not quite as fast there's a good chance they'll drive intel prices down once there's more competition. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 4:18pm I suspect most people looking to pick up a $400+ CPU are enthusiasts that probably have hardware from the last 2 years already, but you're right that older boards might be a consideration. Still, I wouldn't. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Feb 10, 2017, 10:28pm Intel must have made some changes. Back in the day they used to claim a 15-30% gain from HT Graphics and rendering usually seem to have low effect from HT as a lot of work is now GPU based amd as for games clock rate is usually king as there is a limit to how many threads an application can simultaneously run. Hyper threading comes into its own for multitasking, running a bench mark for one application at a time won't give you a true picture of what it's capable of. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 7:49am Hyperthreading becomes more valuable in the current generation onwards thanks to DX12 and Vulkan making better use of multicore CPUs. I noted in a comment above but it has its limits, and the plateau seems to be half way between 4C/8T and 6C. 8C and 8C/8T gained nothing over 6C and in some cases lost performance. Reply 0 galtaforce @galtaforce Feb 11, 2017, 10:35am Didn't you get taught in maths class to always label and put scales on your axes? Reply 0 James @jamesh Feb 11, 2017, 4:11pm It's hard to get any useful information out of this article. Knowing that a benchmark completed 4 minutes sooner with one chip isn't particularly helpful if you don't know what the total time is. Is the improvement simply in line with the clock speed increase, or if the benchmark is actually benefiting from hyperthreading? Or is the improvement lower than expected, giving diminishing returns due to a bottleneck somewhere else in the system? Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log in Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Intel's priciest chip has 24 cores and sells for $9k Intel's Xeon E7-8894 v4 is a monster server chip with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 10 February, 2017 13:45 0 - - - - print email No Intel chip is as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The US$8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

Intel: Cannonlake will be more than 15 percent faster than Kaby Lake Intel's upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement as the company looks to gaming and VR Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 10 February, 2017 05:52 0 - - - - print email Upgrading CPU performance hasn't been a priority for Intel in many years, but that could be changing. Intel's upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement of more than 15 percent compared to its Kaby Lake chips, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Intel didn't provide exact numbers at the company's annual investor day Thursday, but the projection is based on the SysMark benchmark. Detailed performance improvement numbers will emerge over time. The performance improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake topped out at 15 percent. The CPU performance boost for Cannonlake should be at least that, Intel said. The first Cannonlake chips are scheduled to ship in the second half of this year. The chips -- called 8th-generation chips on an Intel slide -- could include Core i7 chips. Intel showed a Cannonlake chip at CES. The chip will be the first made on Intel's 10-nanometer process, which will deliver a substantial reduction in power consumption, Renduchintala said. Intel may be trying to catch up with AMD, which is boasting a 40 percent performance improvement for its upcoming Ryzen chips. Ryzen's numbers are based on IPC (instructions per cycle), an important performance metric. The benefit of high-performance PC chips isn't lost on Intel. The gaming market is exploding, especially eSports, and demand for high-performance Core i7 chips skyrocketed last year, Renduchintala said. As markets like virtual reality heat up, buyers will be motivated to upgrade to Core i7 chips from Core i3 chips. The Core i7 chips today are up to 36 percent faster than Core i3 chips, Renduchintala said. Chipmakers in past years focused on increasing performance by raising the clock frequency. But that made chips power hungry, and their focus shifted to adding cores, which boosted performance but also added battery life to laptops. Then the focus turned to integrating technologies like graphics and I/O buses inside processors. Gaming and virtual reality have brought a focus back to raw CPU performance. There's a limited scope for growth in the PC market, with gaming and VR being the bright spots, and both right now require high-performance CPUs. Unlike in the past, Intel doesn't want to sell low-margin chips that would ultimately incur a loss. Intel was "disciplined" with its PC business, and the focus was on high-margin products like Core i7 chips. Intel's highest priced PC chip is the Core i7-6950X, which is priced at US$1,723, and it generates a high profit margin for Intel. But Intel will have to contend with AMD, which is coming on strong with Ryzen. Analysts say Ryzen will start off strong in high-end gaming PCs based on the early hype, but then its success will depend on word-of-mouth recommendations. Ryzen's subsequent success in consumer laptops and desktops will depend on PC makers adopting the chip. Top 3 Reasons to Own a NAS More from Synology Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Although mayors and city managers are well aware of the issues, they often lack the resources to create effective solutions. And it’s not just a budget problem. The information that administrators use to make decisions is often incomplete and scattered across departments. Consequently, they can’t see the big picture. Nor can they measure the results of their efforts. But new solutions are emerging from the unlikeliest of sources — the humble streetlight. From Streetlight to Smart Light If you put sensors on a streetlight, it morphs into an “intelligent light” with capabilities Edison never dreamed of. Intelligent lights help cities gather information that officials can use to deploy services efficiently, save money, and run cleaner and greener overall. Current, a smart energy startup within GE, is using intelligent lights to illuminate a new way forward. By combining GE’s data analytics know-how with Intel’s secure computing expertise, Current’s streetlights reveal the state of city services and show how they can be improved. “We’re going to transform the streetlight from a pole that sits 30 feet up in the air to a sensor beacon,” said Austin Ashe, global product manager of intelligent cities at Current. The lights contain built-in sensors including cameras, thermometers, and humidity gauges, as well as a powerful Intel processor. Information gathered from the lights is sent to Predix, a GE cloud-based platform that instantly crunches data and sends the city actionable results in real time. Extending Capabilities San Diego is one of the first cities to take advantage of Current’s technology. Like most urban areas, the city suffers from traffic jams and parking problems. By using sensor-embedded LED streetlights to improve parking enforcement, the city reduced traffic by up to 30 percent and saved more than $350,000 annually in energy and maintenance costs. San Diego and other pilot cities are just the start. In the future, data from streetlight sensors could automate and connect city systems in new ways, solving once-stubborn problems with little human intervention. “The city will be able to sense itself through our technology,” said Justin Christiansen, global accounts manager at Intel. Because streetlights are ubiquitous, intelligent lights can create a dense sensor network that allows data to be collected and used to benefit residents in ways that were never possible before. For example, information from intelligent lights could reroute ambulances to get to emergencies faster, possibly saving lives, Christiansen said. Sensors might also reveal problems city managers don’t know about, such as dangerous street corners where accidents have yet to occur, but where sensors show cars barely avoiding collisions. Alerted to the problem, city engineers might make changes to prevent accidents. And, not only can these lights collect information, they can also broadcast it. Equipped with speaker systems, they’re able to sound alerts before a hurricane or an earthquake. Streetlights Can Even Help Fight Crime Current is working with ShotSpotter to create streetlights that can detect the sound of gunfire and send the location of the incident to police stations, dispatch centers and officers’ smartphones. Cameras in the streetlights can take photos automatically when a shot is detected, helping police identify suspects. Although ShotSpotter has been around for years, putting the technology into streetlights instead of single-purpose sensors enables cities to expand its presence at minimal cost. A Peek Inside the Lights Pumping data to the cloud can be expensive, particularly for bandwidth-hungry applications such as video. To get around this problem, the streetlight itself can do initial processing of sensor information. This activity is known as edge processing because it occurs on the fringes of the network. The importance of edge processing was one factor that led GE to partner with Intel. The company’s processors have the performance to handle tough edge processing applications such as computer vision. The robust performance also helps future-proof the platform — meaning cities won’t have to replace their streetlights when their needs grow. GE also worked closely with Intel to ensure cities can perform software updates and other maintenance remotely — even across hundreds of thousands of streetlights. Unleashing Creativity GE’s lighting is engineered to be highly secure, with information protected from the edge to the cloud. The strength of this security is evidenced by the fact that Predix is already being implemented by nuclear power plants and health care facilities. Because sensor-gathered information is stored securely, the platform can safely support open data initiatives. These initiatives can unleash creativity in communities — anyone from a local business owner to a smart high school kid can code an idea into a solution. And cities don’t have to worry about these solutions stressing the system. Predix was built for the IoT and can digest extraordinary amounts of data, Ashe said. Getting everything connected is similarly worry-free. Intelligent streetlights can be programmed to connect automatically with any available communications network — cellular, wireless or satellite. Smarter Lights, Smarter City With the addition of sensors, streetlights can be the backbone that supports city departments, helping them deliver services efficiently, cut costs, increase revenue, enhance safety and solve environmental problems. As Christiansen said: “Yesterday, your lighting fixture was a light bulb. Tomorrow, the possibilities are endless.” When humble light fixtures are outfitted with sensors and connected to the cloud, they can unleash truly brilliant ideas for cities, buildings and factories.  Like This Article?

Credit: Intel More like this AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip AMD sets up Ryzen chip for a strong start as battle with Intel looms Intel packs more horsepower into its monster 22-core processor Video Mingis on Tech: Floating solar panels, a VR update -- and Tom Brady? No Intel chip is as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The US$8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

The new processors will feature higher clock speeds but will be based on the same Kaby Lake microarchitecture and have higher TDP figures. Intel Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K Reportedly In The Works – Higher Clocks, Higher TDP But Same Architecture The upcoming chips have been reported by CPCHardware who mention that the new Intel CPUs are a direct response to Ryzen. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, said that he is confident that their company’s Kaby Lake chip will be able to tackle Ryzen. All details point to Ryzen being AMD’s most competitive processor family after many years. Intel is aware of this and are now preparing a few new processors to tackle the mainstream Zen based processors. The two new processors coming in from Intel include the Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K. As the name shows, these will be part of the current 7th generation processors. The architecture would remain the same but will be different when it comes to technical specifications. Reports from Benchlife confirm that these will be part of the Kaby Lake-X family which will be available in August 2017. Intel Core i7-7740K Processor Specifications – The Fastest Quad Core Chip The Intel Core i7-7740K processor will become the fastest Core i7 chip in the Kaby Lake lineup. It will replace the Core i7-7700K with slightly better specs. This chip features a quad core, hyper-threaded design. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. Advertisement The clock speeds are rated 4.3 GHz base and 4.5 GHz boost. The processor packs 8 MB of L3 cache and has a TDP of 112W. There’s no word on the retail price but it should be a bit higher or if Intel does feel like offering real competition to the Ryzen chips, they could price it the same as the Core i7-7700K while dropping the former in price. i7-7700K vs A10-7700K: IGP Gaming Performance Showdown Intel Core i5-7640K Processor Specifications – First Core i5 For HEDT Platforms The Intel Core i5-7640K processor will be the first instance of a Core i5 chip on the HEDT platform. This chip features a quad core design along with four threads. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. The clock speeds are rated 4.0 GHz base but boost is also configured at 4 GHz. The processor packs 6 MB of L3 cache. The TDP is rated at 112W, just like the Core i7 processor in the Kaby Lake-X family.. Other updates will include support for quad channel memory which will be a good bump over dual channel. The new X299 platform would offer more PCIe lanes from the CPU and PCH. Intel may be prompted to use a lower price tag if they want this to compete against quad or even hexacore Ryzen chips.

The higher TDP may compensate for some good overclocks but that remains to be seen. We have already noticed that the Kaby Lake chips have higher temperatures that come from higher clock speeds. The higher clocked Kaby Lake-X variants would come with better thermal designs to suit high-end desktop requirements. The Kaby Lake-X processors will debut alongside the Skylake-X processors on the X299 platform. These chips will be compatible with the LGA 2066 socket and will come with a wide set of features in terms of storage and I/O.

Stock Jumped 13% Last Month The self-driving tech company got a boost last month as it furthered some key partnerships and got several bullish notes from analysts. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Feb 9, 2017 at 8:29PM What happened Shares of Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) were surging last month, gaining 13% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Image source: Mobileye. The self-driving car specialist benefited from a deal with BMW and Intel in the beginning of the month and later jumped on an analyst upgrade. MBLY data by YCharts. So what  Mobileye stock jumped out of the gate to start the new year, gaining 8% on Jan. 3 after announcing the deal with BMW and Intel. The three partners said they would put a fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of the year, and Mobileye is also planning with the car maker and tech company to bring autonomous vehicles to market by 2021. On the same day, the Israeli company announced a strategic partnership with NIO, an electric vehicle start-up. Later in the month, the stock continued to move higher as it got endorsements from several research firms and banks including Goldman Sachs, which lifted its rating on Mobileye to buy and gave it a $50 price target, saying the company was well positioned for upcoming opportunities in the autonomous driving space. Now what  There's no shortage of enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles on Wall Street. The consensus among tech companies, automakers, and others seems to be that at least partially autonomous vehicles will become commonplace within five to 10 years.  However, for investors, Mobileye is one of the few pure-play stocks available. Shares of rival NVIDIA nearly tripled last year on growing possibilities in the industry. Mobileye's partnerships across the spectrum of automakers seem encouraging, and the company is solidly profitable. No one knows for sure where autonomous vehicles are going, but Mobileye looks like a solid bet for investors itching for a piece of a potentially huge industry.

In a meeting with airline executives Thursday, he signaled that some “phenomenal” pro-growth tax-cut plan should be announced “over the next two or three weeks.” He promised “rolling back burdensome regulations” in the same sitdown. The Dow proceeded to jump 118 points on the day. Meanwhile, tangible benefits of the new sheriff in Washington continue to roll in. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Intel announced a $7 billion investment in a Chandler, Ariz., plant that will add 3,000 jobs (beyond the construction work). Intel had started the factory in President Barack Obama’s first term (a fact Obama milked in a visit during the 2012 campaign), then mothballed it in 2014 as business prospects dimmed. CEO Brian Krzanich said Intel revived the plant because of “the tax and regulatory policies we see the [Trump] administration pushing forward.” The new jobs will add about 6 percent to Intel’s US workforce. This, of course, follows a host of other one-off announcements of new or saved jobs going back to the Carrier deal just after Election Day. No, company-by-company deals alone won’t Make America Great Again. Big-picture changes — above all, tax reform and that regulatory rollback — have to come. But don’t knock the psychological effect. As Kevin Plank, the Under Armour CEO, said Tuesday on CNBC, “He’s highly passionate. To have such a pro-business president is something that’s a real asset to this country.” Plank also praised the president’s attitude: “I’m a big fan of people that operate in the world of ‘publish and iterate’ versus, you know, ‘think, think, think, think.’ ” Sounds like the right way to get jobs, jobs, jobs.

When a major silicon bug makes itself known, like the Pentium FDIV bug and the AMD Phenom TLB problems of years past, the costs can be enormous. These bugs only cause problems bad enough to make their way into the public eye once in a blue moon, but today's is a doozy. The Register reports that a circuit degradation problem inside some Intel Atom C2000 embedded CPUs can render systems with those chips inside permanently unable to boot. El Reg says that neither Intel nor any of the companies whose products are apparently affected by the issue would actually confirm or deny that C2000 Atom CPUs are the point of failure, but Synology apparently tipped Intel's hand when it issued a statement to the site regarding some of its storage appliances. That statement confirmed that Synology products with C2000 chips inside were affected, but the company said it hadn't seen an increase in failure rates related to the parts. Synology subsequently requested that The Register remove all mentions of Intel and Intel products from its earlier statement. Synology isn't the only company that used Intel C2000 products, however. Cisco recently issued an advisory to its customers noting that it "became aware of an issue related to a component manufactured by one supplier that affects some Cisco products. In some units, we have seen the clock signal component degrade over time. " The company wouldn't admit the name of the supplier to The Register, but Intel's own erratum update (AVR54 in this document) states that "the SoC LPC_CLKOUT0 and/or LPC_CLKOUT1 signals (Low Pin Count bus clock outputs) may stop functioning" in affected chips. Those clock signals are apparently related to critical functions performed on boot, and without them, a system is dead in the water. The Register used that info to put two and two together. Cisco did provide a list of products it expects will experience increased failures related to the C2000 processors, and it says the issue could start rearing its head after the affected gear is in operation for 18 months or so. The company will replace affected components so long as they're under warranty or a service contract. If you have some Cisco switches or ASA security applicances, be sure to check whether they're affected. For its part, Intel told The Register that a "board-level workaround" could be applied to systems in production with the affected steppings of its products. The blue team will also be issuing a new stepping of the Atom C2000 series to resolve the issue at an SoC level. There's no telling what the cost of this issue will be to Intel or its suppliers once the pace of failures picks up, though.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The thing is, the Z270 is overkill for most users' needs. For folks who aren't overclocking and don't need three M.2 sockets, a B-series chipset will serve just fine. Gigabyte clearly agrees, as the company's new B250M-Gaming 5 motherboard packs a fancy feature set worthy of a high-end gamer board but skips the high-end chipset. In this case, the fancy features include metal-reinforced DIMM slots and PCIe x16 slots, a dedicated water pump power header, RGB LED lighting, and an RGB LED header for controlling a light strip. The B250M-Gaming 5 also uses an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller and a high-end Realtek ALC1220 audio codec accompanied by Gigabyte's "Amp-Up" smart headphone amplifier. Gigabyte says the board fully supports Intel's Optane cache devices in its M.2 socket, too. M.2 devices up to 110 mm in length will fit nicely in the board. The B250M-Gaming 5 does suffer a little for its use of a budget chipset. Despite having two metal-reinforced PCIe x16 slots, it has no SLI support. The board supports AMD's Crossfire, but the second card connects to the chipset with four PCIe 3.0 lanes, and has to contend with the rest of the devices for DMI bandwidth. Memory speed is limited to 2400 MT/s, too, since that's all the B250 chipset supports. Finally, there are no USB 3.1, Thunderbolt, or U.2 connectors. Still, for gamers on a budget, this board could be a winner. Aside from the high-speed memory support, none of the missing features have much effect on gaming performance. One of those Pentium G4620s slotted in this motherboard could make for a potent value proposition. The company hasn't revealed pricing or availability yet for the B250M-Gaming 5, but we have some expectation that it's a reasonably affordable model.   Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel announced plans for this new facility after the company’s CEO Brian Krzanich met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. According to a White House official, when built, the new multi-billion dollar factory would be “the most advanced semiconductor facility in the world” and will employ more than 3,000 people. The new Intel factory will be located in Chandler, Arizona where Intel already has facilities that employ over 10,000 people. The new factory would be set up in the next three to four years. In addition to the new plant, another plant that was partly built and left vacant would be revived. The new facility will be used to make the new seven nanometer chips that Intel plans to debut in the next few years. Speaking to news outlets after the meeting with the President, Krzanich revealed that Intel remains committed to the U.S. while adding that the company still maintains most of its manufacturing facilities within the country. In a statement released by him later, he said, “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” President Donald Trump with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. [Image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Images] In an email to Intel employees, Krzanich discussed his company’s growth. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on. This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry. Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise.” According to Intel, the new facility will be called Fab 42. The company added that the new plant would also help local businesses and fuel long-term job opportunities in the region. “The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona.” The site where the new Intel factory will be built. [Image by Intel Corporation] After the meeting and the subsequent announcement, President Trump tweeted his thanks to Krzanich and called the factory a great investment. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst???????? pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 In the internal email to Intel employees, the CEO attempted to preemptively answer queries from employees. One of the first questions that was addressed talked about the need for Intel to make this announcement at the White House? This is what Brian had to say about it. “Intel is proud of the fact that the majority of our wafer manufacturing and R&D is based in the United States. This is due to the great infrastructure we have at our U.S. sites, our talented and highly skilled workforce and the proximity to our R&D facilities in Oregon. We’ve maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of our product is sold outside the United States—we’re one of the top 5 exporters and top 2 R&D spenders in the U.S.—and despite the fact that from a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete. That’s why we support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies.” Interestingly, this development has come close on the heels of several technology companies, including Intel, filing a legal brief that opposed Trump;s controversial travel freeze.

This is an interesting development with the recent launch of Intel’s 7th Generation Core products being touted as the ‘optimization’ behind the new ‘Process-Architecture-Optimization’ three-stage cadence that had replaced the old ‘tick-tock’ cadence. With Intel stringing out 14nm (or at least, an improved variant of 14nm as we’ve seen on 7th Gen) for another generation, it makes us wonder where exactly Intel can promise future performance or efficiency gains on the design unless they start implementing microarchitecture changes. Despite this, if you were to believe supposed ‘leaked’ roadmaps (which we haven’t confirmed from a second source as of yet), the 8th Generation product ‘Cannon Lake’ is more geared towards the Y and U part of Intel’s roadmap. This would ring true with a mobile first strategy that Intel has mirrored with recent generations such that the smaller, low power chips are off the production line for a new product first, however we'd also expect 10nm to also be in the smaller chips first too (as demonstrated at CES). Where Cannon Lake will end up in the desktop or enterprise segment however remains to be seen. To put something a bit more solid into this, Ashraf also mentioned words from Dr. Venkata ‘Murthy’ Renduchintala, VP and GM of Client and IoT: ‘Murthy referred to it at the event, process tech use will be ‘fluid’ based on segment’. If one read too much into this, we may start seeing a blend of process nodes for different segments at the same time for different areas of the market. We already do have that to some extent with the mainstream CPUs and the HEDT/Xeon families, but this phrasing seems that we might get another split between consumer products or consumer and enterprise. We may get to a point where Intel's 'Gen' naming scheme for its CPUs covers two or more process node variants. Speaking of the Enterprise segment, another bit of information has also surfaced, coming from a slide during a talk by Diane Bryant (EVP/GM of Data Center) and posted online by Ashraf. The slide contains the words ‘Data center first for next process node’ We can either talk about process node in terms of the ‘number’, either 14nm/10nm/7nm, or by variants within that process (high power, high efficiency). One might suspect that this means Intel is moving hard and fast with 10nm for Xeons and big computing projects, despite showing off 10nm silicon at CES earlier this year. That being said, it’s important to remember that the data center market is large, and includes high-density systems with many cores, such as Atom cores, and Intel did recently open up its 10nm foundry business to ARM Artisan IP projects. So while the slide does say ‘Data center first’, it might be referring to DC projects based on ARM IP in that segment rather than big 4-24+ core Xeons. At this stage of the game it is hard to tell. On top of all this, Intel still has extreme confidence in its foundry business. An image posted by Dick James of Siliconics from the livestream shows Intel expects to have a three-year process node advantage when its competitors (Samsung, TSMC) start launching 10nm: I’ve been brief with this news for a reason - at this point there are a lot of balls in the air with many different ways to take this information, and the Investor Day is winding down on talks and finishing with smaller 1-on-1 meetings. We may get further clarification on this news as the day goes on. Update 1: On speaking with Diane Bryant, the 'data center gets new nodes first' is going to be achieved by using multiple small dies on a single package. But rather than use a multi-chip package as in previous multi-core products, Intel will be using EMIB as demonstrated at ISSCC: an MCP/2.5D interposer-like design with an Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB). An Intel Slide from ISSCC, via PC Watch Initially EMIB was thought of as a technology relating to Intel's acquisition of Altera and potential future embedded FPGA designs, and given the slide above and comments made at the Investor Day, it seems there are other plans for this technology too. The benefit of using multiple smaller dies over a large monolithic 600mm2 die is typically related to cost and yield, however the EMIB technology also has to be up to par and there may be a latency or compatibility trade-off.

POST A COMMENT 97 Comments View All Comments Yojimbo - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link "Data centers first to new nodes". Does this mean Intel is going to accept lower margins on its data center hardware in order to chase the growth that exists in that segment and to try to stem off competition? Reply witeken - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link You are correct, D. Bryant has said they expect operating margin the shrink from in the high-40 % to low-40%. The EMIB technology to slip the die in chiplets is a really, really big deal to achieve this data center first strategy, which in itself is already a monumental and underrated change of business. Compare this to TSMC and Samsung, who go mobile first. Intel is now doing opposite. Reply Gondalf - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link You are wrong. Intel will go mobile (CORE M and 15W line) and datacenter first with 10nm. LIke have done on 14nm. Nothing is changed. This time Intel refuse to delay datacenter SKUs and adopt the multidie approach to stay ahead the competition in spite the impossibility to manufacture large die SKUs at the beginning of the new node ramp. EMIB was patented for this in 2014. I don't see any monumental change of business, so sorry Reply witeken - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link Diane Bryant has said that this change will start with 10nm++, and then 7nm as the first full node. This is, she said, because it takes many years to build these products, so the development for the first 10nm products are already well under way. Reply Yojimbo - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link Intel didn't go data center first with 14nm. 14nm Xeon E5s didn't come out until the beginning of 2016 whereas 14nm was used on other products (lower power, mobility parts) as early as late 2014. Mobile Core i processors used it in early 2015 and desktop Core i processors used it in the middle of 2015. Reply name99 - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link To me this looks like a desperate action, not a careful plan. It suggests that they expect 10nm yields to be so bad for a while that they simply will not be able to ship mobile volumes, even if they repeat the pathetic multi-quarter extended rollout of Broadwell, one SKU at a time. Even assuming EMIB works wonderfully and delivers something like what it claims, client delivers twice the revenue of data center, and there's much more value to a better performing chip (faster single-threaded, and lower power) in mobile than in data center (ie more people will pay more for it). They're going data center first because they HAVE TO, not because they want to. Reply iwod - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link This implies either IBM Power 8 is really going to be a threat or AMD Zen is finally catching up. Reply revanchrist - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link 14nm Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake? Reply Cygni - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link That's what the leaked documents showed. That plus the discussion about using EMIB to cobble together smaller dies for server parts, as well as the fact that Intel let Fab 42 sit after billions in construction rather than installing 10nm production equipment, leads me to believe that 10nm has been a bit of a disaster for Intel. 14nm was obviously a struggle at first and things didn't get any easier it appears.

The 70-year-old businessman and political novice wrapped up his third week in the Oval Office with a bruising defeat after the courts upheld a freeze on his travel ban targeting refugees and travellers from seven mostly-Muslim nations — his most emblematic measure to date. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip approach to high office has fired up a despondent political opposition with a new sense of purpose as huge segments of US society rally in “resistance” to his presidency. Millions of Americans have filled the streets in protest at his plans to “make America great again,” while his brash forays into global diplomacy have rattled key allies from Australia to Germany. When Trump delivered his election victory speech in November, it seemed — for a fleeting moment — he would work to pull the country back together after a bitterly divisive campaign. It has since become clear that Trump has chosen to speak to the loyal base of Americans who backed his insurgent bid for the White House — and to them alone. That decision is grounded in the unflinching support Trump still enjoys among his core supporters, even as his approval rating among Americans at large sits at record lows. As political strategies go, it’s a risky one — all the more so since he is now locked in what is sure to be an arduous legal battle over his clampdown on immigration in the name of national security. Thursday’s decision by an appellate court in San Francisco, upholding a lower court suspension on the controversial decree, was a major blow to the president. The case is now likely to wind up before the Supreme Court. Trump’s camp was at pains to stress — with reason — that the ruling concerned only the temporary stay on his executive order, not the constitutionality of the ban itself. But it carries heavy symbolic weight, as does the fact that the appellate panel’s three judges were appointed both by Republican and Democratic leaders: Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” a defiant Trump quickly tweeted after the ruling, in one of the all-caps tweets he uses to convey anger and exasperation. ‘Venom’ Trump is far from the first US president to be thwarted by the courts. But his angry, personal response to the ruling — and his virulent attacks on the judiciary in the run-up to it — have astonished even observers accustomed to his daily Twitter outbursts targeting everyone from political foes to the media to television celebrities. In a New York Times editorial entitled “Trump’s Leading Rivals Wear Robes,” Charles Blow recalled that Obama had also spoken out strongly against a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for unlimited political spending by corporations. Obama was brutally criticised at the time, even though his objections were confined to “the ruling itself and not impugning in any way the character or qualifications of the justices who rendered it,” Blow noted. “But it is impossible to argue that his judicial rebuke, which looks quaint in retrospect, comes anywhere close to the venom Donald Trump is spewing at the judicial branch,” he wrote. “The only courts or press that Trump sees as legitimate are those that bow to his will.” ‘Larger man inside?’ After the real estate mogul’s upset win over Hillary Clinton, Obama was at pains to stress — perhaps to reassure a shell-shocked Democratic camp — that the sheer gravity of the world’s most powerful job necessarily changed a man. One thing is certain at this point: so far, the presidency has not changed Trump. At least part of his White House team seems determined to replicate word-for-word the recipe that propelled Trump to victory, rolled out in rally after giant rally from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania. “Part of the reason the president got elected is because he speaks his mind,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday. “He doesn’t hold it back, he’s authentic, and he’s not going to sit back.” It remains to be seen whether the turmoil of Trump’s first three weeks in power — and the small but growing number of dissenting voices in his Republican camp — will lead him to change course, or adapt his tone. For the writer and long-time US radio host Garrison Keillor, the answer is in little doubt. “What we know so far is that the man is who he is,” Keillor wrote recently in The Chicago Tribune. “There is no larger, finer man inside him trying to get out.”  “Everyone who is paying attention knows this.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain Trump warns Iran president he ‘better be careful’ Shallow quake hits southern Taiwan Tourist critically injured in Hong Kong subway arson attack India’s Modi faces biggest election test since 2014 landslide Brazil deploys troops to city with no police Melania Trump suit alleges escort claims cost her 'millions' (VIDEO) French leaders try to stem fury over alleged police rape Obama enjoys watersports with Virgin chief on luxury island (VIDEO) Iran leader rebuffs Trump warning, says he shows America’s ‘real face’ Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain Hundreds of immigrants arrested in ‘routine’ US enforcement surge Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) 12870 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump has quietly signed an executive order changing the order of succession in the Department of Justice, reversing an executive order by President Obama signed just last month. The order appears to be the first that Trump has not signed in a public ceremony. It's dated Thursday — the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in — but was not posted to the White House website until Friday morning. The White House did not explain the discrepancy. The executive order spells out who will act as the nation's highest law enforcement officer if the attorney general dies, resigns or becomes incapacitated. Such orders have been routine since the 2001 terrorist attacks, but Trump's is notable becomes it comes two weeks after he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning travelers from seven predominately Muslim countries. That time, Trump went outside the official order of succession — as he has the right to do — to elevate Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to acting attorney general. Because the Senate has not confirmed any other top Justice Department officials, Boente will continue to be second in the line of succession under Trump's order, followed by Zachary Fardon, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and Tammy Dickinson, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri. Seven days before he left office, President Obama changed the order of succession without explanation to remove Boente from the list. Obama's order had listed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Illinois and the Central District of California. The top positions remain unchanged: the deputy attorney general, the associate attorney general and — at the discretion of the attorney general — the solicitor general and other assistants. But because those positions are now officially vacant, the order currently skips to the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys.

This episode the crew tackles the topic of sports on TV, on the internet, and in person. Live streaming of sporting events is something we’d all like to see happen more often (and better), but there are roadblocks from the league and from the networks that need to be cleared. Highlights and full-length broadcasts in VR are also pretty dope—when they work properly. It’s not all bad news though; we visit the best intersections of sports and the internet. Halfway through the episode, WIRED writer Paul Sarconi talks to Populous, an architecture firm that designs stadiums with the aim to substantially improve the fan experience.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) More WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Read More Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit $15 Soon BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Worth $8 a Share View All Posts There is nothing more painful for investors than watching a stock that once traded at $1.81 soaring six-fold in the last year. The higher shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) goes, the riskier it gets for investors. AMD stock still has $1.44 billion in debt against $1.26 billion in cash and equivalents. In early March, the chip supplier is about to make its biggest launch its his history with Ryzen, and that’s bound to make a lot of noise. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr For the time being, details of AMD’s Ryzen are limited. Although the company recently demoed the chip in a gameplay demonstration, it gave no details on the chip’s pricing. Without knowing what Ryzen offers at a price-to-performance ratio compared to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), the harder it is to predict Ryzen’s sales when it launches. AMD’s (Leaked) Ryzen Roadmap If the leaked rumors are true, AMD will launch three classes of PC chips: high-range, medium-range and entry-level. Denoted R7 (8 core, 16 threads), R5 (4-6 core, 8-12 threads) and R3 (4 core, 4 threads), respectively, the CPUs will differ by core, thread and clock speed. The mid- and high-range chips will compete with Intel’s mainstream processors, the i5 and i7. Click to Enlarge Ryzen’s processor speed does not aim to out-clock that of Intel chips. Rather, AMD’s strategy primarily targets the enthusiast PC game community. Ryzen will pair with the next-generation GPU (graphics processing unit) Vega chips. After Ryzen’s launch in March, AMD will release Vega sometime in the second quarter. Mentions of Ryzen picked up again on Feb 9. Ryzen’s Processor Size Although Advanced Micro Devices is manufacturing Zen on 14nm, its an area of 44 square millimeters implies that the chip will at least match or beat Intel’s chips. Before Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD did not talk about manufacturing at 14nm. Prior to Ryzen, Advanced Micro Devices embraced x86 chips at 28nm. The engineering achievement will lead to lower manufacturing costs and higher profit margins for AMD stock. On its conference call, the company revealed that it aimed to achieve gross margin of around 33% in the first quarter. In the quarters before that, its gross margin hovered in the 31%-range due to the product mix. With Ryzen on the list, expect that profitability number to improve quarter after quarter.

USA TODAY NETWORK President Trump speaks during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Feb. 10, 2017, in the East Room of the White House. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) 9836 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 274 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump said Friday he's considering a new executive order on refugees as soon as Monday or Tuesday, even as his administration mulls an appeal of a court decision suspending his previous order barring travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. "We will win that battle," Trump said of the court fight. "We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." The shifting White House strategy marked the beginning of a third weekend of chaotic developments on the travel ban, which has stranded air travelers and led to nationwide protests and legal challenges. After a three-judge panel refused to reinstate the travel ban on Thursday, the next stop would ordinarily be the Supreme Court. But a potential roadblock emerged late Friday, when a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco asked for the case to be heard by the full court of appeals, setting a deadline of next Thursday for arguments on that question. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One Friday, suggested that a new executive order would be the most expedient route. "It very well could be. We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be." The new order would include additional security measures, Trump said. "We have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting and we're going very strong on security.  We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason," he said. The San Francisco appeals court decision came in response to a challenge from Washington State, which sued to block provisions of the order temporarily barring nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from traveling to the United States. A key part of that opinion struck at a provision of Trump's order applying it to permanent legal residents. White House Counsel Donald McGahn later issued a memo clarifying that the ban did not include so-called "green card" holders, but the appeals court said the memo did not have the force of an executive order and can only be corrected by another executive order. The Trump administration also continued to fend off legal challenges on other fronts Friday, including in Alexandria, Va. A federal judge there offered a blistering critique of the travel ban, citing a "startling" lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represented a specific national security threat. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema did not immediately rule on a request for a nationwide preliminary injunction against the order, but she characterized its language as overly "broad and imprecise." Trump's comments on Air Force One, while traveling to his winter home in Mar-a-Lago, Fla. to golf with the Japanese prime minister, came after he deflected similar questions in a news conference earlier in the day. "We'll be going forward and we’ll be doing things that will continue to make this country safe. It will happen rapidly," he said at the White House. "I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will have extreme vetting, which is a term I developed early in my campaign, because I saw what was happening." Contributing: David Jackson in Washington and Kevin Johnson in Alexandria, Va.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 10, 2017 2:27pm   Comments Share: Related INTC Nvidia Remains One Of The Most Exciting Growth Stories In Tech Intel: 4 Reasons To Overlook Disappointing Margin Outlook And Buy The Stock Intel Down After Analyst Day; Monolithic Power Rises On Q4 Report (Investor's Business Daily) Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital said Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) have set a low bar for the next three years with disappointing margin guidance, as it is positioning itself for long-term growth by diversifying away from PC business. Inte's Outlook Intel expects its gross margin to decline modestly over the next three years, due to expectations for higher revenue growth in memory, modems and adjacent products. However, it would remain in the top half of historical range at 63 percent. The chip giant also cut its DCG (DataCenter Group) operating margin outlook to the low- to mid-40 percent range from prior range of 45 to 50 percent over 2017 to 2021. Intel also guided CCG (Client Computing Group) to decline low-single-digits with new businesses to increase double-digits resulting in overall revenue increasing low single-digits over the next three years. “We came away from INTC's investor meeting incrementally more confident that INTC is making the right "big bets" for the long-term growth of the company and reiterate our Buy rating and $42 price target,” Van Hees wrote in a note. The DCG margin cut guidance reflects Intel’s ramp DCG products first on its next process technology rather than at CCG traditionally, and higher expected mix of non-processor sales within DCG, which carry lower margins. As a sign of diversification, Intel expects its traditional PC CPU TAM (total available market) to drop to about $30 billion in 2021 from $32 billion in 2016 and data center to increase to $65 billion from $13 billion in 2016. Analyst Day Takeaways  Other highlights of the analyst day include: Intel’s TAM should grow to $220 billion in 2021 from $45 billion in 2016. Intel will invest more in DCG and IoT chips. Intel is confident that it has a three-year manufacturing lead over competing foundries. Intel to ship its first 5G modem this year on 14 nm, and expects shipments in the millions in 2018. Intel also expects 14 nm LTE modem shipments in the tens of millions in 2018, which implies retention of share at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) at a minimum. At last check, shares of Intel were down 0.62 percent to $35.24.

Trying Nouveau NVC0 Gallium3D With Civilization 6 On Mesa 17.1 Written by Michael Larabel in Nouveau on 10 February 2017 at 01:53 PM EST. 4 Comments With Intel Kabylake graphics on Mesa working (albeit very slowly) for Aspyr Media's latest Linux game port, Civilization VI, and RadeonSI Gallium3D running too albeit at a less than desirable speed, I decided to try running the open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver with this latest AAA Linux game release. I tried Nouveau NVC0 Gallium3D from Mesa 17.1-devel Git this morning. I was running the Linux 4.10 kernel and had enabled NvBoost=2 mode and re-clocked the graphics card to its 0f performance state. The NVIDIA graphics card for this open-source driver testing was the GeForce GTX 780 Ti Kepler. Unfortunately, when launching Civilization VI with Nouveau NVC0 on Kepler, I got a black screen... Right away, it didn't get far at all. It wasn't a hard hang, but was able to switch to a VT. Civ6 ended up having a segmentation fault in the Nouveau driver and there are various Nouveau DRM errors and TTM buffer eviction failures reported. Well, at least another new test case for the community developers working on the open-source Nouveau Gallium3D stack. If it were to run, it would probably be fairly slow even with the re-clocking and boosting given the results we've seen with the NVIDIA proprietary driver and RadeonSI Gallium3D driver -- check out those articles if you haven't done so already. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Prepares For Mainline GVT-g Graphics Virtualization Support Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 10 February 2017 at 12:58 PM EST. 6 Comments Intel's open-source developers maintaining GVT-g for Linux graphics virtualization support for their hardware are working on migrating their development workflow from this code that's been out-of-tree since its inception to now being mainline. With the imminent Linux 4.10 release, the initial pieces of GVT support are mainline for allowing Xen/KVM guest VMs to access the Intel graphics hardware of the host. All the pieces are coming together but it still might be a few months before everything is usable for production standards and running smoothly and mainline throughout all the interconnected components of the open-source Linux virtualization stack. There is more details on the experimental virtual GPU support in Linux 4.10 via this article for those behind on their Phoronix reading. Intel's Hongbo Wang laid out more details today on their transition period for Intel Graphics Virtualization Technology as everything works to be mainline. As expected, they will be shifting their development focus to the upstream repositories. For those interested in GVT-g and wishing to learn more details, their transition plan was laid out this morning in this mailing list message. Once everything is settled with GVT-g in a kernel release or two, I plan to deliver some Intel graphics virtualization benchmarks on Phoronix. 6 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Pop star Lady Gaga points at the flying devices that lit up behind her during her Superbowl LI performance. Screenshot from NFL/YouTube MANILA, Philippines – Pop star Lady Gaga rocked the Super Bowl LI – one of the biggest sporting events in the US – on Sunday, February 5, with an electrifying halftime show, performing some of her biggest hits infront of millions of people. Just as she finished the first song in her repertoire, LED lights that appeared to be magically flying formed the US flag behind her. The lights, as it turns out, were being carried by drones: drones that were usually used to take photos and video, were this time the ones worth taking a photo of. The lights sure looked pretty. But who's the creative genius behind them? Apparently, the number-crunchers at tech giant Intel were, part of an ongoing experiment to transform drones from individual working units to a swarm that knows how to work together. Here are some facts you might want to know: 1) This isn't the first time that the drones were deployed in a performance. Before the Lady Gaga performance, the Shooting Stars, as they are called, had another high-profile performance. It started in late 2016 when the drones appeared at a 3-week show in Disney World in the US. The drones were part of the theme park's holiday program, and were seen forming Christmas-themed symbols such as Christmas trees and doves. Intel partnered with the entertainment titan in order to showcase the technology they were working on. Take a look: 2) They are controlled by a single computer One computer controls the flight and the formation of the said drones. Techcrunch, which got a close look at the Shooting Stars before they were deployed at Disney, said that the software is a crucial cog in the program. The drones aren't smart by themselves and aren't equipped to detect collissions. Instead, the software figures out and pre-programs routes that will prevent collisions and successfully complete the desired formations. The computer also checks battery levels and GPS signal strength. When one goes down, the Shooting Star system ensures that there are reserve drones ready to take flight and take over its fallen comrade's spot. 3) Intel has been developing the technology for 2 years now INTEL FORMATION. The drones form the Intel logo at one demonstration. Photo from Guinness World Records Partnering with technology researchers and artists alike, the tech giant seeks to apply this drone fleet technology beyond entertainment purposes. Working like a swarm, it is hoped that the drones will be able to accomplish bigger tasks in areas such as search and rescue or inspecting areas hazardous to humans, to name a few. In Intel's imagination, no drone is an island. 4) Currently, up to 10,000 drones can be controlled at one time The technology, given enough time to develop further, might just be able to accomplish really great things. The underlying technology is said to be "limitless in scale" Intel told Techcrunch, with the current version of the software able to control 10,000 flying devices at a time. The claim has not been demonstrated yet though, with Intel's record for number of Shooting Star drones flown in unison standing at 500. The Guinness World Record-setting performance (officially titled "Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Airborne Simultaneously"), held in Germany, can be seen in the embedded video below. 5) They're easy to transport and assemble They're about as heavy as a volleyball with a housing made of Styrofoam, and can be assembled in 15 minutes, says Techcrunch. The multicolored LED light is located at the bottom of the drone. Specifically, each drone is 8 ounces. The drones are designed with soft housing in order to lessen the physical impact in case they bump into one another. The onboard LED is able to come up with 4 billion color combinations, says Wired. 6) The Superbowl performance is the biggest show yet for the Shooting Stars The Stars performed in front of an estimated global audience of 160 million people. Another big feat is that the Shooting Star were the only drones in attendance that night. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forbids drones within the area; Intel and the Superbowl creative team had to secure permits to make what may have been a landmark moment for drones. – Rappler.com Filed under:Intel•Lady Gaga•United States•drones•Super Bowl LI HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

However experts say it’s lacking one crucial element for a company turnaround: a plan to drive sales. “From a bankruptcy perspective, you have to have two components: identify and reduce losses, and you also have to have a measure to increase income,” said Chuck Tatelbaum, senior attorney in the bankruptcy and creditors’ rights department at the Tripp Scott law firm. Much of what was outlined in the announcement was “vague,” he said, like strategies to “drive efficiencies” through things like pricing and inventory management. And ultimately, it doesn’t speak to the problem of customers not buying what Sears or Kmart are selling. See also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy’, and there may be no remedy “All that verbiage is that they’re going to cut costs,” said Tatelbaum. “And it’s still not going to bring people into the store.” Corali Lopez-Castro, partner at Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton, agrees. “This is supposed to be a transformation but I don’t see it because they don’t have enough foot traffic going into their stores,” she said. To be sure, pinpointing where expenses can be shed and figuring out what works is a positive. Both experts believe that a smaller Sears SHLD, +25.63%   might have a chance at turning around the business. But the shrink would have to be dramatic. Tatelbaum used an example from earlier in his 50-year career to illustrate the point: a milliner that became successful after shuttering 38 of its 50 stores. The remaining 12, he said were “viable and very profitable.” 3-D Printed Clothing Coming to a Store Near You?(4:27) A 3-D knit printer developed by Intel is among new technology at the National Retail Federation convention that will help retailers meet customers' immediate needs. Intel's Michelle Tinsley joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero with a printed sweater and a look at other innovations that will improve the retail customer experience. Photo: Intel In its announcement, Sears says it plans to close a previously announced 150 stores during the first quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, Sears Holdings operated 801 Kmart stores and 702 Sears stores, the company said. “On a smaller and slightly different scale, that’s how you emerge with a fresh start,” said Lopez-Castro. “Maybe they’ve identified what works … and now they’re trying to have a newer, smaller, and hopefully more profitable Sears left at the end of the day.” See also: Retailers are expected to suffer big spoke in bond default rate in 2017 Read also: Under Armour’s sole bond issue downgraded to junk status But Sears has been making cuts for a while now, said Christina Boni, vice president, senior analyst at Moody’s. While some opportunity may come from store closures that aren’t “meaningful to the chain,” there’s the broader retail landscape to contend with as well. “The backdrop for department stores still remains extremely challenging,” she said. “It’s always positive to reassess structure, but at some juncture you have to see a stabilization in sales.” Sears said at the top of its release that it had delivered “meaningful improvement in operating performance for the fourth quarter of 2016.” However, it later revealed fourth-quarter sales of $6.1 billion, down from $7.3 billion last year, albeit ahead of the $5.7 billion FactSet consensus. The company said it expects a net loss in the range of $535 million to $635 million, which at the higher end would be wider than the loss of of $580 million posted a year ago. And same-store sales are expected to decline 10.3% in the quarter, down 8% at Kmart and down 12.3% at Sears domestic. The company is expected to announce fourth-quarter results on March 2. Boni said the company had an estimated $1.5 billion in operating losses in 2016. “I don’t think this is anything new,” said Tatelbaum. “They’ve taken everything they’ve said before and stirred it around.” Sears shares are down 51.4% for the past year while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36%  is up 25% for the same period.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema did not immediately rule on a request for a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of President Trump's disputed executive order, but she characterized its language as overly "broad and imprecise." Brinkema's remarks during a packed hearing here come a day after a federal appeals court left in place a separate order that effectively suspends Trump's travel ban. During the hourlong hearing, Brinkema highlighted statements from a group of former top national security officials of both parties who said that they were "unaware of any specific threat" posed by travelers from the designated countries. They also suggested that the administration's order could "undermine the national security of the United States." "I don't have a scintilla of evidence that counters this argument," Brinkema said, directing her remarks to government lawyers.

Asked about the possible implications of Thursday night's separate ruling by a three-judge panel of he U.S. Court of Appeals for 9th Circuit and how the government might respond, Reuveni said "all options are being considered across the spectrum,'' including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the Virginia case, Reuveni contended that state authorities had offered no argument to suggest that immigrants or other travelers were at risk of any immediate harm as a result of the order, indicating that case focused on less than a handful of people. But Virginia Solicitor General Stuart Raphael told Brinkema that there potentially hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand, of students and faculty members already in the United States who would be unable to leave the country because of the order's restraints on re-entering the country. Brinkema, however, focused her questioning on the apparent lack of a specific threat that might validate the president's order. "The courts are begging you to give us information to support this order, and none has been forthcoming,'' Brinkema said, adding that the federal courts have a long engaged in reviews of sensitive information related to national security. Brinkema presided in the 2006 trial of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, a case that featured the review of highly classified information. More recently, she oversaw the case of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling who was convicted in 2015 of leaking classified information to a journalist. On Friday, the judge assailed the language of the Trump administration executive order, saying that "on the surface, it looks legitimate. But when you look behind it, there are all kinds of weaknesses in it.'' Reuveni contended that the president was acting well within broad executive authority extending to immigration matters. The current legal conflict, the government lawyer said, "puts the president in an untenable position.'' At one point, Reuveni made reference to the Obama administration's imposition of travel restrictions placed on visitors from West Africa following the deadly outbreak of Ebola in 2014. At that time, travelers from the affected countries were directed to designated U.S. airports equipped with screening technology. "Give me the evidence of the Ebola outbreak here,'' the judge said. Brinkema said there was no immediate need to rule on the Virginia request because of the action by the appeals court Thursday. In that case, the three-judge panel found that the plaintiffs — the states of Washington and Minnesota —  showed that the ban may violate the due-process rights of foreigners who had valid visas and green cards, as well as those in the country illegally. The judges also said "serious allegations'' about religious discrimination against Muslims raised "significant constitutional questions,'' requiring a full airing in a trial court.

She said about 40 lawsuits were filed around the country in the three days after Trump signed the order to deal with the immediate needs of people who were being detained in U.S. airports and blocked from boarding U.S. flights abroad. Now, Tumlin said lawsuits like the one led by Washington state, which resulted in the nationwide temporary injunction against the order, are being complemented by the lawsuits in Virginia and elsewhere. Her group has also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland challenging the entire order as illegal. “It’s important that courts continue to grapple with the different sections,” she said.

(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) 9155 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 58 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Extolling an alliance more than seven decades old, President Trump on Friday reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the defense of Japan, but he suggested that Japan as well as the U.S. contribute more to military cooperation. "It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger," Trump said after a White House meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. "As time goes by, ultimately, they will be impenetrable," Trump added. With Abe at his side, the new U.S. president said that "we will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many." That includes regional threats from North Korea and Chinese expansion into the South China Sea, the two leaders said. The president, who criticized Japanese trade policies as well as its defense commitment during last year's campaign, also said he would pursue a revamped "trading relationship that is free, fair and reciprocal." For his part, Abe said "Japan will play a greater role" in its defense alliance with the United States, and he pledged Japanese contributions to U.S. infrastructure programs, including high-speed rail. "Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy," the prime minister said. As Abe lavished praise on Trump for his election victory, his status as a political outsider and even his golf game, Trump did not appear to be wearing the earpiece needed to hear the translation of the Japanese leader's remarks. Read more: USA TODAY Trump promises quick action after court ruling on travel ban USA TODAY The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Trump has set aside two days for Abe's visit. After the Oval Office meeting, working lunch and news conference at the White House on Friday, Trump and Abe boarded Air Force One for a trip to the president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. The two leaders are scheduled to play a round of golf on Saturday. The main goal of the Trump-Abe meeting is "building personal trust between the two leaders," said a Japanese statement before the summit, and to bolster the historic U.S.-Japan alliance that is "the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region." Unlike previous presidents, Trump greeted his international guest at the door of the West Wing, a job that used to be done by a protocol officer. Trump extended the same courtesy to his first foreign visitor, British Prime Minister Theresa May. The summit took place less than a month after Trump formally announced he would not pursue ratification of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal in which Japan would have been a key player. Instead, Abe has expressed support for talks about revising bilateral trade agreements between the United States and Japan, and to commit to Japanese investments in the U.S. economy. Saying that "a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations," Abe told reporters after his White House meeting with Trump that "I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this." Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump meet in the Oval Office on Feb. 10, 2017.  (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images) The Abe-Trump meeting took place the morning after the White House announced that Trump had spoken with the leader of another Asia power: China. While Japan and China are at odds on many issues, including possession of disputed islands, Trump said he had "a very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping. "I think we are on the process of getting along very well," Trump said of China, "and I think that we'll also be very much of a benefit to Japan." In his presidential campaign, Trump complained about what he called "one-sided" deals in which the United States supplies troops and general defense assistance to allies but bear a disproportionate share of the costs. Candidate Trump often singled out Japan. Told once that the Japanese pay at least half the costs, Trump said: “Why don’t they pay 100%?" During the news conference with Abe, Trump did not specify how high a percentage of defense costs Japan should pay moving forward, nor did he talk about what kinds of trade concessions he might seek. In Japan, Abe has proposed increased defense spending in the face of critics who cite the demilitarization of the country — and its alliance with the United States — after its defeat in World War II.. Instead, Trump praised the U.S.-Japanese alliance as "the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region" and celebrated his newfound friendship with Abe that began at their meeting in November: "When I greeted him today at the car ... I shook hands but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel." In returning the favor, Abe said "my scores in golf are not up to the level of Donald at all," but Japan's policies are "always aiming for the cup." Closing the news conference, Trump said: "What an honor, what a great honor it is. And let's go to Florida!"

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 12308 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 474 COMMENTEMAILMORE ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A Virginia federal judge offered a blistering critique of the Trump administration's travel ban on Friday, citing a "startling" lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represented a specific national security threat. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema did not immediately rule on a request for a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of President Trump's disputed executive order, but she characterized its language as overly "broad and imprecise." Brinkema's remarks during a packed hearing here come a day after a federal appeals court left in place a separate order that effectively suspends Trump's travel ban. During the hourlong hearing, Brinkema highlighted statements from a group of former top national security officials of both parties who said that they were "unaware of any specific threat" posed by travelers from the designated countries. They also suggested that the administration's order could "undermine the national security of the United States." "I don't have a scintilla of evidence that counters this argument," Brinkema said, directing her remarks to government lawyers. Read more: USA TODAY Trump, in strategy shift, considers new executive order on travel ban USA TODAY President Trump's travel ban: 4 options for what happens next Erez Reuveni, a senior Justice Department counsel, acknowledged that the government had not included such evidence in its presentation but he said Virginia authorities had not offered "proof of actual harm'' to any large class of travelers to support its broad request for an injunction. Asked about the possible implications of Thursday night's separate ruling by a three-judge panel of he U.S. Court of Appeals for 9th Circuit and how the government might respond, Reuveni said "all options are being considered across the spectrum,'' including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the Virginia case, Reuveni contended that state authorities had offered no argument to suggest that immigrants or other travelers were at risk of any immediate harm as a result of the order, indicating that case focused on less than a handful of people. But Virginia Solicitor General Stuart Raphael told Brinkema that there potentially hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand, of students and faculty members already in the United States who would be unable to leave the country because of the order's restraints on re-entering the country. Brinkema, however, focused her questioning on the apparent lack of a specific threat that might validate the president's order. "The courts are begging you to give us information to support this order, and none has been forthcoming,'' Brinkema said, adding that the federal courts have a long engaged in reviews of sensitive information related to national security. Brinkema presided in the 2006 trial of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, a case that featured the review of highly classified information. More recently, she oversaw the case of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling who was convicted in 2015 of leaking classified information to a journalist. On Friday, the judge assailed the language of the Trump administration executive order, saying that "on the surface, it looks legitimate. But when you look behind it, there are all kinds of weaknesses in it.'' Reuveni contended that the president was acting well within broad executive authority extending to immigration matters. The current legal conflict, the government lawyer said, "puts the president in an untenable position.'' At one point, Reuveni made reference to the Obama administration's imposition of travel restrictions placed on visitors from West Africa following the deadly outbreak of Ebola in 2014. At that time, travelers from the affected countries were directed to designated U.S. airports equipped with screening technology. "Give me the evidence of the Ebola outbreak here,'' the judge said. Brinkema said there was no immediate need to rule on the Virginia request because of the action by the appeals court Thursday. In that case, the three-judge panel found that the plaintiffs — the states of Washington and Minnesota —  showed that the ban may violate the due-process rights of foreigners who had valid visas and green cards, as well as those in the country illegally. The judges also said "serious allegations'' about religious discrimination against Muslims raised "significant constitutional questions,'' requiring a full airing in a trial court.

She said about 40 lawsuits were filed around the country in the three days after Trump signed the order to deal with the immediate needs of people who were being detained in U.S. airports and blocked from boarding U.S. flights abroad. Now, Tumlin said lawsuits like the one led by Washington state, which resulted in the nationwide temporary injunction against the order, are being complemented by the lawsuits in Virginia and elsewhere. Her group has also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland challenging the entire order as illegal. “It’s important that courts continue to grapple with the different sections,” she said.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 10, 2017 11:54am   Comments Share: Related INTC 7 Biggest Price Target Changes For Friday Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For February 10, 2017 Nvidia Keeps Delivering (Seeking Alpha) Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) are in the red after cut its full-year margin outlook at its analyst day. But, Michael McConnell of Pacific Crest remains Overweight on the stock, saying the company’s long-term fundamentals are intact. Intel expects its gross margin to decline modestly over the next three years, due to expectations for higher revenue growth in memory, modems and adjacent products. The chip giant also cut its DCG (Data Center Group) operating margin outlook to the low- to mid-40 percent range from prior range of 45 to 50 percent over 2017 to 2021. Overlook Disappointing Outlook: Here's Why McConnell listed out the following four reasons why investors should ignore the disappointing margin outlook: “DCG revenue growth reacceleration from the Purley product cycle should begin in 2H17.” “CCG (Client Computing Group) guidance for a mid-single-digit y/y decline de-risks our model.” “There is optionality on future wireless losses given recent baseband share gains and restructuring initiatives,” ”INTC has an attractive dividend yield of ~2.9 percent.” The DCG margin cut guidance reflects Intel’s move ramp DCG products first on its next process technology rather than at CCG traditionally, and higher expected mix of non-processor sales within DCG, which carry lower margins. However, Intel’s next-generation Purley server platform remains on track for a second quarter 2017 launch. “Additionally, investments in DCG and corresponding growth acceleration in adjacent, non-processor product lines are expected to return DCG to double-digit y/y growth by 2021,” McConnell wrote in a note. Other Highlights Additional takeaways of the analyst day included: Intel’s TAM should grow to $220 billion in 2021. Intel will invest more in DCG and IoT chips. Intel says it has a three-year manufacturing lead over competing foundries. Intel to ship its first 5G modem this year on 14 nm, and expects shipments in the millions in 2018. Intel also expects 14 nm LTE modem shipments in the tens of millions in 2018, which implies retention of share at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) at a minimum. At last check, shares of Intel were down 0.89 percent to $35.15. McConnell has a price target of $43.

Ogg February 10, 2017 9:10 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated marginally higher on Friday morning on what seems to be a very light news day. The Dow is still above 20,000 and the S&P 500 has gone above the 2,300 level. Even though the bull market in nearly eight years old, investors have managed to find new reasons to buy every sell-off. Those same investors are also looking for new and overlooked opportunities. And there is still a path for DJIA 21,422 later in 2017 or in early 2018. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or avoid. Most of the analyst calls with expanded coverage include some color on prices and the consensus analyst price targets are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday, February 10, 2017: Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) was raised to Hold from Sell and the price target was raised to $12 from $10 (versus a $12.38 prior close) at Jefferies. The firm believes the bad news in Ford has been more than dissected in the past six months and is now sufficiently priced into the shares.

(NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $38 from $43 at Canaccord Genuity.

Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and raised its target price to $140 from $125. Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. While most downgrades seen have been on valuation, the Starbucks call from Argus was based on a weaker sales outlook. Shares closed up 1% at $55.81 on Thursday and were indicated down 0.5% at $55.50 on Friday. Starbucks has a 52-week range of $50.84 to $61.64 and a consensus price target of $64.56.

And it was cut to Sell from Hold at Loop Capital and to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup. Twitter has a 52-week range of $13.73 to $25.25. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States JPMorgan Stays Bullish on 5 Red-Hot Semiconductor Stocks By Lee Jackson February 10, 2017 10:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Despite performance that has been absolutely off the charts over the past almost two years, one area of technology that continues to flourish is the semiconductor space, and with good reason. Industry experts say the segment is being pushed along at full speed by rapid growth in the merchant networking silicon and the optical markets. Industry leaders also feel that 100G connectivity speeds will be in full effect this year, while 400G is expected by late 2018 or most likely by 2019. JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur and his outstanding team once again attended the annual Linley Cloud Hardware Conference in California this year. In a new research report, they noted that while challenges always exist within the sector, the path forward is very positive, and many of the companies that the analysts have rated as Overweight look to benefit from the data center market innovation. Here are five companies that really stand out now. Broadcom This stock has been on a roll over the past year and is expected to trade even higher. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. Its extensive product portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial and other. Applications for the company’s products in these end markets include data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems and displays. The company produces radio frequency (RF) front-end for LTE-enabled Apple products. Wall Street estimates that the company does 15% of its total business with Apple. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the RF arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. The analysts are also very positive on the company benefiting on the ramp to both the Tomahawk and the Tomahawk 2 and routing silicon Jericho and Qumran. Facebook is expected to use the company’s Tomahawk switching chip in the Voyager project. The Kalia, Qumran-AX and Qumran-UX families of products are complementary to Broadcom’s high-capacity StrataDNX Jericho and Qumran-MX SoCs. Together they provide the industry’s most comprehensive end-to-end portfolio of switching solutions across the carrier, data center and enterprise markets. Shareholders are paid a 2% dividend. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $230, and the Wall Street consensus target IS 216.23. The shares closed most recently at $205.34. Cavium This stock has been a Wall Street favorite for some time and could be another great addition to tech portfolios. Cavium Inc. (NASDAQ: CAVM) designs, develops and markets semiconductor processors for intelligent and secure networks in the United States and internationally. It offers integrated semiconductor processors for wired and wireless networking, communications, storage, cloud, wireless, security, video and connected home and office applications. The company’s products also include a suite of embedded security protocols that enable unified threat management, secure connectivity, network perimeter protection and deep packet inspection. Arista networks recently announced a new programmable switch, the 7160 Series, which uses the new XPliant XP80 chipset from Cavium. Cavium purchased Xpliant in 2014, and the purchase has paid off handsomely. JPMorgan has a $75 price target for the shares. The posted consensus target is $72.38. The shares closed trading on Thursday at $65.08. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were flat compared to the previous year, as well as revenue that was up 1%. But both the top and bottom lines exceeded the consensus analysts’ estimates posted at Thomson Reuters. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.93% dividend. The $44 JPMorgan price target compares with the consensus target of $40.09. The stock closed Thursday at $35.46 a share. Inphi This company also is a strong contender in the data center arena. Inphi Corp. (NYSE: IPHI) provides high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for the communications, data center and computing markets worldwide. The company’s end-to-end data transport platform delivers high signal integrity at leading-edge data speeds, addressing performance and bandwidth bottlenecks in networks, from fiber to memory. Inphi has solutions to minimize latency in computing environments and enable the roll-out of next-generation communications infrastructure. Many on Wall Street feel that cloud data center customers are more likely to embrace Inphi’s exciting 100G products like the PAM-4 solutions, ColorZ and others. The company is expected to roll out 200G this year and 400G soon after. JPMorgan has set its price target at $59, above the consensus target of $56.21 and the most recent closing share price of $48.71. MACOM Technology This is a company that has been the subject of takeover chatter over the past year. MACOM Technology Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: MTSI) supplies key enabling technologies for the cloud connected apps economy and modern networked battlefield. Recognized for its broad catalog portfolio of technologies and products, MACOM provides high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeter wave and photonic semiconductor products for diverse applications, ranging from high-speed optical, satellite, wired and wireless networks to military and civil radar systems. Many on Wall Street feel the company’s acquisition of Applied Micro was a very solid addition to existing product lines. The analysts noted in the report: MACOM has demonstrated working 100G PAM4 optical links (with the use of MACOM Linear Drivers and TIAs) which would be suitable for 400G in 4x100G configuration. The JPMorgan price target is set a $54. The consensus target is $53.73, and the stock closed Thursday at $45.44 a share.

After years of partisan gridlock in Washington, Trump and congressional Republicans are moving to dismantle Obama-era regulations and some of the biggest legislation of the last eight years, including the Affordable Care Act and the so-called Dodd-Frank law that brought new federal oversight of the financial sector after the 2008 financial crisis. At the same time, Republicans are proposing a raft of their own proposals. Trump, for instance, has promised a $1 trillion plan to rebuild and expand roads and other infrastructure over a decade. House Republicans want to rewrite much of the tax system. “Suddenly, the possibility of an overhaul of the entire tax code is in play versus years ago when the question was: What can you accomplish in a divided government?” said David Schnittger, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John Boehner and now a spokesman for the public-policy practice at Squire Patton Boggs. For companies and interest groups, a unified Republican government in Washington marks a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to advance your agenda,” said Matt Johnson, a top Republican lobbyist at the powerhouse Podesta Group. The frenzied start to the year represents a dramatic turnaround for the lobbying world. In recent years, the slow pace of legislation on Capitol Hill and the economic downtown that followed the financial crisis, helped slow lobbying activity. The number of registered lobbyists fell significantly — from 14,822 lobbyists in 2007 to just 11,143 in 2016, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. “You are going to see spending up this year,” said Paul Miller, a lobbyist who serves as president of the industry’s trade group, the National Institute for Lobbying & Ethics. Miller, whose clients include small businesses and health care and transportation interests, said his “pace has been frenetic” in the first three weeks of the Trump presidency.

In one of the latest examples, Trump on Wednesday pushed out a tweet, slamming Nordstrom for dropping the fashion line of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, raising new questions about his commitment to separate his presidency from his family’s business interests. The real-estate and branding magnate also has positioned himself as deal-maker in chief, willing to directly negotiate with firms, such as Indiana-based Carrier Corp., to boost American workers and products.  On Wednesday, after meeting with Trump at the White House, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the chip maker planned to move ahead with plans to finish a factory in Arizona, adding 3,000 jobs.

If he doesn’t like what you are doing, you may pay for it in a tweet or a public comment in a press conference. Harlan Loeb, who plots crisis communications for companies at PR giant Edelman, said 30% of his calls in the last two weeks have come from clients who are seeking strategies on how to cope with potential administration actions that could endanger their bottom lines. Loeb said the firm is working with companies to game out scenarios should they become the focus of a Trump tweet or executive move. Among the questions clients should ask themselves, he said: Does the administration’s action affect their core business or a key part of their corporate identity, such as a long-standing commitment to addressing climate change? In addition, how do their employees expect the company to respond? The Podesta Group’s Johnson said his firm also is working with corporations to “anticipate where criticism might come from next.” Johnson, whose clients include tech, telecommunications and energy companies, said he has arranged client meetings with Trump officials, whom he described as “receptive and accessible.” He would not disclose clients’ names. “The secret here is taking the open door and walking right in and explaining why what you are doing is good for the American worker and the American people,” Johnson said. “Rather than fearing tweets, let’s get ahead of it and tell our story effectively.” Miller said companies also are learning to push back on Trump, citing the dozens of Silicon Valley companies that banded together to help challenge Trump's immigration ban in court. "They are starting to figure out that 'We don't have to go along to get along here,' " he said.

For instance, the liberal political group VoteVets decided to target Trump’s healthy television-watching appetite. The organization, which objects to moves to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and opposes Trump’s temporary travel ban from several predominantly Muslim countries, began advertising on MSNBC’s Morning Joe this week. On Friday, the group announced it bought time during another show often watched by Trump: Saturday Night Live. The commercial will air in Washington and in the Palm Beach, Fla., market, where Trump is expected to spend the weekend. “We know he’s watching, and we can speak to him directly,” said Jon Soltz, the group’s chairman and an Iraq War veteran. “We have a theory in the military. We always say, ‘Don’t fight the last war.’ Trump is a new battlefield, and you need to fight him in a different way.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

USA TODAY NETWORK President Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 9202 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 200 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump took to social media Friday to continue attacking an appeals court decision against his proposed travel ban from seven Muslim countries. "A disgraceful decision!" Trump tweeted. LAWFARE: "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." A disgraceful decision!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017 Trump cited a law journal article criticizing an aspect of the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the ban would violate the due process rights of travelers without a sufficient national security justification. The author of the Lawfare article Trump cited, Benjamin Wittes, tweeted that the president distorted his argument. You decide whether the POTUS is quoting me in context. Here's the article. For the record, I support the decision: https://t.co/MN3DUZDbXmhttps://t.co/FLagCBkAWr— Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) February 10, 2017 The president did not outline his next step but indicated to reporters he would appeal the decision and continue pursuing the ban. "We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake and it's a very, very serious situation, so we look forward ... to seeing them in court," Trump said right after the ruling.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts By William Booth, The Washington Post Feb 10, 2017 at 8:41 am | Print View JERUSALEM - President Donald Trump warned Israel on Friday that he did not believe that building more homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank was “good for peace” and said he wanted Israel to “act reasonably” as his administration explores paths to broker peace talks. Trump’s comments to an Israeli newspaper, published Friday, appeared as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with advisers to plot strategy for his first face-to-face meeting in the White House with Trump on Wednesday. Israel considers the prime minister’s first official meeting with the American president as vitally important - a way to reset relations after years of feuding and policy clashes with the Obama administration. Since Trump’s inauguration, Israel’s pro-settlement government hoped Trump would give a green light to a building boom in the West Bank on land that Jewish residents believe was promised to them by God and that Palestinians want for a future state. But those expectations might be overly optimistic. In the interview with Israel Hayom - a widely circulated free newspaper owned by Netanyahu’s patron, the Vegas casino magnate and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson - Trump offered new insights into his thinking on the long-running conflict between Israel and Palestinians. Adelson dined at the White House on Thursday night. Trump suggested that he was reviewing his campaign promise to the move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel’s declared capital Jerusalem - a relocation that many Israelis, including the mayor of Jerusalem, thought was a done deal. “I’m thinking about it. I’m learning the issue and we’ll see what happens,” Trump was quoted as saying in the interview, which was conducted in English and translated into Hebrew. “It’s not an easy decision. It’s been discussed for so many years. No one wants to make this decision, and I’m thinking about it seriously.” Former U.S. diplomats, Palestinians and Arab leaders such as King Abdullah II of Jordan have warned Trump the embassy move could stoke religious passions and spark violence, as Muslims rally to defend what they see as a threat against their holy places in the heart of Jerusalem. Trump said he wanted to explore the possibilities for making what he has called “the ultimate deal,” a peace pact between Israel and the Palestinians. He is deploying his son-in-law - and now senior adviser on the Middle East - Jared Kushner to the task. “No deal is a good deal if it isn’t good for all sides,” Trump told the newspaper. “We are currently in a process that has been going on for a long time. Decades. A lot of people think that it can’t be done. And a lot of smart people around me claim that you can’t reach an agreement. I don’t agree. I think we can reach an agreement and that we need to reach an agreement.” In Netanyahu’s government, his right-wing flank, including members of his own Likud party, are now pressing the prime minister to abandon his support for the two-state solution, which he professed in a speech at an Israeli university in 2009. Netanyahu’s tepid support for a Palestinian state has often been questioned by European leaders as well as former Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Netanyahu has wavered on his commitment, once promising voters there would no Palestinian state on his watch and just recently assuring his cabinet he would only support what he called a “state-minus” for the Arabs in the West Bank. In the interview, Trump warned: “I want Israel to act reasonably in the peace process and that it will finally happen after so many years. And maybe there will even be a possibility of a bigger peace than just Israel and the Palestinians. I want both sides to acts reasonably and we have a good chance at that.” Trump appeared to be suggesting that peace talks would involve moderate Arab nations such as Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The 2002 Arab peace initiative, brokered by the Saudis, promise Israel peaceful relations and recognition, in exchange for a full Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Trump appeared to question Netanyahu’s claim that the settlements were not an obstacle to peace. The former New York real estate magnate zeroed in on a key issue: land and location. “There is limited remaining territory,” Trump said of the West Bank. “Every time you take land for a settlement, less territory remains. I’m not someone who believes that advancing settlements is good for peace. But we are examining a number of options.” More than 60 percent of the West Bank is under complete Israeli military and civilian control, where even permissions for Palestinians to add a barn or plow a field must be approved by the military government. The same territory is home to more than 400,000 Jewish settlers living in 125 established communities and another 100 outposts, many of them deemed illegal even under Israeli law. Trump said that he had no interest in criticizing Israel. Netanyahu and his ministers bristled under the barrage of condemnations by Obama and the State Department, which opposed settlement expansion and would issue statements each time a few hundred units were approved for construction. “Israel has a long history of condemnations and difficulties. I don’t want to condemn Israel during my term,” Trump said. “I understand Israel very well and have a lot of appreciation for it. Israelis have gone through very difficult times. I want peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and beyond that I think peace for Israel will be great for Israel, not just good.” Your next Nation & World articles Ford investing $1 billion in start-up New York man accused of bomb plot admits ...

Trump was quick to tweet a response. USA TODAY NETWORK President Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 9202 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 200 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump took to social media Friday to continue attacking an appeals court decision against his proposed travel ban from seven Muslim countries. "A disgraceful decision!" Trump tweeted. LAWFARE: "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." A disgraceful decision!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017 Trump cited a law journal article criticizing an aspect of the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the ban would violate the due process rights of travelers without a sufficient national security justification. The author of the Lawfare article Trump cited, Benjamin Wittes, tweeted that the president distorted his argument. You decide whether the POTUS is quoting me in context. Here's the article. For the record, I support the decision: https://t.co/MN3DUZDbXmhttps://t.co/FLagCBkAWr— Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) February 10, 2017 The president did not outline his next step but indicated to reporters he would appeal the decision and continue pursuing the ban. "We have a situation where the security of our country is at stake and it's a very, very serious situation, so we look forward ... to seeing them in court," Trump said right after the ruling. "We're going to win the case."

OU has gone all-in for the five-star prospect. The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. The center of the Oklahoma recruiting world for the next week is on the hardwood and not the gridiron. Yes, for the first time in a long time, what Sooners fans want more than ever is to land that five-star basketball talent. A realistic five-star talent that could pick OU. Norman (Okla.) North point guard Trae Young, ranked No. 21 in the Scout 100 and a McDonald’s All-American, is set to decide Thursday afternoon between OU, Oklahoma State, Kansas, Texas Tech and Kentucky at the Norman North gym. http://www.scout.com/college/oklahoma/player/192026-trae-young Young has been adamant in the last couple of weeks of saying it’s a three-team race. Dig deeper, though, and it feels like a two-team race between the Sooners and Jayhawks. If you needed more proof neither side is giving in an inch, look at Tuesday night. Just a by-the-numbers regular season game against Moore High, there were two intriguing spectators sitting side-by-side. OU coach Lon Kruger and KU coach Bill Self. It was less than 10 days away from the announcement when the two arrived, it shows the sense of urgency and sense of hope in both to be back at Norman North. For Self, it was a day after a grueling rivalry win at Kansas State on Monday evening. For Kruger, it was taking time off in the midst of a then-five-game losing streak that turned to six with a loss to West Virginia on Wednesday. Young has been as tight-lipped as it gets in terms of naming favorites. What Young has admitted how much of a grind the recruiting process has been for him the last couple of years and especially the last couple of months, last couple of weeks. He’s ready to be done with the process, and the Sooners are banking on keeping the hometown hero in Norman. Speaking to numerous sources, and you understand a couple of things. No. 1, OU coaches Lon Kruger and Chris Crutchfield feel incredibly confident heading into next week. Need evidence? For one thing, there has been zero talk of any 2017 point guard offers in play for the Sooners. OU basketball is not KU. If OU misses out on Young, there is going to be a massive scramble to find a viable point guard. And if they thought for a second that it wasn’t going to happen, should already be knocking on those doors to see what it can turn over. KU can wait this out. The Jayhawks are eyeing another five-star point guard in Trevon Duval. Though at this time, most believe Duval will head to Duke. What if KU turned all of its energy toward Duval if missing out on Young? Could that turn the tide? It’s a tough question to answer, but it’s one you could answer in an emphatic no when it comes to the Sooners. No, Kruger and OU couldn’t simply pick up the pieces and find another Scout 100 prospect that would realistically come to Norman. Sorry. So OU is taking the chance because Young is worth that gamble. Watch Young play, and he has all the tools to be successful at the next level. And is that missing ingredient for the Sooners. Kruger and Crutchfield knew about Young way back when, and if you had to ask them to land Jordan Woodard in 2013 and pass the torch to Trae Young in 2017, they’d take it in a heartbeat. It’s what they wanted. But hard to plan for until you look at OU’s recruiting. Ever since signing Woodard in the 2013 class, it’s easy to point out the way OU has recruited the position. A junior college kid in Dinjiyl Walker. A stop-gap to get from Woodard-to-Young. The first real concern was Payton Pritchard. A Scout 100 prospect for the 2016 class, he originally committed to OU. It was a sign that maybe OU wasn’t going to play the waiting game for Young. It would have been incredibly difficult for OU to be anything more than a token finalist for Young if Pritchard was in Norman. But he’s not. Pritchard elected to stay closer to home and has been sensational for the Ducks as a true freshman. It’s that type of impact OU fans are hoping from Young, of course, if the Sooners are the choice. Instead of Pritchard, OU went the junior college route again with Darrion Strong-Moore and a late add in the high school ranks of Jordan Shepherd. Quality depth, not a deterrent in the Young pursuit. Adding pivotal pieces was key, though. Young can’t be a one-man savior. And if you look at OU’s roster, he wouldn’t have to be. Freshmen Kameron McGusty and Kristian Doolittle are playing like the top recruits they were. McGusty holds the honor of being OU’s highest-ranked recruit under Kruger. We’re seeing why. Then there are the role players of Rashard Odomes, Christian James and Khadeem Lattin. No, they’re not stars. But as they’ve figured out where they can excel, it fits perfectly with Young. Nobody is fighting with Young. They all add to the collective whole instead of a budding competition that could lead to friction. Kansas sources are feeling less and less confident of Young heading to Lawrence. Doesn’t mean he won’t, but despite the incredibly down year for Kruger and the Sooners, OU is still in it. There’s a reason for that. The Sooners have the pieces for the 2017-18 season. All that’s missing is the point guard. That final piece is Trae Young. (Sooners Illustrated will watch Young for the fourth time this season as Norman North plays Edmond Memorial on Friday evening).   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU reloads at RB with SoonerSquad17 TBT: Samaje Perine takes a knee OU signee Robert Barnes on the road back Przybylo podcast: Previewing 2018 #OKPreps Illini add DE Isaiah Gay to 2017 Class Share & Embed Video: Trae Young talks 62-point performance Full Story Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Breaking News Video: Trae Young talks 62-point performanceFive-star point guard Trae Young talks career-high 62-point performance in 103-67 victory. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:52 PM OU hits it big with #BallOutBoyz OU is hoping it struck gold with its #BallOutBoyz for 2017 receiver and tight end class. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:07 AM OU signee Robert Barnes on the road backOU signee Robert Barnes is working hard to get back to 100 percent and talks about the SoonerSquad17 effect. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:59 AM TBT: Samaje Perine takes a kneeThrowback Thursday to when Samaje Perine took a knee instead of scoring in Bedlam. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 10:05 AM OU reloads at RB with SoonerSquad17 OU is replacing a lot at running back, but the Sooners planned ahead for that. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 7:55 AM Chris Robison set tone for SoonerSquad17 Quarterback Chris Robison set the tone from the beginning with SoonerSquad17. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 9:07 AM OU & 2018 Scout300: Scout 300 trends Evaluating where OU stands with 2018 Scout 300 prospects from Scout 201-300. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 7:34 AM Przybylo: The Trae Young ExperienceIs Trae Young worth the hype?

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Samsung Chromebook Pro Review By Hubert Nguyen on 02/10/2017 06:00 PST Launched at CES 2017 during the Samsung press conference, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a 12.3” thin & light laptop that introduces two “firsts” to the Chrome OS world: the ability to run Android Apps acquired via the Google Play store, and handwriting support with a digitizer. These features are powered by an Intel processor and packed into an all-metal chassis. The Samsung Chromebook Pro is the first of a new class of Chrome OS laptops. Let’s see what it can do. Industrial design (very good) The Samsung Chromebook Pro is a clamshell Chrome OS laptop, but you would immediately notice that it has many design elements coming from Samsung’s tablet line of products (itself inspired by phones), including the Galaxy TabPro S, which is a Windows 10 tablet. The round edges and general thinness (display and main body) are very distinctive of the mobile heritage that Samsung likes to bring into the world of PCs. The Chromebook Pro is very agreeable to hold, as there is not a single sharp edge on the device. At 2.38Lbs (1.08 Kg), this is a very light computer that you can carry around with ease and comfort. You back and shoulders will thank you! Multimode Laptop Because it swivels at a complete 360-degree, the Samsung Chromebook Pro can turn into a very nice Chrome OS tablet. The way it is designed makes it feel very natural to hold when in tablet mode. Of course, it is relatively thick when compared to native tablets, but it is thin enough not to feel a bit odd like some laptops do in that mode. As a true Multi-Mode portable, it can also be used in Stand, Tent, Tablet and Laptop modes. In stand mode, the keyboard should be disabled to avoid accidental key-presses. Keyboard and trackpad There are three things that are the foundation to any PC experience: Display, Keyboard, Trackpad. These are the “do not fail” pillars.  The Chromebook Pro keyboard is a full-size one, and has the same layout as defined by Google (no CAPS key, etc…). The travel key is more than 1mm, and it feels very standard. The keys are mostly flat, but comfortable to type on and offer a good grip. The trackpad is about 100x55mm and is comfortable even if we’ve seen larger ones in the industry. Since Chrome OS doesn’t heavily rely on gestures, it’s not a problem at all. The trackpad seems to have a glass surface and is very nice to use. It is also very responsive. Ports The thing with ultra-thin design is that you need to make choices about which ports to embed. There is simply not enough height for a standard USB Type A connector. Instead, there are two USB C connectors (5 Gbps speed), one on either side. Of course, there’s a 3.5mm connector as well, along with a Volume rocker, the Power control, and the integrated stylus. The lack of USB Type A (Standard) can be an issue if you forget your adapter and need to use a USB key, or connect to a printer for some reason. However, finding a cable is not difficult, and if you bump into this problem, it is probably worth getting a handful of cables or adapters to disseminate in your frequent locations and bags. You can get USB-C to USB-A (female) adapter from Aukey for ~$5 a piece Invisible from the outside, this laptop has a TPM module for security, and an accelerometer + gyroscope sensor. Stylus: a first for Chrome OS Yes, you read that right: the Samsung Chromebook Pro has a stylus that fits into the right side of the chassis. it is well-designed and has a “clicky” back which has no real purpose, except to tell you that you have pressed it hard enough to insert/remove it, and it is also fun for those who like to click it with the thumb. The pen’s tip has also been optimized for having a good feel. I do not use the word “natural” because it never feels like a real pen. However, it is not slippery and doesn’t feel weird. It is good enough that you will not think about how the pen feels on the surface. The stylus is large/wide enough to write with reasonable comfort, thanks to the flat design that makes it feel as if it was a (round) pen with a large radius. I do not have any issues with taking notes or drawing schematics over multiple briefings or meetings. Speakers (mild power) Two speakers are located on the bottom side of the laptop. They are decent, but not all that powerful. If you watch movies in a quiet environment (home, closed office), it is perfectly fine, but at my (quiet) desk, I already have the volume set to “maximum” (it was at a maximum on Netflix too). The speaker is ~20 inches from my ears. Display (excellent) Samsung is often synonymous with “excellent displays”, and this time again doesn’t disappoint. The company is offering a high-quality 12.3” high PPI display (2400×1600) that uses what looks like an IPS LCD technology (good colors, wide view angle). Learn more: What is PPI? This screen has a 3:2-inch ratio which is more commonly known in the context of 35mm photos. In any case, the display is more “square” than 16:9 displays which are elongated to match movies. 3:2 has the advantage of being better for anything that uses vertical space, like web pages, email clients, books… most reading-based activities will benefit from a 3:2 ratio. "EXCELLENT"The display delivers rich colors, especially in moderate ambient lighting. The maximum brightness that we measured is 533 NITs, which is excellent and means that you can easily work in a bright environment (outdoors) and scene with high brightness can be reproduced vividly. In a dark room, the black levels (how deep blacks are) could be better – especially against the OLED display of the Galaxy TabPro S, but LCD technology can only go so far on that front. Nevertheless, it is very agreeable to use this Chromebook for video streaming in bed. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? Different applications will react differently to the 3:2 ratio. Netflix simply adds black border at the top and bottom for wider content (no cropping). YouTube does the same. Nothing unexpected here, but some video apps can decide to crop to 4:3 ratio, which is closer to 3:2. In both cases, I recommend using web experience, instead of the Android app. The web version is better and smoother. Since the display has a higher resolution than 1080p (1920×1080), you can use 1440p or even 4K video streaming on Youtube. Both are absolutely beautiful. 1440p at 30FPS is completely fluid/smooth. 4K mostly works, but you can expect some hiccups here and here (I do not think it is my WIFI or Internet since 4K works fine on all other systems). Software: run Android apps! What Chrome OS is and how beneficial it is has been well documented. This Chromebook has every benefit regarding cloud-connectivity, ease of use and security as previous models. However, it is the first commercial product to run Android Apps out of the box, and this is a huge deal. Google started testing its Android container for Chromebooks around the last quarter of 2016. "ALLOWING CHROMEBOOKS TO RUN ANDROID APPS IS AWESOME"Chromebooks have always been extremely simple and secure. However, that security existed because it was not possible to install apps, and offline capabilities were limited. In short, it had great pro and cons. In the past, some tasks that do not have good web implementations were off limit for Chromebooks users. Google worked very hard to remove the friction, and allowing Chromebooks to run Android apps is awesome. This will close the gap between regular PCs and Chromebooks for many applications. Skype, (simple) Video editing… there are a ton of tasks that you would prefer doing with an app. Now, you can. Android apps already run in a container, so they are quite secure. There is also a permission checker that will ask the user for access to resources when needed. While you cannot reproduce everything your Windows/Mac laptop can, Chrome OS has muscled up big time when it comes to app availability. Stylus user experience (good) Out of the box, you can take written notes using Google Keep. This works very well, and the ink speed and responsive is very decent. You can write, and draw. It is even possible to run a character recognition algorithm to extract text (and make search easier) if you want to. Keep in mind that this is running on a low-power CPU. The second option I used is Microsoft’s OneNote, which is very popular as well. In OneNote, the ink is not as fast, but it is still very usable for schematics. Because the ink is slower, writing in rapidly using small characters is not ideal, and you must slow down your note taking. With Google Keep, the ink is fast enough to make small notes writing “OK” – although it could be better. Obviously, a faster computer would have less ink lag, but you would also enter a different category of computers that cost much more. Performance for the price: very good. Let’s be clear, Chromebooks are not about “absolute performance” and winning benchmarks. I will go over the system performance just to give you an idea of what you are dealing with. Opinion: Are benchmarks important? What do they mean? The Samsung Chromebook Pro is powered by an Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor (the same used in the Galaxy TabPro S), so it is optimized for low-power rather than peak performance. There’s 4GB of RAM (LPDDR3), which is more than enough for Chrome OS since it is pretty light (unless you open dozens of web Tabs…). This processor can run Windows 10 decently. There are 32GB of internal storage, and you can add more thanks to a micro SD. Sandisk has a 200GB micro SD for around $70, while Samsung has a 128GB micro SD for ~$45. Chromebooks can be built with many types of processors, but a lot of them come with the same Intel Core m3-6Y30 as this computer. I have seen some that use a Core i3-5005U, which is a little slower. More powerful alternatives can be found with the Core m5-6Y57 and Core m7-6Y75. The m7 is significantly faster (~20-25%) and HP is one of the major OEMs to use it. However, configurations with this CPU cost $800+ more than their m3-6Y30 versions (usually there is 8GB of RAM too). This is a very steep price for this kind of performance jump. At the end of the day, this computer offers very good performance for the price, and that is probably what most people search when they look at it. Battery Life With a battery capacity of 39 Wh, the Samsung Chromebook Pro ($549, 2.38 lbs) is close of the 45Wh of the HP Chromebook 13 ($599+, 2.86 lbs) but the heavier Dell Chromebook 13 (~$640, 3.23 lbs) features a 67 Wh battery. If you compare between those three, Dell sacrifices some portability for a better Wh/Lbs and better Wh/Price. If you have more extreme battery needs, this may be a good option to look at, if you don’t mind the extra weight. As it stands, I found the battery life of this computer to be very good. It can be left for nearly a week without charging. Using it, the battery didn’t plunge, and with my particular usage maybe I would get 6 hours of continuous use which I consider to be very good. Keep in mind that OEMS have battery benchmarks that are often not realistic. Since Chromebooks are heavily reliant on wireless Internet, your battery life would be affected by your network and display brightness conditions. For comparable performance, the battery capacity remains the most potent of all battery indicators. Conclusion: 9/10 At $549, the Samsung Chromebook Pro provides an excellent Chromebook user experience, a terrific design, and a very nice user experience. The ability to run Android apps should extend the reach of Chrome OS to a new group of users who could not do everything they wanted online. Google nailed it with this feature, and we expect it to get even better in the future. Add the sigital stylus to the mix and the Samsung Chromebook Pro makes Chromebook history. "THE SAMSUNG CHROMEBOOK PRO MAKES CHROMEBOOK HISTORY"Price aside, this computer gives very good absolute web performance. Browsing it with feels fast and smooth. Sometimes more so than on a more powerful laptop. Keep in mind that as you open more browser tabs, hardware resources will eventually be scarce. In any case, it is fair to say that it performs better (for web browsing) than a Windows laptop of the same price. It is always important to evaluate if a mix of online and Android apps can get the job done for your specific use case, but if that is the case, you should consider the Samsung Chromebook Pro.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Samsung Chromebook Plus review: future imperfect The best Chrome OS laptop, for now by Dieter Bohn@backlon Feb 10, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin I know the exact moment I fell in love with the Chromebook Plus. I was reading a Kindle book and found a passage I wanted to save. I pulled out the stylus and tapped the "Capture Screen" button on the menu that automatically popped up. Then I tapped "Annotate in Google Keep" and jotted a few notes right on the page, just like I used to do with real books. Then I went back to reading. Later, I wanted to cite that quote but couldn’t remember it exactly. So I opened up Google Keep and did a simple search, which brought up my note (Google had read and indexed it in the cloud). I saw my note and saw the passage circled right there. I just had to tap "Grab Image Text" in Keep and the quote I wanted was immediately right there in the note, ready for me to copy and paste into my Google document. There aren’t a lot of "That’s actually magical" experiences for me in tech anymore, but that was one. And what made it possible was the combination of a Chromebook that could be used as a tablet, a stylus to take notes, Android apps, and a proper desktop browser and keyboard. The rest of my experience using the Chromebook Plus wasn't quite so magical, but it still had its moments. Samsung’s Chromebook Plus is the first of a new generation of Chromebooks running Chrome OS, and it's shipping next week for $449. It’s one of a pair of Chromebooks that Samsung is releasing in the first half of the year. The other is the Chromebook Pro, coming in April and costs $100 more thanks to a more powerful Intel processor. These Chromebooks (and others sure to follow soon) are a big deal because they are in the vanguard of the next phase of Chrome OS, one where it supports Android apps, works better on tablets, and accepts stylus input — all while having a full, desktop-class web browser and web apps. Done well, the combination of those things could take it out of the "couch computer" and education niches the OS currently occupies and make it a more viable competitor to low-end Windows computers. It could maybe even convince some iPad and Mac users to switch. The key phrase in that narrative, of course, is "done well." Conceptually, it all makes sense. In terms of actual execution, Chrome OS has a long way to go down a twisty and treacherous road before it can get to where it wants to be. And when it comes to Android apps, it also seems to have sprained its ankle at the start of the journey. Chromebook Plus & Pro Specs 12.3-inch 2400x1600, 3:2 aspect ratio touchscreen 4GB RAM 32GB Storage, microSD expandable Dual-array mic 720p webcam 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 2 USB Type-C ports Stylus "Island Type" keyboard, no backlight Accelerometer and Gyroscope 11" x 8.7" x .55" 2.4 pounds 39Wh battery, battery life around 8 hours Processors: Plus: OP1 ARM / Pro: Intel Core m3-6y30 Price: Plus $449 / Pro: $549 Taken strictly as a Chromebook, the Plus is relatively expensive, but it justifies almost all of its asking price. The metal body is sturdy, yet light, with a beautiful, high-resolution screen that's capable of getting almost painfully bright. That screen rotates all the way around the back on a couple of reliably firm hinges, so you can set the screen at any angle or turn it around for a tablet mode. It's not an especially beautiful device; it's a little ordinary, in fact. The edges of the keyboard deck and screen are rounded in such a way that when it's closed, it looks like a thin little sandwich. It won't win any design awards, but at least it's simple and predictable. This is a Chromebook, it does not aspire to impress you with its looks. It simply is good at what it is intended to be: a thin, well-built machine for showing you Chrome browser tabs. My biggest complaint is that the keyboard, which is decent enough for typing, isn't backlit. Everything else about the Chromebook Plus (including the price, relative to other Chromebooks) communicates premium aspirations, so the lack of what should be a standard feature grates. The touchpad is also a bit smaller than it ought to be, but it's responsive and accurate. Really, the only other bit of hardware to note is perhaps the most important part: the stylus. It's almost identical to what you'll find on a Galaxy Note, except that this one doesn't have a button on it (and no, you can't put it back in the silo backwards). Google says that the stylus tech in the Chromebook is not exclusive to Samsung, so there's every reason to expect we'll see stylus-equipped Chromebooks (and tablets) from other manufacturers this year. Sticking to the "just use it as a traditional Chromebook" theme, the Chromebook Plus seriously outperformed my expectations. It has an ARM processor in it, which usually bodes ill for a device's ability to handle more than a half-dozen tabs or so. But right now I have nine of them open — some of which are pretty heavy web apps — and I'm not detecting any appreciable slowdown. Performance on ARM Counting maximum tabs before things get hairy is an unofficial way of checking a Chrome OS device's performance, and I'd say the number for the Plus is around 12 or 15. That's a completely respectable number for an ARM device. The processor, if you're wondering, is called the OP1, and though it appears to be made by Rockchip, that branding isn't anywhere near this Chromebook. Apparently it was optimized from the jump for Chrome OS, and it shows. After a fresh boot, I got an Octane 2.0 benchmark score of 9400, which puts the Chromebook Plus ahead of the majority of Chromebooks sold right now. In fact, every Chromebook listed at Chromebook Chart that performs better than this score has a more powerful Intel processor instead of ARM. The other thing to consider is that this ARM processor may do a better job of running most Android apps than the Intel processor on the Chromebook Pro. Those apps need to be translated from ARM code to x86 to run on Intel machines. However, the Android beta on the Chromebook Pro is in such a sorry state that I can't really judge. Google promises that it'll all be fixed by April, when the Pro launches. Right now, the Plus handles Android apps much better than the Pro. Until I tried the Chromebook Plus, I would have told you that it isn't a good idea to spend this much money on an ARM-based Chromebook — and if I'm totally honest I might still have a hangup about doing so now. If you're interested in this device, the biggest question is whether it's worth spending the extra $100 for the Intel processor. Unfortunately, I'm not in a great position to answer that question. Strictly running Chrome, the Pro version is faster and can handle more tabs, but this Plus version performs so much better than I expected that it's not an easy choice. I think for many people, the cheaper Plus will do just fine. I'm pleased with battery life as well. On our looping webpage rundown test, it lasted eight and a half hours. In my real-world use, which involves having a bunch of pretty heavy web apps open at all times and constant browsing, I didn't quite get to eight hours, but I got close (interestingly, the Pro version of this laptop manages to last just a little bit longer). This isn't a battery champion, but it is better for me than, say, recent Mac laptops. There are two USB Type-C ports — you can charge on either side — and you'll need adapters (which don't come in the box) for using external monitors or more traditional USB devices. There's also a microSD card slot for expanded storage if the onboard 32GB isn't enough for you (and it might not be if you download a bunch of Netflix shows). So that's everything that's impressive about the Chromebook Plus. We know what Chromebooks are now, and so it shouldn't be a surprise that a concerted effort from both Samsung and Google created a very good one. But this isn't supposed to just be a "Good Chromebook," it's supposed to be a new generation that's something more than what we've seen before. And unfortunately, those larger ambitions are precisely where Google has run into trouble. The trouble starts with the tablet mode. Google either isn't finished with it yet or just doesn't know what people want to do with tablets yet (I suspect it's both). When you flip the screen around, everything goes full screen, with no option to split windows into sidebars. Want to leave it in tablet mode and put it to sleep? Sorry, Charlie — hitting the power button simply takes you to the lock screen, where you'll have to sit and watch it for 40 seconds before it finally powers down. Given that Google is pushing out Chrome OS updates on a regular and reliable schedule, I expect those smaller issues will get fixed at some point. What I'm less sure about is the consistency and utility of Android apps on Chrome OS. Take the stylus, which is a great idea, but badly implemented right now. Google does a smart thing by having it pop open a menu when you pull it out of its silo, but that's where the current intelligence mostly ends. It's useful for tapping tiny icons when in tablet mode, but there aren't many web apps that work well with it. Instead, most of the apps that the stylus is meant to go with are the Android apps, like Google Keep. In the future, Google Keep will use fancy machine learning to reduce the lag. In the present, trying to take even a basic note is like writing with invisible ink: a letter sometimes doesn't even appear until you're onto the next one. And the root of the problem is that Android apps on Chrome OS are still in beta — a very much unfinished experience. Here's the basics of the situation: in this beta, the Android component is running on the previous version, Marshmallow, instead of the latest version, Nougat. The practical effect of that issue is that you have only a handful of window size choices for Android apps: tablet layout, phone layout, and full screen. None are really what you want — what you want is to just resize them. You won’t be able to until Android apps on Chrome OS exit beta and graduate to Nougat. Living with a bad beta The companion device to the Chromebook Plus is the Chromebook Pro. But it's not coming out until April. We tested it this week to see what the state of Android apps on Chrome OS is really like. The answer: it's not good. At all. Read the full story There are other issues with Android apps. There aren't enough of them that look good or work well on large screens, because the vast majority of them are designed for phones, not tablet or laptops. Google says it's working with developers to fix that, but it's been saying that for five years. Maybe Chrome OS will finally be the spark it needs. But how do they perform? Well, again the story is mixed. On the Chromebook Plus, I found that most apps felt slightly slower than they do on my Google Pixel XL phone. It's certainly passable, but it feels janky when compared to my two-year-old iPad Air 2. I have also had too many Android apps crash or glitch out, and by too many I mean it happens about once a day. It's forgivable in a beta, but still aggravating. The situation on the Plus is miles better than the situation on the Intel-based Chromebook Pro right now, which is so riddled with bugs and issues that I declined reviewing it in favor of this Plus. I describe in more detail the situation in another article, here. All of which is a shame, because there are those "aha" moments of greatness like switching from the Kindle Android app to the Google Keep Android app to a real desktop-class browser all on the same device. Or downloading Netflix shows in the Android app on the same device I use to get Real Work done. Or just simply playing rymdkapsel on a big screen. So how do you judge the Chromebook Plus? Weighed against the standards of Chromebooks like the Acer Chromebook R11 or Dell Chromebook 13, it's a standout device. It's my pick as the best Chromebook you can buy today, so long as you're willing to spend the extra money to get this beautiful screen and quality hardware. It outdoes cheaper devices and will be easier to use and maintain than a comparably priced Windows machine. When you see (and argue) about the score below, that's what I'm looking at. This is simply a great Chromebook when measured against those standards. Weighed against the ambitions of what it aspires to be? The Chromebook Plus clearly comes up short. The software for good Android apps and great stylus support just isn't ready yet. I want an inexpensive, tablet-style device that combines the best of mobile apps with a desktop-class browser. Windows isn't really there, the iPad isn't really there, and the Mac will apparently never be there. But with some fixes to Android and some developer help, this device could be exactly what I want. Google is chasing after exactly the right thing with Chrome OS right now. It just has a lot more running to do.

Samsung took the wraps off two new additions to its Chromebook line at CES 2017 that were built in collaboration with Google: the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus. There are a few special features that make these devices stand out from the crowd, with both not only being the first new Chromebooks to feature support for Android applications via the Google Play Store, but they also include an S-Pen-like stylus. Samsung and Google claim the addition of the stylus will take these laptops to new levels in terms of productivity and multimedia. Will these new features and everything else these devices have to offer be enough for people to reconsider Chromebooks as more than just glorified web browsing machines? Let’s find out, in this comprehensive Samsung Chromebook Pro review! Design We saw quite a few Chromebooks at CES this year, but Samsung’s offerings were some of the most appealing at the show and will definitely be among the more high-end options you’ll be able to get your hands on this year. While this review will focus on the Samsung Chromebook Pro, there is also the Chromebook Plus that is aesthetically and functionally identical. The only difference between the two is the fact that while the Pro features the more powerful Intel Core m3 processor, the Plus comes with an ARM processor instead. In terms of design, the laptop features an all metal build that gives these Chromebooks a very high-end look and feel. Even with its metal construction, the device is extremely light, with a weight of just 2.38 lb, and it is also quite thin, with a thickness of just 13.9 mm. Its light weight, thinness and compact size means that it can easily fit in a backpack or messenger bag without weighing you down. Of course, if you tend to carry your laptop around in your hand, its diminutive size and weight make it that much more comfortable than a normal laptop. Portability is easily one of the best aspects of the Chromebook Pro/Plus. Given the size limitations, it’s understandable that the Chromebook Pro doesn’t have the largest keyboard or trackpad, but Samsung has actually done a pretty decent job with them. The keyboard is still spacious enough to comfortably type on, and the chicklet-style keys have a fair amount of travel. Also, if you look closely, you’ll notice that the keys have a slight curve to them, that helps avoid key mis-strokes by making them better contoured to your fingers. The trackpad also works well for the most part, and while there were no issues with it in particular, I do wish it had “pinch to zoom” functionality. The tactile feedback could also be better, as you don’t really get that satisfying click when you press down on it. Of course, you can use light taps instead, which means that you won’t have to actually press down on the trackpad all that often. Display The Chromebook Pro comes with a 12.3-inch LED screen with a Quad HD resolution of 2400 x 1600. If you are wondering why the resolution seems a little bit different, that is because this display features a 3:2 aspect ratio, which gives you more vertical space to work with in landscape orientation, which is great when doing things like reading web articles, but it also gives you a wider screen when using the device in portrait orientation. Given that this is a Samsung device, it’s no surprise that the display is rich, vibrant, and has great colors. The viewing angles are extremely wide, and the brightness also isn’t an issue if you’re using the laptop outside. The coolest part though is that the display can be rotated a full 360 degrees on its hinge. This lets you prop up the Chromebook Pro in a tent position, which is ideal for watching videos and movies on YouTube, Netflix, and the like, but you can also fold it back completely and use the device like a tablet. Performance As mentioned, the Chromebook Pro is powered by an Intel Core m3 processor backed up by 4 GB of RAM and, as expected, its performance is very smooth. Even with a lot of tabs open, it didn’t show any signs of lag or slowing down, and you won’t have any issues using ChromeOS to its full potential. However, performance does falter a bit when it comes to running Android apps, but that likely has more to do with the integration of the apps themselves rather than a problem with the processing package. Hardware Despite how thin the Chromebook Pro is, it still comes with a decent number of ports. On the left is the headphone and mic jack, a USB Type-C port, and a microSD card slot to let you bolster the 32 GB of built-in storage that is available. On the right side is the power button, the volume rocker and a second USB Type-C port. Both the USB Type-C ports can be used for charging the device, data transfer or to output 4K content to an external monitor or TV. It certainly helps that these ports are available on either side, which lets you choose which is more convenient for charging the Chromebook based on the placement of the wall outlet, and you don’t have to take the device off the charger if you need to use the USB port for something else. On the right side is something that you won’t normally see on a Chromebook, and that is a stylus. The stylus looks exactly like the S-Pen seen with the Samsung Galaxy Note line, with it being the same size and featuring the same tip, and it also into its slot with a click. The only real difference here is that this stylus doesn’t have a button on the side, but it still uses electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology. The stylus adds a lot of functionality to the Chromebook Pro, some of which is similar to what was available with the now recalled Galaxy Note 7. You can use it to capture a specific portion of the screen, take a screenshot, use it as a magnifying glass or even use it as a laser pointer, which lets you move the stylus around the screen without interacting with any of the on-screen content. Of course, you can also draw and write with the stylus, and there is a direct integration with Google Keep to facilitate this. There is built-in optical character recognition (OCR), so any time you write a note, you can have it converted to regular text, or conduct a search for any notes you’ve previously written. While this a convenient feature, it can be quite buggy. The conversion to regular text can be 100% accurate sometimes, but more often than not, it doesn’t recognize all the handwritten text, or it only converts part of what is written. The big question here is whether the stylus actually adds any value to the Chromebook Pro. While the majority of my usage with the stylus has consisted of using it as a surrogate finger, I do think that a stylus makes much more sense on this type of device than it does on a phone. On the few occasions where I needed to jot down something, I was able to write comfortably on the screen and rest my palm on it without worrying about blocking what I was trying to write, courtesy of having more screen real estate to work with. The biggest Achilles’ heel of the Chromebook Pro is the speakers. You will find two speaker grills sitting on the bottom towards the corners. This placement is definitely more intended for using them when the Chromebook is in the tent position for media consumption, since in the regular laptop mode, the speakers are very easy to muffle when placed on a table or when on your lap. Apart from the positioning, the speakers themselves aren’t of the highest quality, don’t get very loud, and can be difficult to hear in a room over any sort of ambient noise. Battery Samsung says that the battery of the Chromebook Pro will last up to 8 hours, but my experience has actually been better than that, ranging anywhere between 8 and 10 hours. The device certainly features enough battery life to comfortably last for a full work day for me. Of course, your mileage may vary. With the exception of editing photos or video, the Chromebook Pro was my primary work machine, with usage that involved responding to emails, communicating with my colleagues on Slack and writing notes or scripts on Google Docs, while also watching videos on YouTube and checking social media pages like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pretty regularly throughout the day. I only had to charge the Chromebook Pro once at night and it was always good to go for an entire day. That is certainly a huge shift from my experience with the Macbook Pro, which usually requires three or four charges every day, depending on what I’m doing. If your usage is even lighter than mine, you could easily push the battery of the Chromebook Pro into a few hours of the next day as well. Software Although the Chromebook Pro and Plus are the first Chromebooks to run Android applications out of the box, this is still a beta feature, which means that the experience isn’t flawless (yet). While social media apps like Facebook and Twitter do work as expected, the experience, especially when scrolling, can be quite choppy. There are quite a few apps and games in particular that fail to even load. The ones that do load don’t run very smoothly, which is more prominent when it comes to graphically-intensive games. Many apps also tend to have issues with properly rotating between the landscape and portrait orientations when trying to use the Chromebook as a tablet. Things will get better with time, but for now don’t expect perfection. Unlike with a phone or tablet, where an app typically takes up the entire screen, I do like the fact that a good majority of Android apps on ChromeOS can run in a minimized or smaller window, without losing out on the experience like you often do on split-screen mobile apps. This not only allows for easier multi-tasking between apps, but also allows the Chromebook to still feel like a regular computer instead of a tablet with a keyboard attached. Android apps on ChromeOS have a lot of promise and the extra functionality in terms of multimedia and productivity that is available by having full access to the Google Play Store is fantastic. However, until it’s out of beta and all the bugs have been ironed out, it is not going to be the showcase that Google and Samsung want it to be. Gallery Pricing and final thoughts The Chromebook Pro will be available later this year, but if you can’t wait for the Pro version, the Plus model can be picked up this month for the price of $449. While the pricing information of the Chromebook Pro isn’t known (although we did hear $549 at CES), it will naturally be more expensive than the Plus, putting them squarely in the upper tier of Chromebooks in terms of price. So there you have it for our in-depth review of the Samsung Chromebook Pro! While the price point is high for a Chromebook, it does have a lot to offer. You get the simplicity of ChromeOS but with an included stylus, a rotating touchscreen, and access to all of Google Play. The Chromebook Pro can be a simple machine when you want it to be, or become a more than capable multimedia and productivity workhorse, and that is the real beauty of this collaboration between Samsung and Google.

Valentina Palladino - Feb 10, 2017 2:00 pm UTC reader comments 60 Share this story Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. The market is about to be flooded with a new wave of Chromebooks, all focused on Android apps. Chrome OS and Android were always meant for different devices, but now OEMs are making Chromebooks that can deliver the best of both worlds. Google's Play Store has already come to some older Chromebooks, but Samsung's new Chromebook Plus and Pro models are the first that explicitly play up their Android compatibility. These devices follow in the footsteps of the Asus Chromebook Flip, which was the first Chrome OS two-in-one back when the operating system didn't really lend itself to that type of hardware design. Now a convertible design is apt to run Chrome OS and Android apps on the same system, but this union of operating systems isn't perfect yet. Look and feel As one of the first Chrome OS devices built with Android apps in mind, Samsung's Chromebook Pro is a true two-in-one rather than a laptop. (We were given a pre-production unit to review, but the hardware design isn't going to change by the time it hits shelves.) The device has an aluminum chassis with a satin finish, rounded edges, and curved corners, making it look almost like two tablets joined together via oval-shaped hinges that let the lid flip backwards to lie flat against the bottom of the chassis. Specs at a glance: Samsung Chromebook Pro Screen 2400×1600 LED touch display at 12.3" OS Chrome OS CPU Intel Core M3-6Y30 RAM 4GB LPDDR3 GPU Intel HD 515 Graphics HDD 32GB eMMC Networking 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 Ports Two USB-C, microSD card reader, combo headphone/mic Size 11.06 × 8.72 × 0.5" (280.8 x 221.6 x 13.9 mm) Weight 2.38 pounds Battery 39Whr Starting price $449 Price as reviewed $549 Other perks included stylus, 720p webcam, accelerometer, gyroscope The Chromebook Pro isn't heavy (it weighs just under 2.5 pounds), but it feels sturdy and can support itself in laptop mode while being toted from room to room by its keyboard deck. The chiclet-style keyboard takes up most of that space, but—refreshingly—this doesn't result in a cramped trackpad. A big reason for the comfortable keyboard deck appears to be the display. Samsung packed a 2400×1600 234 PPI LED touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio onto the Chromebook Pro; the display makes the entire device taller than most 16:9 laptops and two-in-ones. This means a larger palmrest and more space for your hands to sit. Unfortunately, the screen also includes a huge bottom bezel, made larger by a satin-finished strip of hardware needed so the hinges can attach to the lid. You're left with a bunch of empty space that's a mix of glossy and satin black. The edges are rounded and thin, and they contain all of the Chromebook Pro's ports. The left side features a combo headphone and mic jack, one USB Type-C port, and a microSD card reader. The right side has the volume rocker, power button, the other USB Type-C port, and the stylus holder. Both USB Type-C ports support speeds up to 5Gbps, 4K display out (with an optional adaptor), and charging. The pen itself is identical to the stylus used on Samsung's Note pens, but Google explains any EMR pen can work just fine on the touch display. The stylus hides completely when in its holster, the end lying flush to the notebook's edge hardware; to retrieve it, you pop it out with a push. The only things to note on the bottom of the Chromebook Pro are the speaker grills, which are positioned toward the front of the keyboard deck near the corners. This placement doesn't lend itself to perfect sound—when sitting on a table, you'll hear everything clearly, but when placed on your lap or another soft surface, sound gets muffled easily.

Valentina Palladino The display lies nearly flat against the bottom of the device when folded down. Valentina Palladino Keyboard, trackpad, and stylus The keyboard is comfortable, and the keys have decent travel. I only felt cramped by the keys on the left and right sides of the keyboard, as they are the keys that have been shrunk the most to fit onto the smaller chassis. The keyboard is mostly normal (no missing Shift key to mess with your brain), but as with most Chromebooks, the Caps Lock button has been replaced with Google's search button (you can set it to work like a Caps Lock key in the settings if you want). Samsung's included stylus is basically an S-Pen, even if the company won't refer to it as such. It's shorter than a normal stylus (and smaller than a real pen), proving the company could have just plucked some extra S-Pens from its inventory and stuck them into these Chromebooks. But unlike other smart pens, this one doesn't need to be charged, and it will be harder to lose since it slides into the Chromebook just like the S-Pen slides into the Galaxy Note devices. The software that controls the relationship between this stylus and the Chromebook's display is different from that on the S-Pen and the Note devices. Samsung explained that it spent time refining the friction between the pressure-sensitive pen tip and the glass display to create a more realistic-feeling writing experience. The system also uses machine learning so that the display can predict where the pen will land next once you've started writing. This should reduce latency and make the digital writing experience more like writing on traditional paper. The difference made by this technology is subtle but noticeable. The experience writing on the display with the stylus doesn't feel exactly like writing with pen on paper, but it is a more fluid experience than other systems I've used. The latency is reduced slightly, so your strokes will appear on the display almost as soon as you put the stylus to the glass—but there's maybe a millisecond of lag time. That delay can also change depending on the note-taking program you're using, but that is likely not due to the machine itself. For example, latency was similar when I took handwritten notes in both ArtCanvas and another Android app called Squid, but in the Android app version of Evernote (the Chrome Web Store has its own version), there was noticeable lag. I believe this was due to the app's inability to fully adjust to being opened inside Chrome OS, as it would randomly flip the window's perspective to portrait even when I was in landscape, and it performed a bit slower than other apps in general. The stylus' pressure sensitivity is great for digital artwork, and apps like ArtCanvas make the Chromebook Pro feel similar to a Surface Pro. However, I was disappointed that the device couldn't totally differentiate between my hand and the pen tip. Often the side of my hand would rest on the glass when drawing, and I'd end up with an ink spot on my digital canvas. You also can't input handwriting into text boxes, including the Google search bar, using the pen. You can use the pen in place of your finger to tap on the digital keyboard, but you won't be able to write words on the display and have them appear as text in browser text boxes. Keyboard deck. Google Search button. Spacious trackpad. Stylus ready to come out of its holster. Stylus with pressure-sensitive tip and digitizer. Overall, the stylus experience is good even if the pen is shorter than most. As with all digital pens, those who will get the most use of out them are artists and obsessive note-takers. But Samsung and Google did add some extra features to encourage everyone to try the stylus. When you pop the stylus out of its holster, a dedicated menu pops up near the bottom-right side of the display. With it, you can change the input mode of the stylus so that it becomes a capture tool that will save a region of screen on the display, a laser pointer that will produce a small red dot that follows the pen tip around on the display, and a magnifying glass that enlarges any part of the display you tap. That menu also lets you create a new note quickly in Google Keep, but I wish you could change the default location of those notes. I don't use Google Keep, but of course Google wants you to use its services by default and will put shortcuts in place to make that happen.

Rep. Tom Price, 62, an orthopedic surgeon and seven-term Republican from Atlanta, was President Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Price, who opposes abortion and federal funding of Planned Parenthood, is expected to loosen ACA regulations and to work with Congress to overhaul the law. Senators confirmed his nomination by a strictly party-line 52-47 vote after a debate that lasted until nearly 2 a.m. ET. Price's supporters in Congress have touted him as about the most capable person possible to be HHS secretary. As the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, Price "has a thorough understanding of health care policy and the damage that Obamacare has caused," Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement Friday. "He can see the view from the doctor's office as well as from the lawmaker's office and will be an excellent partner as Congress works to rescue Americans trapped in the failing Obamacare system and to build better health care systems," added Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Read more: USA TODAY New stock questions plague HHS nominee Tom Price as confirmation vote nears USA TODAY Fact check: Trump on the ACA and the uninsured USA TODAY HHS nominee Tom Price bought stock, then authored bill benefiting company Democrats view Price as a polarizing figure with a controversial history of trading health care stocks and whose policies will snatch insurance coverage from Americans, many of whom got health coverage for the first time in their lives.  But the law also raised premiums dramatically in many parts of the country, particularly Arizona and North Carolina. These rate hikes hit middle class and wealthier consumers the hardest as they aren't eligible for tax credits and subsidies that reduce out of pocket costs. Insurers are among those looking for regulatory relief. "We will work to ensure a smooth transition to a better, more competitive private marketplace with minimal disruption for our members," Scott Serota, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of America, said in a statement. "We share the goals of making sure people can access the coverage and care they need in a healthcare system that gives consumers the coverage choices they want at a price they can afford, and puts patients at the center of their care.” Republicans are finding repealing and replacing the law has proven more difficult than expected, especially as constituents and interest groups protest the effect a loss of coverage would have. And Price embodies many of those fears. Democrats also worry that he will make changes to Medicare and Medicaid, health programs that assist low-income families. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. arrives with Health and Human Services Secretary-designate, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, for a closed-door GOP strategy session.  (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) Price's positions are particularly threatening to women's health, says Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. "His opposition to contraceptive coverage and abortion care harms women whose access to the full range of reproductive and preventive health services is critical not only to their health and well-being but also to their ability to pursue an education, hold jobs, achieve economic security and function as free and equal members of society, said Ness. Price's preference for limiting women’s access to free birth control is "not only wrong, it’s arrogant," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "He seems to have no higher priority than to terminate health coverage for millions of people,” she added. Republicans see Price as a knowledgeable leader who will help obstruct President Obama’s health care policy that extended insurance coverage for millions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Price "knows more about health care policy than just about anyone.” He said Price would help “bring stability to health care markets that Obamacare has harmed." 15383 CONNECTTWEET 17 LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kVzI4r NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Revenue was in line with forecasts, with the company seeing weaker ad sales but stronger performance in book publishing and digital operations. Expedia — Expedia missed estimates by 20 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.17 per share, although the travel website operator's revenue was slightly above forecasts. Expedia also fell short of analyst forecasts in domestic and international bookings, although hotel room night growth was in line with estimates. Interpublic Group — The ad agency earned an adjusted 75 cents per share for its latest quarter, 8 cents above estimates, while revenue beat analyst forecasts as well. Interpublic's bottom line was boosted by an increase in U.S. ad spending. Pandora — Pandora lost 13 cents per share for its latest quarter, 8 cents less than analysts had anticipated, and the online radio service saw revenue come in above Street forecasts. However, Pandora did see a drop in active listeners compared to a year earlier. Sears Holdings — The retailer said fourth quarter results had shown "meaningful improvement" over a year earlier, and that it had launched a comprehensive restructuring that will streamline its operations and reduce outstanding debt. Intel — The chip maker's stock was downgraded to "hold" from "buy" at Canaccord Genuity. The firm said that while it is impressed with the results delivered by Intel in 2016, it feels the company is caught in the difficult position of deciding between investing in competitive new markets or protecting its more traditional businesses. Fluor Corp. — The engineering firm said it would take a non-cash charge of $45 million or 32 cents per share for its fourth quarter, due to new IRS rules that limit the deductibility of foreign currency translation losses in certain foreign subsidiaries. However, excluding that charge, Fluor expects to report an adjusted profit of 82 cents per share for the quarter, 4 cents above consensus. Fluor will report its official fourth quarter results on February 17. Yelp — Yelp reported an adjusted profit of 27 cents per share for its latest quarter, well above estimates of 3 cents, but the online review site gave a weaker than expected outlook for the current quarter. Activision Blizzard — Activision Blizzard beat estimates by 19 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 92 cents per share, while the video game maker's revenue also came in above forecasts. The company's results were helped by last year's acquisition of "Candy Crush" Maker King Digital, as well as the popularity of its "Overwatch" video game. Nvidia — Nvidia reported quarterly earnings of 99 cents per share, 16 cents above estimates, and the graphics chipmaker's revenue also beat Street forecasts. Nvidia is seeing particular strength in chips for self-driving car systems as well as artificial intelligence. Mead Johnson Nutrition — The baby formula maker will be acquired by British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser for $16.6 billion in cash or $90 per share. The two companies had publicly acknowledged that they were in takeover talks earlier this month. Walt Disney — Disney struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding to buy 90 percent of that entity's Euro Disney shares. Disney swapped its own stock for the Euro Disney shares, increasing its stake in Euro Disney to 85.7 percent from 76.7 percent. Blackstone — Private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone are buying the employee benefits outsourcing business of insurance broker Aon for up to $4.8 billion, including $4.3 billion up front and $500 million in possible future payments. Tesla — Tesla factory workers have contacted the United Auto Workers union for support in forming a union, according to published reports, in what is seen as a protest against mandatory overtime. A Tesla spokesman said the company has been the target of professional union organizing efforts several times in the past.

RadeonSI Performance For Civilization VI On Linux With Mesa 17.1 + 4.10 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 10 February 2017. Page 1 of 5. 39 Comments Since yesterday's release of Civilization VI for Linux, ported by Aspyr Media, we have published a 14-way NVIDIA GPU comparison with this newest high-profile Linux game release. This morning I also shared some Intel Kabylake game figures for Civilization 6 while now the focus is on RadeonSI. For launch-day Aspyr Media only listed NVIDIA graphics as supported via the proprietary Linux driver. However, we heard that AMD Mesa / RadeonSI should work. After finding that Intel Kabylake on Mesa 17.1-dev was rendering correctly for this latest Civilization game, it was less of a surprise to me to find that AMDGPU+RadeonSI was indeed working. With my tests of different Radeon graphics cards, using Ubuntu 16.10 and then upgrading to Mesa 17.1-dev Git and the Linux 4.10 Git, the Civilization VI benchmark mode was working fine... At least in terms of rendering correctly, performance is a different story. I pulled out six AMD Radeon GCN graphics cards for benchmarking against the NVIDIA cards. The AMD hardware for testing was the Radeon R9 270X, R9 285, R7 370, RX 460, RX 480, and R9 Fury. The fourteen different NVIDIA cards from Kepler to Pascal remained there for comparison data points. All of these Civilization VI Linux benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

AMD Ryzen Prices Leaked, Top Version Could Cost About $500 GO Leak claims to show the prices of AMD’s upcoming processors Feb 10, 2017 13:02 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Prices of AMD’s upcoming Ryzen lineup of processors have reportedly leaked earlier today, providing us with a glimpse into how the company plans to position its new chips against Intel’s. In the past, AMD has been quite a fan of aggressively priced chipsets, but if the information that got leaked today is correct, then Ryzen hit the shelves with a higher price tag than the majority of its predecessors. Specifically, the documents that reached the web on reddit via VideoCards reveal what could be the prices of three different Ryzen models, with the top configuration reaching $490. According to this leak, the Ryzen 1700 would cost $316, while the 1700x would be more expensive and come with a price tag of $381. The top-of-the-line 1800X, which will be marketed as a rival to Intel’s Core i7-6900K, will be sold for $490. Ryzen versions While it’s too early to tell if this leak is accurate or not, it appears to come in line with previous reports on Ryzen, also coming through unofficial channels. It is believed that AMD is aiming for three different categories of Ryzen processors, as it follows. First of all, we have the R3 with 4 different versions, namely R3 1100, R3 1100 Pro, R3 1200 Pro, and R3 1200X. All chips in the R3 lineup have 4 cores and 4 threads, with clock speed ranging in between 3.1GHz and 3.4GHz. Then, it’s the R5 series, which comes in two different versions. First up, we have the R5 Pro 1300, R5 1300, R5 Pro 1400, and R5 1400X with 4 cores and 8 threads, clock speeds between 3.2 GHz and 3.5 GHz, and second, there are the R5 Pro 1500, R5 1500, R5 Pro 1600, and R5 1600X, with 6 cores and 12 threads. The top-of-the-line models are included in the R7 series, which groups the R7 Pro 1700, R7 1700, R7 1700X, R7 Pro 1800X, and R7 1800X. All come with 8 cores and 16 threads, with a maximum speed of 3.6 GHz. Full pricing details and a confirmation of whether this lineup of processors is accurate or not will be provided in just a few weeks when AMD takes the wraps of the new chips. Exclusively supported by Windows 10 Ryzen will work exclusively with Windows 10, despite all the rumors spreading across the web lately and indicating that AMD might develop Windows 7 drivers as well. Speculation had it that AMD was planning to develop its own Ryzen drivers for Windows 7, but this information was denied by the company itself, which explained that the new chips would only support Windows 10. This way, AMD comes in line with a decision announced by Microsoft in 2016 and also involving Intel, as the Redmond-based software giant is making Windows 10 (or the latest version of the operating system) mandatory for the newest-generation chipsets.

 Lady Gaga's jump from the top of the Super Bowl stadium was actually an edited illusion Paul Schrodt Feb. 7, 2017, 9:56 AM 86,796 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Lady Gaga seemed to fly seamlessly from the top of NRG Stadium in Houston to a platform below during her stunning Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday. But it turns out the drop from the top of NRG was actually a prerecorded stunt. USA Today spoke to two top people at Intel Drones — which provided the drones in the sky behind Gaga that displayed the US flag and the Pepsi logo — who confirmed that her stunt was done in advance. The Intel sources said the opening jump was filmed ahead of time because of "weather and environment" issues. Basically, if it had rained during the Super Bowl, the roof of the stadium where Gaga was standing would have been closed. While the drones still could have operated, they said, Gaga couldn't have flown down from a closed stadium roof. But Gaga did drop from the top of NRG Stadium in the prerecorded bit and didn't use a stunt double, so we can still be impressed. Clever editing made it appear both at home and on the jumbotrons at the stadium that Gaga's drop from the top of the stadium led directly to her flight on cables in the middle of the stadium. But on Sunday, Gaga started from a lower point, as you can see in this video from TMZ and another video from inside the stadium: Lady Gaga started her live descent at the Super Bowl from a lower point in the stadium. Her jump from the top was prerecorded. TMZ LADY.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Micron’s 3D XPoint-based QuantX memory… Micron’s 3D XPoint-based QuantX memory devices may not arrive until late 2017 By Kevin Parrish — February 6, 2017 5:27 PM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Micon will offer a second option for customers wanting to speed up their systems using memory products using the latest technology, but not until late this year. Intel’s Optane products that rely on 3D XPoint non-volatile memory technology, which was co-developed with Micron, finally made their debut at CES 2017 in January. However, they won’t be the only memory solutions in 2017 to rely on this new technology, as Micron plans to release products of its own under the QuantX brand that will focus on high-end systems and servers. Scott DeBoer, vice president of Micron, made this revelation during an analyst meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, indicating that 3D XPoint technology aims to increase storage capacity while reducing data latency and end-user cost though DIMM modules and solid-state drives. But those products will not be made available for a while, giving Intel a big leap ahead of Micron in regard to market saturation with 3D XPoint-based products. That is because Micron indicated in a recent earnings call that the company would see very little revenue from products based on this technology in fiscal 2017. Instead, Micron expects to see five percent of its revenue in fiscal 2018 stemming from its currently unannounced 3D XPoint-based QuantX devices. More: Intel’s partners already testing memory modules based on its Optane technology During CES 2017, Intel revealed two Optane stick-shaped SSDs that slip into M.2 slots on motherboards. The modules only had 16GB and 32GB capacities, meaning they would be used to provide SSD-like performance in systems that still rely on clunky hard drives. These sticks can also be mounted on a special PCI Express card that is installed in a system like a graphics card. A system with an installed Optane storage device becomes faster because the most-used files are stored in the 3D XPoint memory while all the other data resides on the hard drive. The big deal with 3D XPoint memory is that it is supposedly 1,000 times faster than NAND flash technology and 1,000 times more reliable too. Even more, 3D XPoint is around half the cost of DRAM. 3D XPoint technology is different than standard NAND flash technology in that it stacks memory cells vertically instead of horizontally. It doesn’t rely on transistors but instead consists of a “three-dimensional checkerboard” featuring memory cells that sit at the intersection of rows (word lines) and columns (bit lines). This enables memory cells to be accessed directly, which contain small amounts of data that can be quickly read and written. “Perpendicular conductors connect 128 billion densely packed memory cells,” Micron states. “Each memory cell stores a single bit of data. This compact structure results in high performance and high density.” In a nutshell, Intel and Micron have created memory technology that is fast like system memory (DRAM), has the storage capability of SSDs (non-volatile), and is highly inexpensive. It is a marriage of two memory classes that provides 10 times more storage density than traditional DRAM. It also eliminates the data flow bottleneck created within the CPU/DRAM/storage pathway, speeding up the system. Micron will likely talk more about its QuantX products later in 2017 during Computex and/or CeBIT.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) 11371 CONNECTTWEET 12 LINKEDIN 113 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump promised to drain the special-interest swamp in Washington, but the city’s lobbyists expect boom times ahead as corporate America gears up for a Republican-controlled capital and learns to grapple with a chief executive willing to target individual companies for praise and scorn. After years of partisan gridlock in Washington, Trump and congressional Republicans are moving to dismantle Obama-era regulations and some of the biggest legislation of the last eight years, including the Affordable Care Act and the so-called Dodd-Frank law that brought new federal oversight of the financial sector after the 2008 financial crisis. At the same time, Republicans are proposing a raft of their own proposals. Trump, for instance, has promised a $1 trillion plan to rebuild and expand roads and other infrastructure over a decade. House Republicans want to rewrite much of the tax system. “Suddenly, the possibility of an overhaul of the entire tax code is in play versus years ago when the question was: What can you accomplish in a divided government?” said David Schnittger, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John Boehner and now a spokesman for the public-policy practice at Squire Patton Boggs. For companies and interest groups, a unified Republican government in Washington marks a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to advance your agenda,” said Matt Johnson, a top Republican lobbyist at the powerhouse Podesta Group. The frenzied start to the year represents a dramatic turnaround for the lobbying world. In recent years, the slow pace of legislation on Capitol Hill and the economic downtown that followed the financial crisis, helped slow lobbying activity. The number of registered lobbyists fell significantly — from 14,822 lobbyists in 2007 to just 11,143 in 2016, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. “You are going to see spending up this year,” said Paul Miller, a lobbyist who serves as president of the industry’s trade group, the National Institute for Lobbying & Ethics. Miller, whose clients include small businesses and health care and transportation interests, said his “pace has been frenetic” in the first three weeks of the Trump presidency.

In one of the latest examples, Trump on Wednesday pushed out a tweet, slamming Nordstrom for dropping the fashion line of his daughter, Ivanka Trump, raising new questions about his commitment to separate his presidency from his family’s business interests. The real-estate and branding magnate also has positioned himself as deal-maker in chief, willing to directly negotiate with firms, such as Indiana-based Carrier Corp., to boost American workers and products.  On Wednesday, after meeting with Trump at the White House, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the chip maker planned to move ahead with plans to finish a factory in Arizona, adding 3,000 jobs.

If he doesn’t like what you are doing, you may pay for it in a tweet or a public comment in a press conference. Harlan Loeb, who plots crisis communications for companies at PR giant Edelman, said 30% of his calls in the last two weeks have come from clients who are seeking strategies on how to cope with potential administration actions that could endanger their bottom lines. Loeb said the firm is working with companies to game out scenarios should they become the focus of a Trump tweet or executive move. Among the questions clients should ask themselves, he said: Does the administration’s action affect their core business or a key part of their corporate identity, such as a long-standing commitment to addressing climate change? In addition, how do their employees expect the company to respond? The Podesta Group’s Johnson said his firm also is working with corporations to “anticipate where criticism might come from next.” Johnson, whose clients include tech, telecommunications and energy companies, said he has arranged client meetings with Trump officials, whom he described as “receptive and accessible.” He would not disclose clients’ names. “The secret here is taking the open door and walking right in and explaining why what you are doing is good for the American worker and the American people,” Johnson said. “Rather than fearing tweets, let’s get ahead of it and tell our story effectively.” Miller said companies also are learning to push back on Trump, citing the dozens of Silicon Valley companies that banded together to help challenge Trump's immigration ban in court. "They are starting to figure out that 'We don't have to go along to get along here,' " he said.

For instance, the liberal political group VoteVets decided to target Trump’s healthy television-watching appetite. The organization, which objects to moves to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and opposes Trump’s temporary travel ban from several predominantly Muslim countries, began advertising on MSNBC’s Morning Joe this week. On Friday, the group announced it bought time during another show often watched by Trump: Saturday Night Live. The commercial will air in Washington and in the Palm Beach, Fla., market, where Trump is expected to spend the weekend. “We know he’s watching, and we can speak to him directly,” said Jon Soltz, the group’s chairman and an Iraq War veteran. “We have a theory in the military.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Logitech claims industry first with its new Brio… Logitech claims industry first with its new Brio Ultra HD webcam supporting HDR By Kevin Parrish — February 7, 2017 12:01 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Your face is about to get a lot clearer in video chats with Ultra HD streaming. Logitech is selling its new Brio webcam for the mainstream and enterprise markets. It’s the first Ultra HD webcam to support High Dynamic Range, and focuses on heavy-duty streamers and YouTubers who want viewers to have the best quality possible. It’s also compatible with Windows Hello, making it a great addition to any Windows 10 desktop or laptop system for credential-free logins. First, the Brio webcam’s image sensor (4,096 x 2,160) supports the following resolutions: 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 frames per second (Ultra HD) 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 frames per second (Full HD or 1080p) 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 frames per second (HD or 720p) But there is a catch with streaming video at Ultra HD. The camera will need to be connected to a USB 3.0 port, which transfers data up to five gigabits per second thus making it capable of handling compressed Ultra HD data in real time. Customers also need a desktop or laptop that is based on Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors, which support Ultra HD 10-bit HEVC decoding on the hardware level. That said, Logitech is essentially preparing mainstream and enterprise customers for Ultra HD to become the norm over the next few years. Until then, users may be required to fall back on 1080p streaming given Intel’s latest processors are beginning to saturate the PC market. Current devices typically include one or more USB 3.0 ports, so it is just a matter of waiting for Kaby Lake saturation and a greater number of end users with Ultra HD displays. More: Logitech announces the G203, a new member of Prodigy series of gaming mice The problem Logitech faces with the webcam market is that it holds a 73 percent share. That means the company needs to expand on the webcam design and reach additional markets. This is where the Brio comes in, offering the facial recognition component and HDR imagery. That latter aspect, combined with the company’s proprietary RigtLight 3 technology, provides the best imagery possible no matter the lighting conditions. Logitech also added the ability for users to select a field of view. The 65-degree mode is for face-to-face meetings while the 78-degree mode provides a slightly larger scene. The third 90-degree view is great for streamers and YouTubers who want to include large elements in the background, or add their own using the camera’s background removal feature (currently in beta). Complementing the field-of-view options is the camera’s 5x digital zoom capability. Other key ingredients thrown into Logitech’s new webcam include a detachable USB cable, omnidirectional microphones, a privacy shade, and a flexible mount packed with soft hinges to accommodate various monitor sizes. “With Brio, our goal was to create an elegantly designed, feature-packed webcam that anyone who is the slightest bit serious about video quality will want,” said Logitech’s Video Collaboration General Manager Scott Wharton. Logitech’s new camera is available through two different names, but there is no difference in price, hardware, or feature set.

Rep. Tom Price, 62, an orthopedic surgeon and seven-term Republican from Atlanta, was President Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Price, who opposes abortion and federal funding of Planned Parenthood, is expected to loosen ACA regulations and to work with Congress to overhaul the law. Senators confirmed his nomination by a strictly party-line 52-47 vote after a debate that lasted until nearly 2 a.m. ET. Price's supporters in Congress have touted him as about the most capable person possible to be HHS secretary. As the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, Price "has a thorough understanding of health care policy and the damage that Obamacare has caused," Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement Friday. "He can see the view from the doctor's office as well as from the lawmaker's office and will be an excellent partner as Congress works to rescue Americans trapped in the failing Obamacare system and to build better health care systems," added Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Read more: USA TODAY New stock questions plague HHS nominee Tom Price as confirmation vote nears USA TODAY Fact check: Trump on the ACA and the uninsured USA TODAY HHS nominee Tom Price bought stock, then authored bill benefiting company Democrats view Price as a polarizing figure with a controversial history of trading health care stocks and whose policies will snatch insurance coverage from Americans, many of whom got health coverage for the first time in their lives.  But the law also raised premiums dramatically in many parts of the country, particularly Arizona and North Carolina. These rate hikes hit middle class and wealthier consumers the hardest as they aren't eligible for tax credits and subsidies that reduce out of pocket costs. Insurers are among those looking for regulatory relief. "We will work to ensure a smooth transition to a better, more competitive private marketplace with minimal disruption for our members," Scott Serota, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of America, said in a statement. "We share the goals of making sure people can access the coverage and care they need in a healthcare system that gives consumers the coverage choices they want at a price they can afford, and puts patients at the center of their care.” Republicans are finding repealing and replacing the law has proven more difficult than expected, especially as constituents and interest groups protest the effect a loss of coverage would have. And Price embodies many of those fears. Democrats also worry that he will make changes to Medicare and Medicaid, health programs that assist low-income families. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. arrives with Health and Human Services Secretary-designate, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, for a closed-door GOP strategy session.  (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) Price's positions are particularly threatening to women's health, says Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. "His opposition to contraceptive coverage and abortion care harms women whose access to the full range of reproductive and preventive health services is critical not only to their health and well-being but also to their ability to pursue an education, hold jobs, achieve economic security and function as free and equal members of society, said Ness. Price's preference for limiting women’s access to free birth control is "not only wrong, it’s arrogant," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "He seems to have no higher priority than to terminate health coverage for millions of people,” she added. Republicans see Price as a knowledgeable leader who will help obstruct President Obama’s health care policy that extended insurance coverage for millions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Price "knows more about health care policy than just about anyone.” He said Price would help “bring stability to health care markets that Obamacare has harmed." 15383 CONNECTTWEET 17 LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kVzI4r NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 16 Intel Cannonlake touted to offer >15pc performance improvement by Mark Tyson on 10 February 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadd64 Add to My Vault: At Intel's annual investor day yesterday the company showed a slide claiming greater than 15 per cent performance improvements would be delivered by Cannonlake CPUs. The slide was entitled 'Advancing Moore's Law on 14nm', and you can see it reproduced directly below. Above you can see that Intel reckons Kaby Lake Core i7 CPUs delivered an approximate 15 per cent performance uplift compared to Skylake Core i7 CPUs. When Intel releases its first 10nm CPUs, the 8th generation Core processors (AKA Cannonlake CPUs) we can expect an even better performance uplift at the top end. Intel showed off a Cannonlake powered PC system back at CES 2017, last month. At that time CEO Krzanich announced that "for those who are wondering if Moore's Law is alive, is 10 nanometres going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes." Looking at timescales, the above slide shows Cannonlake's arrival time as being in H2 2017. However, the same slide says that Kaby Lake was delivered in H2 2016, and we know that was a mobile/laptop first release with desktop processors only arriving in Q1 2017. Then Intel will continue to refine its 10nm CPUs until its 7nm facilitiy comes on line in 2020. It's over a year ago since we heard that Cannonlake processors would be the first for the Intel consumer that go beyond quad-core. With AMD Ryzen and its 8C/16T processors due to launch soon, Intel better get a move on. Intel Xeon Processor E7-8894 v4 with 24C/48T On the topic of Intel multi-core processors, yesterday the firm launched a new Xeon with more threads than you can shake a stick at. The pro-targeted Intel Xeon E7-8894 v4 CPU (list price US$8,898) has 24 hyper-threaded Broadwell cores with a base 2.4GHz and turbo 3.4GHz frequencies. Intel has designed these new 165W Xeon chips for servers with up to eight sockets supporting up to 24 terabytes (TB) of memory (or up to 32 sockets via node controller) . Such a system should easily take in-memory analytics and real-time insight processing in its stride.

Posted by Corky34 - Fri 10 Feb 2017 11:16 IDK Skylake to Kaby Lake was a 15% improvement. ;) Posted by Ozaron - Fri 10 Feb 2017 11:21 Corky34 IDK Skylake to Kaby Lake was a 15% improvement. ;) *cough* 1% *cough* Posted by Saracen - Fri 10 Feb 2017 11:28 While part of me thinks “great!”, there's a more subtle part that thinks “15%. So what?” And I wonder if Intel shares a feature in common with most sharks …. keep swimming, or drown. I mean, given that there will be a few exceptions to this, including perhaps gamjng and certainly a few true power-user applications, but for the vast majority I wonder …. just what will 15% increase in performance do for you? Historically, IMHO, the performance race was about one of two things :- 1) Productivity increases in your workload, or 2) Enabling something new to be done that previously wasn't possible, or not at a pragmstic performance. Or both. An early example of 2) might be CAD, where you could get AutoCAD to run, even on 1980's era XT-class machines, but it was so slow as to be useless for all practical purposes. Another example was viable voice recognition and consequent dictation capabilities, where software waited for hardware to catch up. My daily PC life, these days, consists of mainly humdrum stuff, like WP, spreadsheets, email, and so on. Then, I do use Photoshop but even that runs acceptably fast for my needs on a Q6600-era machine with 4GB DDR2 and HD, not SSD. Oh, and as a writer, I use voice-recog extensively, and that machine copes perfectly well. I suspect, for me at least, that a 15% system performance improvement would pretty much amount to my machine going from 90% of cycles in idle, waiting for activity from me, to 92% idle waiting for me, and a 15% CPU gain is highly unlikely to amount to anything like 15% system-wide. I'm interested to know what others, if anyone's excited about this, thinks the real-world actual benefit to their daily PC usage will be? What will it let you do you can't do perfectly well already, or what prodictivity gains will be really noticeable? Or is it just proof, however technically clever, of a shark's steely and grim drive to keep swimming? Posted by kompukare - Fri 10 Feb 2017 11:30 Yes, it would seem that they are on about be the same +15% they claimed for Skylake vs Kaby Lake? Which was more like this: Ah, so Intel's marketing department has 15% = 7.5%. (All due to the increased base frequency and turbo).) Looks like their maths is exactly half of reality? Anyway, I am sure there are some Kaby Lake mobile i7 which in some loads do perform 15% better than their Skylake equivalents most likely 15W models mainly due to not throttling as much. But that is just used be expected from silicon stepping revisions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_level) and that is what Kaby Lake was: a new stepping of Skylake with some new fixed function video decode hardware. Certainly did not deserve a 1000+ numbers: the Haswell Refresh was a lot more honest, and years ago it might have gotten a designation like E2 from B2. Posted by virtuo - Fri 10 Feb 2017 11:50 I do a lot of CPU (and RAM) intensive development work - particularly around encryption/compression and recently emulation. I like to keep my CPU as quick as possible without having to tear down my whole system or getting in to a constant minor upgrade cycle. That way I actually notice the performance bumps and it doesn't cost ridiculous amounts for what is ultimately a hobby. So, as an example I bought in to my 4790K and keep it overclocked and watercooled. It is starting to fall slightly behind newer chips now, even though it tickles 5ghz most of the time, less in summer when ambient temps go up. So 2017 will probably be my next big upgrade, depending on what AMD actually do and how Intel react - especially with affordable extra cores/threads. Being 3 gens behind, I think a 15% performance increase on my current setup is probably achievable. Which to me would be 10% quicker encryption, or 10% more FPS in a software rendered emulation. With overclocking headroom I'd be set for a while. So yes, this is exciting for me, even with the large pinch of salt it has to be taken with.

Thiel has been a cheerleader for Trump since the election.

Absence from the brief became a source of embarrassment, and many new tech firms – including Adobe, Tesla, Zenefits, Postmates and Fitbit – quickly jumped on board. As much as Silicon Valley likes to promote an image of innovative iconoclasm, companies have a herd mentality when it comes to political or social issues. Once one company goes out on a limb, the rest rush to follow. With near-unanimous opposition to Trump’s executive order, tech burnished its image as a bastion of progressive values – a reputation that had taken a major hit when top executives travelled to Trump Tower in December to make nice with the then president-elect. A certain amount of self-congratulation for the industry’s enlightened liberalism has since been widely on display, from Airbnb’s Super Bowl ad to the 10th annual Crunchies, which took place on Monday night. The industry award show – tech’s version of the White House correspondent’s dinner – saw numerous impassioned speeches about Trump and the responsibility of tech companies to change the world for the better. But the tech industry has long had a substantial rightwing streak. And outside of the spotlight, a cadre of powerful and well-connected industry figures with ties to Peter Thiel and some of tech’s most prominent companies are embedding themselves in the Trump administration. thiel web Thiel’s unusual support for Trump’s candidacy made him seem like the loneliest man in Silicon Valley during the 2016 campaign, but like any industry that accumulates massive amounts of capital in the hands of a select few, tech has its fair share of old-school Republicans. Figures like TJ Rodgers, the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and Scott McNealy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, represent an earlier generation of conservative Silicon Valley. Rodgers and McNealy combined the standard small government/low taxes economic conservatism with a strain of social conservatism that is practically verboten in the industry today – both fought back hard, for example, against the first wave of activism calling for the hiring of black and Latino tech workers. Other tech leaders, such as Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Intel’s Craig Barrett, Dell’s Michael Dell and AOL’s Tim Armstrong, have been major donors to the GOP, while HP’s Carly Fiorina and eBay’s Meg Whitman have both run (unsuccessfully) for elected office as Republicans. Intel’s current CEO, Brian Krzanich, appeared at the White House with Trump on Wednesday to announce the construction of a factory that had previously been announced alongside Barack Obama in 2011. Thiel map But none of them embraced Trump’s brand of conservatism the way Thiel did, and now the idiosyncratic billionaire is poised to exert significant influence on the government. Thiel has long operated with a clubhouse mentality. As an undergraduate at Stanford, he co-founded the Stanford Review, a rightwing student newspaper whose writers regularly railed against free condoms and the divestment campaign against apartheid South Africa. Several of Thiel’s closest associates worked for the publication, including Keith Rabois, David O Sacks, Joe Lonsdale, Ken Howery, Stephen Cohen and Eric Jackson. Rabois, Sacks, Lonsdale, Howery and Jackson all joined Thiel at his next major venture – Paypal. He picked up more friends at the company, including Elon Musk, Mark Woolway, and Scott Bannister. Other rightwing associates – including Jim O’Neill, Kevin Harrington, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and Rob Morrow – are connected to the Thiel club through working for his various investment companies: Clarium Capital, Thiel Capital, Mithril Capital Management, Thiel Macro, and Founders Fund. Rob Morrow, who Politico described as Thiel’s “political consigliere”, is a longtime employee of the Thiel investment firms. The Thiel Foundation and Thiel Fellowship, led by Jack Abraham, and Palantir – a data analysis company whose clients include the US intelligence community and defense department – are other meeting grounds for the ideologically like-minded. Lonsdale, Cohen and Howery co-founded Palantir with Thiel; Rabois and Sacks have invested in the company, and Stephens worked there before moving to Founders Fund. To Aaron Ginn of Lincoln Network, a group that promotes libertarianism in the tech industry, many of Thiel’s associates form the core of the conservative movement in Silicon Valley. Ginn named Thiel, Lonsdale, Banister, Masters and Rabois as key leaders in the community, along with Ellison and Andreessen Horowitz’s Ted Ullyat, a former Bush administration figure who later served as general counsel to Facebook. “While overall the Bay Area is of a progressive persuasion, the actual people who work in technology are not,” Ginn said. “According to the polling that we have done, Silicon Valley technologists … are predominantly libertarian, with small government values outside the environment and healthcare.” The Thiel cadre has influence that extends into many of the hottest Silicon Valley companies. Thiel is well known for his position on the board of Facebook, but he and his friends also have reach into companies including Airbnb, Lyft, Reddit, SpaceX, Uber and Zenefits, among others. Now, while the rest of the tech industry turn up their noses at Trump, Thiel is placing his buddies in positions of power. Woolway and Harrington joined the Trump transition team in early December. Lonsdale and Masters were also advising Thiel on the transition, according to Politico, and Abraham expressed interest in joining the administration to the Washington Post. Musk is a member of Trump’s economic advisory council who remained committed to engaging with the administration despite a significant backlash that prompted Uber’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, to drop out. O’Neil has been floated as a possible head of the Food and Drug Administration, where he could bring his enthusiasm for cutting regulation to the agency that ensures drugs like thalidomide are not approved in the US. “Since when has there ever been a VC, let alone a successful tech entrepreneur, who is part of the transition team? This is the first time that has ever happened,” Ginn enthused. “We could have the FDA radically changed. That’s one of the things that Peter Thiel has been focusing on. That would be a huge win for consumers and people in Silicon Valley.” More features Topics Silicon Valley Peter Thiel Donald Trump Trump administration US politics Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Silicon Valley Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 February 2017 by Military News Intel Says Data Will Drive Growth and Innovation Today at an annual meeting for investors, Intel Corporation executives discussed the company’s strategy, key investments and top priorities for 2017. CEO Brian Krzanich said the flood of data being generated by smart, connected things and machines would be a driver of innovation and growth for Intel. Krzanich called data “the most important force in technology.” He said he expects Intel to “play a vital role in transitioning this data into practical and important tools to drive business and innovation.” The number of data-rich markets is large and growing quickly, which is also expanding the addressable market for silicon-based products. More data requires bigger, faster memory as well as new modes of connectivity and more IT spending on devices, data centers and networks. Data is also informing where Intel directs its R&D investments. Krzanich said: “If the market doesn’t generate data, analyze data or use data to drive action, we won’t play in it.” While some data-rich markets are nascent, Intel sees incredible profit potential. Intel has won a leadership position in the established markets for server and PC microprocessors, and these markets (worth an estimated $45 billion combined1) will continue to be significant sources of revenue, profit, scale and IP. That said, the company is setting its sights on a much larger silicon opportunity fueled by the explosion of data. Intel estimates the total addressable market for silicon will grow to $220 billion by 20212. Intel plans to invest in opportunities that build on its strength in PCs and servers, leverage its manufacturing leadership, and benefit from Intel’s scale. During the day, Intel executives shined more light on the biggest expected growth drivers and investment areas. Data Center: Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center business, said the continued rise of cloud computing and network transformation, and the growth of data analytics were the key growth drivers for Intel’s data center business. She explained how Intel was well-positioned for long-term growth thanks to “an unparalleled array of assets” that includes an exciting portfolio of adjacency products, including silicon photonics, Intel Omni-path fabric, FPGAs and a broad portfolio of solutions for artificial intelligence. Memory: Whether on the device or in the cloud, capturing, analyzing and operationalizing more and more data will require bigger memory and faster storage. Intel’s Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) is an adjacent, disruptive growth business with leading-edge technology and manufacturing capabilities. Rob Crooke, who leads Intel’s memory business, explained the advantages of Intel’s 3D NAND SSDs and Intel® Optane™ technologies, which have strong connections to Intel’s core platforms in a fast-growing market segment that the company has participated in since its inception. The Internet of Things: Intel expects growth in its IOT business will outpace the market as the company focuses on vertical segments with multibillion-dollar market potential, including retail, industrial, video and transportation. Doug Davis, who heads Intel’s Automated Driving Group, described fully-autonomous cars of the future as “data centers on wheels,” explaining that their complexity and computing power will require multiple high-end Xeons, high-performance FPGAs, memory, high-bandwidth connectivity and more. Intel’s leading-edge manufacturing capability is another important investment area, and is foundational to the company’s success. Murthy Renduchintala, who leads Intel’s client, IoT and systems architecture groups, told investors that Moore’s Law is alive and well at Intel. “We currently enjoy a three year lead over our competitors’ current process technology generations,” he said. “If the trajectories hold, we will continue to maintain a three year lead in process technology, even after our competitors deliver on their 10-nanometer plan.” New manufacturing process nodes are only part of the story. Renduchintala explained how Intel optimizes its manufacturing process within each technology generation to deliver performance gains with new products on an annual cadence. As Intel invests for growth in an expanding market fueled by data, Intel CFO Bob Swan said the company will take a disciplined approach while delivering on its near-term commitments and placing a high priority on capital returns to shareholders.

Rep. Tom Price, 62, an orthopedic surgeon and seven-term Republican from Atlanta, was President Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Price, who opposes abortion and federal funding of Planned Parenthood, is expected to loosen ACA regulations and to work with Congress to overhaul the law. Senators confirmed his nomination by a strictly party-line 52-47 vote after a debate that lasted until nearly 2 a.m. ET. Price's supporters in Congress have touted him as about the most capable person possible to be HHS secretary. As the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, Price "has a thorough understanding of health care policy and the damage that Obamacare has caused," Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement Friday. "He can see the view from the doctor's office as well as from the lawmaker's office and will be an excellent partner as Congress works to rescue Americans trapped in the failing Obamacare system and to build better health care systems," added Alexander, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Read more: USA TODAY New stock questions plague HHS nominee Tom Price as confirmation vote nears USA TODAY Fact check: Trump on the ACA and the uninsured USA TODAY HHS nominee Tom Price bought stock, then authored bill benefiting company Democrats view Price as a polarizing figure with a controversial history of trading health care stocks and whose policies will snatch insurance coverage from Americans, many of whom got health coverage for the first time in their lives.  But the law also raised premiums dramatically in many parts of the country, particularly Arizona and North Carolina. These rate hikes hit middle class and wealthier consumers the hardest as they aren't eligible for tax credits and subsidies that reduce out of pocket costs. Insurers are among those looking for regulatory relief. "We will work to ensure a smooth transition to a better, more competitive private marketplace with minimal disruption for our members," Scott Serota, CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of America, said in a statement. "We share the goals of making sure people can access the coverage and care they need in a healthcare system that gives consumers the coverage choices they want at a price they can afford, and puts patients at the center of their care.” Republicans are finding repealing and replacing the law has proven more difficult than expected, especially as constituents and interest groups protest the effect a loss of coverage would have. And Price embodies many of those fears. Democrats also worry that he will make changes to Medicare and Medicaid, health programs that assist low-income families. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. arrives with Health and Human Services Secretary-designate, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, for a closed-door GOP strategy session.  (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) Price's positions are particularly threatening to women's health, says Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. "His opposition to contraceptive coverage and abortion care harms women whose access to the full range of reproductive and preventive health services is critical not only to their health and well-being but also to their ability to pursue an education, hold jobs, achieve economic security and function as free and equal members of society, said Ness. Price's preference for limiting women’s access to free birth control is "not only wrong, it’s arrogant," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "He seems to have no higher priority than to terminate health coverage for millions of people,” she added. Republicans see Price as a knowledgeable leader who will help obstruct President Obama’s health care policy that extended insurance coverage for millions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Price "knows more about health care policy than just about anyone.” He said Price would help “bring stability to health care markets that Obamacare has harmed." 15383 CONNECTTWEET 17 LINKEDIN 21 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kVzI4r NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 February 2017 | MYT 1:43 PM Intel uses White House Oval Office for splash on Arizona factory Selling out: Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the "tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward." — Bloomberg WASHINGTON: Intel Corp chose the White House Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a US$7bil (RM31.11bil) investment in a previously shelved Arizona factory, which it said would create 3,000 jobs when it is up and running.  Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement.  Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the "tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward."  Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan 20, promised during his campaign to push companies to keep or create jobs in the United States rather than sending them abroad.  Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations.  The issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives.  The company said in a statement that the plant would be completed in three or four years.  The chip factory was started in 2011 as a US$5bil (RM22.22bil) project that was targeted to open in late 2013. Intel shelved its plans in 2014 when smartphones and tablets cut into demand for chips for personal computers.  Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that was posted on the company's website that the factory would build chips for datacentres and smart devices.  Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11% of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power datacentres and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology You May Be Interested Taiwan Uber drivers protest fine hike as app halts service Apple CEO Cook 'optimistic' about UK's future after Brexit Snap to spend US$1bil on Amazon cloud services In Los Angeles, neighbourhood changed by Snapchat isn’t changing back Pinterest lets phones spy eye-catching items Experiencing painful menses?

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts By Ed O’Keefe and Philip Rucker, the Washington Post Feb 9, 2017 at 8:18 pm | Print View WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he was open to considering a comprehensive immigration reform plan if senators come up with a new one, but he said he opposes a 2013 proposal that passed the U.S. Senate with bipartisan support. The president’s brief comments on the issue came up during a White House lunch meeting with a group of Democratic and Republican senators that also touched on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court and the nation’s opioid epidemic, according to participants. On immigration, Trump said he was open to reviewing details of the 2013 immigration bill written by a bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators, according to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who recounted details of the lunch to reporters. “He’s open to reviewing the piece of legislation,” Manchin said. “He says, ‘Well, you’ve got to start working on it again,’ and I says, ‘Absolutely we will.’ And that was encouraging.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer later clarified that Trump told the senators, “If you guys want to get together to work on a solution, I’m glad to listen.” He said that Trump’s comments on immigration were “not specific to the ‘Gang of Eight,’” and that Trump opposes the 2013 bill. Spicer also said that earlier in the meeting Trump made clear to the senators that he considers the 2013 Gang of Eight bill to be “amnesty.” That version of events is disputed slightly by Manchin. According to the West Virginia Democrat, when Trump noted that there is no current immigration legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill, another senator in attendance, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), mentioned the 2013 bill. Alexander also noted that the 2013 bill had passed with 68 votes, Manchin recalled. “Well, that sounds like something good and you all agreed, 68? What happened to it?” Trump said, according to Manchin. “I’ll tell you exactly what happened, Mr. President,” Manchin said he told Trump. “It went to the House and [Majority Leader] Eric Cantor gets defeated. They’re crying ‘Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty’ and [House Speaker] John Boehner could not bring it back up on the floor and get a vote - that’s exactly what happened.” At that point, Trump said, “I want to see it,” Manchin said. “So he was very anxious to see it. He says, ‘I know what amnesty is.’ And I said, ‘Sir, I don’t think you’re going to find this [is] amnesty at all.’” A spokesman for Alexander said in an email that the senator “thinks it is appropriate to allow the President to characterize his own position. But the Senator did suggest that it is important to fix our immigration system and that the President is in a unique position to help do that.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who also attended the lunch, confirmed that the group “talked a little bit about immigration reform.” “I think he’s looking to try to find some way to broker deals where we can get things done,” Cornyn said of Trump. Several members of the House and Senate in both parties have introduced immigration or border security bills in the opening weeks of the year, but none of them is being reviewed by committees. The 2013 immigration bill carried a $50 billion price tag and would have doubled the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border and required the construction of 700 miles of fencing there. It also would have placed new obligations on employers, who would be required to check the legal status of all job applicants using the government’s E-Verify system. If enacted, the bill would have set millions of eligible immigrants on a 13-year course toward achieving permanent residency status or U.S. citizenship, but it would have required them to pay thousands of dollars in fines and back taxes. Despite broad bipartisan support in the Senate, the measure wallowed for nearly two years in the GOP-controlled House, because - as Manchin said - of Cantor’s surprise defeat in a 2014 Republican primary race. After more than a year of delay, Cantor was preparing in June 2014 to meet with Democratic and Republican members to finalize plans for a House version of the immigration bill when he was defeated by a tea party-backed challenger, now-Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va. Nervous Republicans instantly seized on Cantor’s support for immigration reform as the reason for his defeat. A key Senate sponsor, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had also withdrawn his support for the bill just hours after it was defeated in 2013 - nervous that any association with the bill would spoil his hopes of running for president in 2016. Other issues discussed during the White House lunch included Gorsuch’s nomination, the future of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Export-Import Bank and ideas on how to combat the nation’s prescription drug epidemic, according to Cornyn and Manchin.

The Future Of Android-x86 Is In Question Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 9 February 2017 at 10:00 PM EST. 12 Comments Android-x86 has been an open-source project for the past 7+ years for providing suitable Intel/AMD hardware support for Google's Android operating system. Unfortunately, its project leader may be stepping away. Chih-Wei Huang who co-founded the Android-x86 open-source project in 2009 may be parting ways with it. In February of last year, Android-x86 teamed up with Remix OS' Jide, or more specifically Chih-Wei Huang began working for the company. Jide Technology is the company working on Remix OS as an Android operating systems for PCs and tablets. But it turns out that Chih-Wei Huang left Jide at the end of last year. He wrote today on the Android-x86 list, "I have quit Jide in the end of 2016. Looking for a new job, I'm not sure if I still have time or energy to work for this project in the future. I'm even not sure if it worth to do it." He's not stopping other developers from working on Android-x86 and the license obviously allows so, but so far no one else has stepped up to replace him as the project leader, aside from other logistic difficulties. At Android-x86.org, the 6.0 Marshmallow release remains their newest version available for Intel/AMD hardware. Another alternative for Android Intel x86 hardware support for those interested is Intel's Android-IA initiative that does continue to be refined. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It turns out that Lady Gaga’s awe-inspiring opening number at the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show was entirely pre-recorded. That includes her spellbinding medley renditions of “God Bless America” and “This Land is Your Land,” sung from atop the stadium overlooking Houston’s skyline, and subsequent “jump” off the roof and onto the field below. For Super Bowl viewers at home, the very next thing they saw was Gaga being lowered into the stadium via suspension wires, prior to starting her musical set proper. It was at this point that Lady Gaga’s live Super Bowl halftime performance began in earnest. Inside the arena, football spectators watched the opening segment via the stadium’s large telescreens. During the pre-recorded opener, Lady Gaga stayed motionless while suspended in mid-air by cables that would lower her to the stage.

[Image by Patrick Smith/Getty Images] Another entertaining aspect of Lady Gaga’s high-up halftime number was the multi-colored exposition from the 300 Intel-designed drones that danced in the night sky behind the performer prior to her pretend plunge. Apart from Gaga’s personal safety during the death-defying sequence, this was yet another reason that the opening segment had to be pre-recorded, as uncertain weather conditions and FAA regulations prevented the drones from being deployed above a packed football stadium with a capacity of 72,220. In an interesting reveal from USA Today, the daily newspaper disclosed the planning behind the Lady Gaga Super Bowl halftime performance and its unique, drone-assisted opening number. As described in the report by Natalie Cheung, the general manager behind Intel Drones, Lady Gaga’s intense plummet from the roof of NRG stadium was a feat that simply couldn’t be committed in real time. “From a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” Lady Gaga posing, pregame, before Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium.

New Look Shocks Instagram On Monday, the Washington Post stated that “it wasn’t immediately clear that the stunt had been pre-recorded” to those spectators inside the stadium. The newspaper quoted a lady who had attended the Super Bowl in describing the initial confusion she experienced upon first witnessing Lady Gaga being lowered onto the field after the opening. Per the paper, the lady said that she “could not tell” where the performer was coming from at the outset. “She came into the arena on a harness, but you honestly could not tell where she came from. […] I was with a group of 15 and none of us were quite sure where she actually came from.” Gettin' too funky in the dressing room.

Almost every home appliance and electronic gadget sold today is outfitted with a computer chip, constantly feeding information about their owners back to utilities, manufacturers and other data networks. James Clapper, director of national intelligence, in his annual assessment of threats given before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the government considers this information fair game against people it suspects of terrorism or other crimes. The so-called “Internet of things” is providing a bevy of personal information about Americans, many of whom are completely unaware of the dragnet they are tied into. Smart meters, for instance, measure, in real time, a homeowner’s electricity usage, what appliance or device the usage is coming from, and feed that information to the local utility provider. Many televisions are capable of picking up sound and motion through microphones and motion sensors. Laptop computers have built-in cameras – perfect for spying. Clapper made clear that the many devices increasingly connected to the Internet are providing ample opportunity for intelligence agencies to spy on targets, and possibly the masses. “In the future, intelligence services might use the [Internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,” Clapper told the Senate panel. “Smart Home” devices that exist in major appliances, thermostats, LED light bulbs and security cameras are all targets for spying.

My sources are in the Pentagon, on the scene in the Persian Gulf, in Afghanistan, in Israel, in the CIA, the NSA and, of course, military intelligence.” G2 means intelligence in military jargon, explained Farah.

Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos has been attending regular meetings to check in with ICE officers in order to stay in the country with her family, but on Wednesday when she showed up for an appointment she was detained and later deported. “This is our country because we have spent most of our lives here,” Aarón Rayos said at a press conference after finding out his wife was sent to Mexico. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order prioritizes removal of unauthorized immigrants who have been convicted or charged of a criminal offense. In 2008 Garcia was arrested in a workplace raid at a water park and convicted for criminal impersonation for using a fake Social Security number. She spent three months in the Maricopa County Jail and three months in the Florence Detention Center. She was issued an Order of Supervision (OSUP) and released. For eight years she checked in with immigration officers and was allowed to return to her family in Mesa. According to a statement issued by ICE, García De Rayos was detained this time based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review in 2013. “Relevant databases indicates Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation,” said the statement.

Demonstrators joined her family outside the ICE building in a show of solidarity. “You’re not alone Lupita,” they chanted as they walked alongside her as she entered the facility Wednesday. She hugged her husband and two kids before heading inside for meeting with immigration authorities. As news of her detention spread, dozens of protesters gathered to demand her release. And later protesters tried to stop the van transporting García De Rayos and others from leaving the parking lot. Her husband and two children, a daughter 14, and son 15, caught a glimpse of Rayos de García through the vehicle’s tinted window and tried to talk to her. “It’s going to be OK, have faith,” said Aarón Rayos in attempt to comfort his wife. “Seeing her in the van made me really sad,” said her daughter Jacqueline Rayos. “Nobody should have to pack their mother’s bag to be deported.” Manuel Saldaña, a U.S. military veteran, put his arms around one of the vehicle’s front tires, chanting with protesters, “No one is illegal!” “There are too many people who are at risk right now,” said María Castro, who sat down in the street behind the van. “We need to all come out as a community before they come out after all of us.” The Phoenix Police Department cleared the road and arrested seven protesters, including Saldaña and Castro. Francisca Porchas, director of Puente Human Rights Movement, urged people to call Phoenix ICE Director Albert Carter and U.S. Sen. John McCain to intervene and stop the deportation. “Today is about Guadalupe but it’s also about Arpaio’s racist legacy of terror and persecution of the people of Maricopa County,” she said referring to the former sheriff’s immigration enforcement actions. Thanks to our donors and sponsors for their support of local independent reporting. Join Tom Collier, Robin Hiller, and Gary Mackender and contribute today! Mesa Mayor John Giles sent a letter to Carter requesting García De Rayos be allowed to stay with her family. “I deeply value the contributions to our community that have been made by Guadalupe and her family,” he said in the letter. “People making our community unsafe should be deported. Mothers should be with their children.” Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton also issued a statement about the deported Mesa mother. “What happened last night to Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos is a travesty. She has been peacefully living and working in the Valley for more than two decades, and by all accounts was building a life and contributing to our community. She has now been torn apart from her family,” he said. Garcia De Rayos arrived to the U.S when she was 14 years old. She is the mother of two U.S. citizens. “We are a humble family just like everybody else and we are not a threat,” said Aarón Rayos. “We need to be here for her because as a community we need to support each other,” said Jaime Valdéz, one of the demonstrators outside the ICE building trying to stop the deportation. “Today it’s her but one day it can be me. It can her, him, it can be anybody.” TucsonSentinel.com's original reporting and curation of border and immigration news is generously supported in part by a grant from the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation. - 30 - have your say    Comment on this story There are no comments yet.

I've rounded up the prices, which is where we could expect them to fall when they're announced in the next couple of weeks.   R7 1700: $320 R7 1700X: $399 R7 1800X: $499   Remember that all of these processors are 8C/16 threads, which means they'll offer multi-threaded performance close to what Intel provides for $1000+ with its Core i7-6900K, and gaming performance in the range of the Core i7-6700K/7700K processors.   The R7 1700 is going to be a hugely popular CPU if AMD can price it at $320, as the motherboards for Ryzen should be much cheaper than competing boards with Intel's chipset. Now we just need to have the CPUs released, and in our grubby hands! Recommended for You Intel's new $7 billion facility to make 7nm chips... Core i7-7700K overclocked to 7.2GHz with liquid helium...

Reuters/Joshua Roberts A US federal appeals court ruled against Donald Trump’s travel ban on Thursday. As part of the temporary suspension, people from seven Muslim-majority countries were denied entry to the United States. The decision, made by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, came on the heels of a challenge filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. According to the court, no substantial evidence was presented by the government to back the need of imposing a travel ban. The controversial travel ban came after Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27. The order denied citizens from seven countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – entry into the US for 90 days. Additionally, the order also called for not allowing entry to all refugees for 120 days. Citizens from Syria were banned indefinitely. In a hearing on Tuesday, the government was asked to present evidence highlighting why there was a pressing need to impose a travel ban. The government can take the appeal to the Supreme Court, which can decide whether the travel ban is legally valid. The ruling from the 9th Circuit does not resolve the lawsuit. “To rule on the government’s motion, we must consider several factors, including whether the government has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal, the degree of hardship caused by a stay or its denial, and the public interest in granting or denying a stay,” the court order stated. “We assess those factors in light of the limited evidence put forward by both parties at this very preliminary stage and are mindful that our analysis of the hardships and public interest in this case involves particularly sensitive and weighty concerns on both sides.” The panel that upheld the suspension on Trump’s travel ban consisted of three judges. Two of them were appointed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama and another judge was appointed by former President George W Bush. “It's a political decision," Trump said, speaking with reporters. “This is just a decision that came down, but we're going to win the case.” The administration argued the court did not have authority to assess an executive order signed by the president. “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the court said. “Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the executive order, the government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree, as explained above.” Trump’s travel ban has seen support and opposition alike. On one hand, critics have challenged the value of the ban as a security measure. On the other, national security veterans and officials from law enforcement have shown support towards the temporary suspension.

Even though the competition on the tech market is fierce, there is a name that stands out the most. AMD is the hardware manufacturer that seems to have gotten down the recipe for success when it comes to chipsets. The tech company is actually getting ready to launch its highly anticipated AMD Ryzen lineup of CPUs during the upcoming months. We have some great news for Windows 7 users. AMD Ryzen’s lineup will support Windows 7 specific drivers. This came quite as a surprise since Intel went a totally different route with its Kaby Lake lineup and made them exclusive to HEVC and 10-bit encoding. The reason why tech companies are steering away from Windows 7 is because Microsoft has officially stopped supporting it. Even though Microsoft has been doing its best to get Windows 7 users to switch to its latest operating system, Windows 7 users have been loyal. Microsoft even went to the lengths of offering one year of free upgrades from Windows 7 and Windows 8 to Windows 10. There are many reasons why people don’t want to change their operating system. We can be sure that the most important one is because they aren’t that keen on major changes such as this. Worth mentioning is that Windows 10 is actually really good. In fact, it is substantially better than Windows 7. Nonetheless, PC users that want to upgrade their PCs should be happy to hear that AMD Ryzen is coming their way. Additionally, rumors are pointing out that AMD is going to unveil three CPUs. The first one will have 8-cores, the second one 6-cores and a third one 4-cores. While we can’t know for sure how much money these processors will be cost, we can expect that they will take the market by storm. In the end, we can be glad to hear that huge companies such as AMD are paying close attention to lower customer bases such as Windows 7 users. Overall, AMD is the only that’s going to profit from this move because Windows 7 users are not going to switch their operating system for a processor.

Dewayne Bevil Contact ReporterOrlando Sentinel In the skies behind Lady Gaga at the beginning of her Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday were sights that might be familiar to Disney Springs visitors. Hundreds of drones hovered in the background, forming an American flag above Houston. They are the same model — the Intel Shooting Star — that was used for the “Starbright Holidays” show that was seen nightly over the waterways of Disney Springs from mid-November to early January. The Disney and the Super Bowl shows both used 300 drones for their aerial designs. At Disney World, they made holiday-inspired formations, including a Christmas tree and a dove. That production lasted for about seven minutes. Intel says the Super Bowl performance was the highest the Shooting Star drones have flown. The company got a waiver from the FAA to fly its units at 700 feet. At Disney, the drones reached heights of 400 feet.  All 300 drones can be controlled by one computer and one drone pilot, Intel says. dbevil@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5477 Disney Drone Show 2016 - raw video Raw video of three hundred drones that lit up Walt Disney World in a new Christmas show called "Starbright Holidays."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Report AMD Files A Lawsuit Against LG, Vizio, MediaTek and Sigma Designs For Infringing Its GPU Technology By Usman Pirzada Feb 7, 2017 118Shares Share Tweet Submit It would appear that it is AMD’s turn to try its luck with a massive patent lawsuit against companies for violating its GPU patents. This is something that we have already seen NVIDIA do with its claims of inventing the modern GPU. AMD is now making more or less the same claim against chips used by LG, Vizio, MediaTek and more. Considering the fact that both AMD and NVIDIA have a cross licensing agreement, other companies are the only ones they can actually hunt down for easy cash (with the major exception of Intel). AMD files class action lawsuit for GPU IP infringement; requests ban of LG, Vizio, MediaTek and Sigma Designs products To be more precise, AMD is using patents that entered its intellectual property back when it acquired ATI. Two of the patent infringements filed belong to ATI (prior to acquisition) and only one patent comes directly from AMD. These three patents detail a plethora of GPU related technologies such as GPU architecture, unified shaders and parallel pipeline graphics – all of which are allegedly infringed upon by the aforementioned companies. Advertisement AMD has filed a legal complaint with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) against MediaTek, LG, Sigma Designs and Vizio accusing them of infringing three of its graphics processing patents. The allegedly infringing products are MediaTek’s Helio P10 SoC used by LG in certain smartphone models, and Sigma’s SX7 SoC adopted in Vizio’s advanced TVs. Here is the interesting part however, all of these companies, namely LG, Vizio, MediaTek and Sigma Designs license their GPU tech from ARM and Imagination – none of which are mentioned on the lawsuit. Going for the customers of a design house is something that we have already seen before in the NVIDIA lawsuit, when it went for Samsung’s alleged use of its technologies. The rationale behind it is that it is usually much easier to target the products of an Intellectual Property infringement than the actual IP itself – a shortcoming of the US legal system. The company doesn’t have a lot of cash to spare unlike NVIDIA, so it needs to maximize its chances of winning the case, and has therefore decided to go after the products themselves. It requested the US International Trade Commission to look into the matter. As part of its complaint, AMD has also pointed out that companies like Samsung and GlobalFoundries have licensed the IPs mentioned earlier for its own products. MediaTek has also sued a company filing through the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) responding to allegations by AMD of infringing its graphics processing patents. MediaTek said the case has entered judicial processes in the US. It added that based on the currently available information, “this litigation matter has not had any material impact on the company’s operations”. This is of course a premature statement that implies the company is confident it will win the lawsuit, because if it loses the case, it could be facing a temporary ban on the use of its products or rather a fairly large chunk of cash as settlement.

The great news for you as an investor is that there is a pure play on all of this: the chip company Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) based in Santa Clara, Calif. “We think Nvidia will grow very rapidly through 2019 and beyond.” — Brian Beitner, manager of the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund OK, this sounds like a bunch of malarkey. Is it just more “fake news”? Believe it or not, most of it is actually true. Yes, the part about Element Zero on Mars is fake. That comes from the plot line in a much-anticipated Electronic Arts (EA) video game called “Mass Effect: Andromeda.” It’s the fourth part of a popular franchise due March 21. (Three for March, and then two, one, lift-off. Get it?) But the following is true, and it explains how we get from a fake element on Mars to breakthroughs in medical research and self-driving cars in three easy steps. First, “Mass Effect” will be a big hit. Along with other popular games, it’s going to draw even more players to video gaming and “e-sports.” This will make fans want to upgrade their PCs for better performance. Step two: This will increase demand for some of the most powerful chips on the planet made by Nvidia — the GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPU). They’re the chips that make PC-based gaming so real. Third, Nvidia will use a lot of the money it earns to keep improving its chips. Then researchers in drug development, artificial intelligence, autonomous cars and robotics will continue to use these advanced chips to make breakthroughs of their own. This feedback loop is powerful, and it tells me that Nvidia’s robust third-quarter sales strength will most likely follow through in fourth-quarter earnings to be reported Thursday. Read:Nvidia earnings: Can the hottest stock of 2016 find another gear? Regardless of what Nvidia reports this week, if you buy the stock now as a play on these themes, you are probably going to do just fine, even though the stock looks a little scary after its 244% advance last year. Brian Beitner, who manages the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund (CCGIX) is one stock picker who isn’t too bothered by that increase, or Nvidia’s rich valuation. Nvidia stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 44. Beitner thinks the trends behind Nvidia’s growth are so strong, it will simply grow into its valuation over time. A drone tour of China's rusting shipyards “We think the company will grow very rapidly through 2019 and beyond,” says Beitner. “We envision robust growth relative to the rest of the market.” That’s one of the main reasons his fund recently added the stock. Beitner is worth listening to, because he’s the rare active manager who beats the market. His fund outperformed its benchmark by about 3 percentage points, annualized, over the past 10 years. Indeed, using the old Peter Lynch price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) metric, Nvidia’s valuation looks OK. Lynch’s PEG ratio divides a company’s P/E by its estimated growth rate. Lynch, who made a name for himself by crushing the stock market at Fidelity Investments, considered anything at or below 1.5 for a fast-growing company like Nvidia to be a reasonable valuation. Nvidia’s PEG ratio is around 1.5. Here’s another false fear about Nvidia that you should probably ignore, says Jefferies chip-sector analyst Mark Lipacis. Yes, the chip sector looks vulnerable. Chip stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced 37% last year compared with 10% for the S&P 500 (SPX) A “reversion to the mean” now might be natural. Chip inventories may be rising because chip suppliers are selling more chips than equipment makers are sending out the door inside finished products. That can be ominous for the group. Debt levels are high at chip makers in general, which limits potential gains from leverage. And the mergers-and-acquisitions trend in the industry may have played out. Despite these potentially negative trends, which make Lipacis cautious on the group, he still likes Nvidia. He thinks it is among a handful of chip stocks that might be exempt from any sector issues. Beitner agrees, citing the company’s competitive advantages and “big, open-ended growth opportunities.” Here’s a closer look at the main opportunities. The revenge of the gamers Thanks to popular games like “Mass Effect,” “Call of Duty,” “Grand Theft Auto” and “Minecraft,” video gaming is now the largest entertainment business in the world. It takes in about $75 billion a year. Sales should grow 5% a year through 2020, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Gaming isn’t just about playing. It’s also a spectator sport. Many top YouTube channels show gamers in action. Other gamers like to watch to learn new skills. All of this means that a chip company that sells into this trend might be immune from the normal semiconductor cycles. “Video gaming is one of the most interesting trends happening in discretionary consumer spending,” says Jesse Flores, an analyst at the Chautauqua fund. “There is a lot of money being spent on this, and the number of video gamers is growing in the double digits [in percentage terms].” Gamers prefer customized personal computers, as opposed to consoles like the Xbox, and Nividia plays right into this trend since its GeForce line of GPUs powers gaming PCs. “Nvidia has captured this trend incredibly well. Nvidia is, for all intents and purposes, the category killer,” says Flores. “They have 80% share for discrete graphics processors for PC video gaming.” Discrete processors are chips dedicated to a single use — like graphics, in this case. Nvidia has a competitive advantage in GPUs because it has been in the video-graphics business for nearly three decades, and it spends a lot on research. Along the way, it has even created its own programming language, called Cuda, to help researchers develop GPUs. One sign of Nvidia’s strength is that Intel (INTC) has tried for decades to break in to the space, with little success. “If it is challenging for Intel, you know the barriers are very, very high,” says Beitner. Third-quarter sales at Nvidia advanced 54% to $2 billion compared to the prior year, and most of that came from GeForce gaming GPU sales growth. As usual, Nvidia redeployed a lot of that money to making its chips better. Research-and-development spending advanced 13% in the quarter to $373 million, or about $1.5 billion annualized. Since its inception in 1993, the company has invested over $12 billion in research. But it’s also generous to shareholders. It expects to spend $1 billion for share buybacks and dividends in 2017. In short, for years gamers have been funding the development of chips that now power real-life advances in medical research, self-driving cars, robotics and big-data analytics. This handoff is a huge potential source of growth for Nvidia. And it helps all of us because of the advances supported by these high-powered chips. Call it the revenge of the gamers, who are often criticized for being slackers. Let’s take a closer look at the developments that gamers have been supporting.  Deep learning and artificial intelligence Because Nvidia chips are so good at parallel processing, they are increasingly popular outside of gaming. A key here is the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI). “AI researchers met the GPU that we invented, and the big bang of AI happened,” Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang proclaimed in the keynote speech at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. Take cars, for example. Nvidia chips are already slated to power the new autopilot system in all Tesla Motors (TSLA) cars. But the real breakthroughs in self-driving cars won’t happen until AI becomes more advanced, says Huang, something he expects to happen over the next five years. “It’s not just about detecting objects. It’s about reasoning,” he says. Reasoning about what to do, and continuous learning to support that reasoning. “These are artificial-intelligence problems,” he says. All of this calls for a lot of computing power, and Nvidia chips will play a big role in this, Huang predicts. You see the same computing-power challenges in areas like database analytics and “deep learning,” which means computers are learning skills on their own so they are better able to recognize images and speech, carry out search and make recommendations to consumers based on their behavior. This is why companies like Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG) Facebook (FB) and others in database analytics use Nvidia chips to get the job done, says Peter Karazeris, a tech sector analyst at Thrivent Financial. This side of the business is a huge growth opportunity for Nvidia. “The GPU has really reached a tipping point,” says Huang. “GPU is no longer a niche component. The size of the marketplace that we’re addressing is really larger than any time in our history.” Data-center revenue grew 193% in the third quarter to $240 million, and you can expect a lot more to come. “We are in the early innings of a significant change in the computing paradigm for data centers,” says Flores, the analyst at the Chautauqua fund. “Parallel processing is going to be one of the most important features that drives cloud computing and AI growth. Nvidia is in the unique position to address this market because of its heritage as a graphics-processing company.” Flores thinks this could be a multi-billion dollar business for Nvidia in a few years. Like gaming, this business may also help protect Nvidia from the vagaries of the chip cycle. “The new apps used in AI and data centers won’t run on the chip cycle,” says Karazeris, at Thrivent Financial. “This is a different set of customers.” So while Element Zero on Mars may only be a made-up gamer fantasy, fantasies like these help explain why Nvidia’s rapid growth and independence from the chip cycle should continue to be all too real. Those fantasies may also be part of the reason why you’ll be sitting in a self-driving car five or 10 years from now.

Here's what the company will highlight at RSA next week. By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | February 10, 2017 -- 18:05 GMT (10:05 PST) | Topic: Security Microsoft is continuing to beef up its security offerings across Windows 10, SQL Server, Office, and Azure and is using next week's RSA conference to highlight its latest incremental updates. Windows Hello, Microsoft's authentication service meant to replace passwords, already works with Azure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory Connect. With the Windows 10 Creators Update, users also will be able to use Windows Hello in on-premises Active-Directory-only environments, Microsoft officials said on Feb. 10. Microsoft and Intel also are working together on integrating Hello with Intel's Authenticate technology. Windows devices that support this hardware-based authentication and integration will be available by the end of 2017, officials said. (This is part of the Intel Project EVO work.) Other Microsoft RSA announcements: Windows 10 and Surface Pro 3, Pro 4 and Surface Book have been added to the NSA's Commercial Solutions for Classified Programs (CsfC) list, meaning they're approved for classified use. Microsoft is adding a new layer of hardware security support to Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and Surface Studio via a new Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM) option. This lets users do things like disable cameras or turn off microphones for devices used in certain classified and secure areas. More incremental security-focused updates are coming to Windows 10 with the Creators Update, as officials said late last year, including the addition of security settings and configurations previously available only through Group Policy to mobile device management products. Creators Update users also will get the ability to add customized detection rules and policies through Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. Creators Update is expected to start rolling out in April 2017. Microsoft is planning to add more security features to Office 365. A new security analytics tool called Office 365 Secure Score, is generally available to Office 365 commercial customers and those in multi-tenant and Office 365 US Government Clouds. Office 365 Threat Intelligence (in preview, with general availability for Office 365 E5 users in March) for detecting potential cyber threats; and Office 365 Advanced Data Governance (in preview, with availability slated for later this quarter for Office 365 E5 users). Azure SQL Database Threat Detection, with proactive monitoring and alerting of suspicious database activity and vulnerabilities, will be generally available in April 2017. special feature Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness.

Peter Bright - Feb 10, 2017 6:20 pm UTC Enlarge / No longer do these ports need to be defiled with glue. Casey Johnston reader comments 48 Share this story Windows 10 and Surface hardware are now good enough for government work, even when dealing with classified data. The operating system and the Surface Pro 3 and 4, Surface Book, and Surface Studio have all been added to the NSA's Commercial Solutions for Classified Programs (CSfC) list. This means that, when properly configured and used in a properly designed layered deployment, the hardware and software all provide adequate security for classified data. To further increase the appeal of the Surface in constrained enterprise environments, today Microsoft is announcing Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM) for Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and Surface Studio. SEMM enables administrators with physical access to the hardware to lock out integrated peripherals such as webcam, microphone, and USB ports. This locking out is done by the firmware, disabling the devices in question, rendering them wholly inaccessible to the operating system. It's intended as a much more elegant alternative to supergluing the ports or drilling out the cameras. SEMM is designed to allow not just static configuration, wherein the devices are disabled permanently, but also dynamic configuration that responds to the environment. For example, a SEMM system could be configured so that when it was on a classified network the USB ports and camera were disabled, but when on an open network they were re-enabled. The system uses digital signatures and certificates to manage the configurations, preventing end users from re-enabling devices that they shouldn't have access to. When they can, companies might want to leave those webcams enabled, however. Windows Hello biometric authentication currently requires systems to have some element of cloud connectivity. For home users, this means using a Microsoft account. For enterprise users, this means either pairing the domain account with a Microsoft account or using Azure Active Directory. Companies that were unwilling to use Microsoft accounts or unable to federate their local Active Directory with Azure were left out. The Windows 10 Creators Update changes that; it enables Windows Hello for any Active Directory organization, even if it's fully on-premises. This means that facial recognition using suitable webcams—including the ones found in the Surface—is available to many more enterprise users. Later in the year, Microsoft will integrate Windows Hello with Intel Authenticate, a hardware-based authentication system that's part of Intel's vPro platform. Windows systems currently have two broad sets of management tools: there's the Group Policy system, which remains the most capable farther-reaching setting and configuration tool, and there's also a range of settings that can be controlled by Mobile Device Management (MDM) software. The Creators Update is going to expand the number of settings that MDM can configure to include many of those in the Security Baseline Policies, and the MDM Migration Analytics Tool will help replicate policy settings so that they can be applied to MDM-controlled devices. Microsoft has described already improvements that the Creators Update is bringing to Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP), and one more piece of data is now coming soon. WDATP users have told Microsoft that they want to gather all security-related reporting in a single place, and so WDATP is going to include reports from anti-malware software, starting with Windows Defender. The cloud-based Windows Analytics service is also being enhanced to show uptake rates of Windows 10 security and feature updates. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

A case in point: If government services and infrastructure were awarded to low-population areas in proportion to the income they produce, large swaths of America wouldn't have paved roads, bridges or anything but one-room schools. Basic politic principles and simple fairness would never allow such overt neglect in the U.S. When it comes to the Oregon Department of Transportation, however, a valid argument definitely can be made for a somewhat more businesslike approach to such fundamental procedures as setting priorities, seeking out differing opinions and measuring how well goals are being achieved. With a budget of roughly $2 billion a year and thousands of employees, ODOT is one of the state's largest organizations. It's no Nike or Intel, but it's big enough — and so crucial to the state's safety and success — that it must adopt at least some lessons from the private corporate world in order to achieve all it needs to do with the resources it has available. It wants even more. ODOT, along with Oregon's counties and cities, suggests they might need up to an extra $5 billion a year to preserve roads and bridges, ease congestion and bolster public transportation. A nearly $1 million performance audit from New York-based McKinsey & Co. — which the EO Media Group/Pamplin Media Group Capital Bureau successfully pressed ODOT to release last month — found the department acts like a complacent family. Nobody in top management rocks the boat by questioning the agency's decisions. Though the audit is couched in the diplomatic code phrases of managerial consultants, the overall picture of top ODOT management is uncomfortably close to the old cliché of a clubby circle of friends standing around leaning on their shovels kibitzing. Consultant interviews with senior management found "no example of individuals who considered themselves a 'dissenting voice.'" Government agencies, boards and commissions often go to great effort to ensure such a lack of disagreement within their ranks. However, from a public perspective, too many unanimous decisions within an entity like ODOT are nearly always a sign of trouble. It means no one is really speaking up to question old assumptions or fight for significant changes in budgeting, personnel, project planning and other important matters. In the case of Oregon's transportation system, ODOT's management team is supposed to be accountable to the five-member governor-appointed Oregon Transportation Commission. However, this effort at citizen oversight is not functioning as it should. On Jan. 10, Tammy Baney, the commission's chairwoman, sent Gov. Kate Brown a letter asking for quarterly meetings with Brown, along with an independent staff person to carry out commissioners' requests for information and research. Baney also wants an "active" role in ODOT Director Matt Garrett's performance review. Most Oregon citizens will be surprised that such basic elements of independent oversight are not already in place. Without routine contact with the governor or a role in reviewing the ODOT director, the commission becomes little but a symbolic shell. Former commission Chairwoman Catherine Mater said the request for an independent staffer indicates "a complete disintegration of trust" between ODOT and the commission tasked with overseeing it. ODOT's front-line workers clearly understand what is going on. They told the consultants: "We need to ensure accountability for performance and behavior problems. High-level managers can talk the talk, but poor performers and poor behavior is still tolerated. Good employees currently work hard through internal motivation and personal dedication to high quality service, not because the agency rewards them." There is no doubt that Oregon needs substantial transportation upgrades and maintenance. During a recent visit to Astoria, outgoing Port of Portland Executive Director Bill Wyatt emphasized what most residents already know: Surrounding states invest more heavily in highways, bridges and other essential infrastructure. Though Wyatt understandably focuses most on obvious needs in the Portland metro region, he is largely right in asserting that it is a bottleneck that must be fixed in order to ensure a healthy future for the state's economic engine. Ultimately, even if Congress grants President Donald Trump's wish for major national infrastructure spending, Oregon taxpayers will have to pay much of the tab for the things we need. Deficiencies in ODOT's management system, along with the debacle of the failed Columbia Crossing project on Interstate 5, necessitate a convincing and thorough rebooting of this critical agency's managerial and oversight procedures. It will be a fool's errand to ask Oregon voters for a major hike in transportation-related taxes until this basic work is done and trust is restored. _ More like this story ODOT using eminent domain for Les Schwab land Dual Purpose: Darren Nichols confident commission can respond to priorities HR to study bridge replacement Hanford oversight questioned Editorial: Gorge panel funding should increase Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

Two new Lenovo Yoga Book tablets offer pen input and a physical keyboard unlike anything we’ve seen in the category before. On top of that, the company is refreshing the sleek Yoga 900 design with the Lenovo Yoga 910. Advertisement The new Lenovo Yoga Book tablets and Yoga 910 notebook are just three of the devices that the company announced at the IFA trade show this week. The Yoga line-up is all about enabling Windows users to turn their traditional PC or tablet into something different. Yoga notebooks have touchscreens and hinges that allow their displays to flip over, turning them into a tablet in a few moments. Some Lenovo Yoga tablets boast removable keyboards. The Lenovo Yoga Book with Windows and Yoga Book with Android have keyboards, but you can’t take them off. Instead, they both feature a blacklit keyboard deck. When illuminated, keys and a touchpad run the entire length of the flat deck. When not illuminated, the keys almost disappear. It’s a new twist on a problem Windows 2-in-1s have suffered from ever since Windows 8 launched in 2012. What do you users do with their 2-in-1s keyboard when they’re ready to stop typing? Keen to boost its transformer’s profile as a device that’s great for all kinds of creatives, Lenovo also added in support for a digitizer stylus they’re calling Real Pen. Lenovo is hoping that users will put a real sheet of paper over the keyboard area so that they can digitize their notes while writing. When their keyboard is off, Lenovo Yoga Book users can draw and sketch on the now dark keyboard deck. Advertisement Aside from differing operating systems, each of the Yoga Book PCs that Lenovo announced today boast 10.1-inch IPS displays with a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels, 64 GB of storage, Intel Atom X5 processors, mobile internet connectivity, Wi-Fi, GPS, ambient light sensors and GPS technology. They each offer cameras too. One is a 2 megapixel front-facing camera. The other is an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera for taking pictures of landscapes, friends and family. The Yoga Book with Windows and Yoga Book with Android do differ in some ways that matter. The Windows version gets Office Mobile apps for free, but only comes in black and lasts 13 hours on a single charge. The Android version gets two additional hours of battery life and comes pre-loaded with Lenovo’s notes, syncing and sharing apps; Google Docs is also included. The Lenovo Yoga Book with Windows will cost, $549 beginning this October. The Android version of the groundbreaking device will cost $499. Advertisement The Yoga 910 doesn’t have a completely new form factor, but don’t underestimate it. Its body is still svelte and sharp, with the entire PC closed measuring 0.56-inches from top to bottom. The Watchband hinge that defines Lenovo Yoga line is back. A lot of the tweaks Lenovo made with the Yoga 910 are inside. It boasts up to a 7th Generation Intel processor. That’s the latest processor technology to arrive from Intel, once known by their Kaby Lake designation. A fingerprint reader lets users log into the Yoga 910 using Microsoft’s Windows Hello option, a first for the Yoga 900 series notebooks. A single USB Type-C port can pull triple duty as a USB port, HDMI out and Ethernet port, with the right adapter. What’ll attract the most attention is the Yoga 910s upgraded display. Now Lenovo is using the same nearly bezel-less display technology that Dell uses in its notebooks. What’s more, the Lenovo Yoga 910 has an option for a 4K display. That translates to a sharper picture than in any of Lenovo’s other Yoga 2-in-1s. 4K displays have four times the amount of pixels of high-definition displays. Netflix and other content makers are all busy creating movies and television shows that support the technology Advertisement The Lenovo Yoga 910 will cost $1299.99 when it arrives this October. 3 Responses 10/09/2016 David Morton Reply What about a pen for the 910? 10/18/2016 rich cower Reply David, I’m wondering the same thing. If it has one, I’d buy now. 02/10/2017 Robert Reiner, PH.D.

By Conner Forrest | February 10, 2017, 7:32 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Sarah tew/CNET Google's browser-based Chromebooks have slowly been trickling into classrooms and offices over the last few years, but the new Samsung Chromebook Pro aims to make the devices even more useful for professionals. Announced in tandem with the Samsung Chromebook Plus at CES 2017, the Chromebook Pro is expected to ship sometime this spring. For starters, the Chromebook Pro utilizes the hybrid laptop-to-tablet foldover design that made many Windows machines popular, such as those in the Lenovo Yoga. It also features a touch screen and a passive stylus, which have proven popular among professionals. As far as specs go, the Chromebook Pro relies on an Intel Core m3 processor, and offers 32GB of internal SSD storage, two USB-C ports, and 4GB of memory. When it's available, it will cost $549. SEE: Chromebooks: The smart person's guide One of the biggest selling features for this Chromebook, and all that will come after it, is its support for Android apps through the Google Play Store. Google announced the crossover potential for the two ecosystems in May 2016, but it's just starting to take off in the market. Must-Read Cloud Microsoft offers free Windows 10 upgrades to certain customers Video: The hybrid cloud 'condition,' and what Amazon is doing to address it How Mark Shuttleworth became the first African in space and launched a software revolution (PDF download) Subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter The use of Android apps on supported Chromebooks opens up a host of new opportunities for productivity. However, many apps still don't support the form factor just yet. The design of the Chromebook Pro is utilitarian, but still professional—it wouldn't look out of place in a boardroom. Additionally, a CNET test of the device saw battery life of close to nine hours. All of these features combine to make a mid-level priced Chromebook that doesn't really feel like a Chromebook. But, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it could win over some professionals who are used to a more traditional OS and machine. CNET's Dan Ackerman even called it "the Chromebook for the Chromebook skeptic." Targeting education professionals and business users was always on Google's agenda for the Chromebook, and the Samsung Chromebook Pro represents the future of how OEMs will approach these devices for that audience. Acer and Asus both recently announced new Chromebooks that make use of styluses and a convertible form factor as well, so we will likely continue to see similar options from other providers. It's worth noting that Chromebook sales overtook Mac sales in the US in May 2016. Combine that with Google's G Suite advancements and its growing popularity among businesses, and it could be a sign that Chromebooks will eventually be seen more and more as an adequate business tool. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The Samsung Chromebook Pro has a plethora of features that enterprise users will find handy, and a popular convertible form factor. The Chromebook Pro will cost $549, and will be able to run Android apps. Chromebooks and Google's G Suite are growing in popularity among educators and business professionals alike.

In a broader sense, semiconductor and tech stocks are considered to be leading indicators for the markets in general. A strong rally in the tech sector largely pushed many of these companies to new highs, as the Dow and S&P are both hitting all-time highs. The January 31 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were mixed in these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest increase to 79.26 million shares. The previous level was 76.05 million. Shares were last seen at $35.46, in a 52-week trading range of $28.14 to $38.45. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short increased to 99.90 million from the previous level of 88.62 million shares. Shares recently traded at $13.42, in a 52-week range of $1.82 to $14.27. Note that like Intel and Micron, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short fall to 12.47 million, compared to the 13.76 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $52.88, in a 52-week range of $43.08 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) dropped to 12.10 million shares. The previous reading was 13.54 million. Shares were trading at $35.41, in a 52-week range of $15.50 to $35.85. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest decrease to 49.78 million shares from the previous reading of 59.55 million. Shares were trading at $24.45, in a 52-week range of $9.35 to $25.31. And the short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) increased to 5.42 million shares in the period, from the previous 3.76 million. Shares were last seen at $205.34, in a 52-week range of $115.73 to $208.75.

Laptops by Dan Ackerman February 10, 2017 7:00 AM PST @danackerman Sarah Tew/CNET Laptop trends come and go. We've lived through netbooks, ultrabooks and even stereoscopic 3D laptops (yes, that was a thing for a while). Most don't stick around for the long haul, so I originally approached Chromebooks with the same skepticism. The first couple of generations of Chromebooks were stripped-down laptops running Google's Chrome OS -- literally, little more than the browser as operating system -- and were more hype than reality. At best they worked for kids or the tech-averse: Fine for basics like email, Facebook and YouTube but it was a major struggle to make one of them your main machine. Now Chromebooks have had a few generations to evolve. Many have standard Intel Core processors, better file management and access to Android apps via the Google Play store. It now feels like the category has gotten a major reboot, as seen in the excellent new Samsung Chromebook Pro. Is it finally time to break down and admit that a good Chromebook is all the computer you're likely to need? The biggest hurdle might be getting past common preconceptions about the category. To test this theory, I gritted my teeth, dove right in, suffered through the classic five stages of Chromebook acceptance, and came out the other side. Josh Miller/CNET Denial I'm 100 percent not a Chromebook guy. I'm the type of person who needs a few hundred free GB of hard drive space for all the apps and files I collect. What if I want to do some registry tweaking? What if I want to update my drivers for a graphics card (or even have a graphics card)? I need Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Steam and a ton of other programs. Those are just not going to happen on a Chromebook, right? Why do you think Apple doesn't make a laptop that costs less than a thousand bucks? That's because you just need to spend that much to get anything really worthwhile. Why do you think a touchscreen Surface Pro from Microsoft costs around that much once you add the keyboard cover? Because good touch and stylus response requires a real investment. A Chromebook might be enough computer for you, but me? No way. Anger Freedom of choice is what PCs are all about. Everyone wants to put you in a walled garden of some sort. Apple is notorious for this, with the iOS App Store controlling what you can do (or not do) on an iPhone or iPad. Even MacOS MacBooks make it hard to install "unverified" apps without jumping through hoops. Chromebooks are the same way -- you can use any website you want, but the last time I tried a Chromebook only a handful of app-like tools from the Google Chrome OS store, and most of those were just junk, anyway. 25 Samsung Chromebook Pro As bad as Microsoft is with its Windows App Store, at least you can choose to completely ignore it and just install anything you want. Good luck trying that on a Chromebook. And if you really, really need to get a laptop for a rock-bottom price, there are a few full Windows models that cost $200-$300, as long as you don't mind the rock-bottom performance that goes along with them. If you get a Chromebook instead of a Windows 10 laptop, you're just cutting yourself off from the wider world of software, as well as tying your hands when it comes to tweaking and customizing how your own hardware works. I, for one, am not going to take that lying down -- they can have my .exe files when they pry them from my cold, dead fingers! Bargaining Maybe I'm being to harsh. I guess there are ways to work around Chrome OS limitations. Maybe I can use Pixlr instead of Photoshop. And I actually do spend most of my time surfing the web, or at least using web-based services and cloud-based tools -- so being locked into the Chrome web browser isn't really all that bad. I mean, I can still get to things like Amazon and Netflix. Sarah Tew/CNET Besides, adding access to the Google Play app store, and its millions of Android apps, fills in a lot of the blanks. It's going to be available on every new 2017 Chromebook (and several earlier models), and adds a ton of games, social media apps, and other tools. Some are optimized for the bigger laptop screen, others show up in phone-sized windows. It's almost like I should think of a new Chromebook as a laptop with some of the DNA of a phone. And while I still can't install the PC version of Microsoft Office, at least I can open emailed Excel docs or other files in the free cloud-based version of Office, or even in the Android version, which works surprisingly well on a Chromebook. I guess you have to pick your fights. Depression Do you know how can I tell this Chromebook isn't a serious get-work-done tool? The keyboard is labeled with all lowercase letters. How am I supposed to take that seriously? The Google Pixel (the Chrome OS device, not the phone), which cost as much as a MacBook, was a true high-end machine, but it's been discontinued. Aside from that, even so-called high-end Chromebooks feel kinda junky, with either flimsy plastic bodies, or meh-feeling metal bodies once you hit $400-$500. 15 An affordable 2-in-1 Chromebook that'll last you all day Remember playing PC games? Man, that was fun. I mean, you can get some phone versions of games on a Chromebook, especially if you go through the Android apps in the Google Play store, but it's not the same. Windows 10, for all its faults, has many useful tools built right in, like the News app or the notifications bar, and macOS has Photos, Siri and all that other built-in MacOS-based goodness. This, in contrast, is really just a web browser in a box, and even if I do manage to download something, most Chromebooks only have 16-32GB of space. Can I every show my face in my local coffee shop again? I don't want to be the only person there without a backlit fruit logo on my laptop... Acceptance I have to admit, compared to a lot of other lower-cost PCs I've used, this Chromebook I'm working on now (a Samsung Chromebook Pro with an Intel Core m3 processor) feels faster. Definitely less slowdown, better scrolling on web pages, and it wakes up as soon as I open the lid, much like a MacBook does. Sure, I'm not running "real" Photoshop, but most social media tools include basic photo editing now, which is probably why I haven't felt the need to install Photoshop on any Windows laptops I've tested in a while. And thanks to the Android apps available in the Google Play store, I'm running the mobile versions of Instagram and the Amazon Alexa app, which is something you generally can't do on a laptop. (A few potentially useful Android apps either wouldn't run or didn't work properly, including Snapchat, Uber and Pokemon Go.) Sarah Tew/CNET Let's go down my list of PC priorities -- Gmail, Google Docs, Facebook and Twitter: check. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime video: check -- although Amazon doesn't have a Google Play app, so you'll have to use the web-based version or sideload the apk (Android installation file), which requires messing around in the Chromebook's developer mode. (I don't recommend that, since it means shutting off some of the nice security features that Google has added to keep the Android apps safely walled off.) I've now traveled the five stages and reached Chromebook acceptance. While it's still more fun to use something very high-end, like the new MacBook Pro or the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, I'm more than happy to take one of the new generation of Chromebooks to my local coffee shop or even on a trip, and it's hard to think of a better overall bang for your buck in PCs right now. If you're looking to spend around $500 on a new laptop, the question is no longer, "Can you get away with using a Chromebook?" but instead, "Why aren't you already using a Chromebook?"

Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Ninety-seven companies, from Apple Inc. to Zynga Inc., filed an impassioned legal brief condemning President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, stepping up the industry’s growing opposition to the policy. The amicus brief was filed late on Sunday in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and emphasizes the importance of immigrants in the economy and society. The companies originally planned to file the brief later this coming week, but accelerated efforts over the weekend after other legal challenges to the order, according to people familiar with the matter. The participating technology companies include Airbnb Inc., Facebook Inc., Google, Intel Corp., Netflix Inc., Snap Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. Companies beyond technology signed on as well, including Levi Strauss & Co. and yogurt maker Chobani LLC. “Immigrants make many of the Nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies,” the brief states. “America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants—through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.” Late Friday, a US District judge temporarily lifted the Trump administration’s ban, freeing refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim-majority countries to enter the US. An appeals court declined to immediately reinstate the immigration restrictions over the weekend. The technology industry has been among the most vocal in opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. Bloomberg News reported earlier that several large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., are planning to sign an open letter to President Trump expressing concern about the immigration order and offering help fixing it and other policies. “We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today’s security needs and keeps our country safe,” said a draft of that letter obtained by Bloomberg News. “We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country’s success.” Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick stepped down from President Trump’s business advisory council last week after criticism from customers and drivers. His participation in the council, along with more than a dozen other US executives, prompted blow-back on social media after the controversial executive order on immigration. It snowballed into a #DeleteUber campaign that benefited rival Lyft. “Immigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country’s success and quite honestly to Uber’s,” Kalanick wrote in an e-mail to employees obtained by Bloomberg. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America.” Bloomberg Mark BergenSarah Frier Topics: Donald Trump executive order legal brief Immigration ban Apple More From Livemint READ MORE AIADMK crisis: Sasikala seeks appointment with TN Governor to parade MLAs Manish Sisodia files RTI on Centre’s ad initiatives on social media Quantum mutual fund to start paying distributors for 1st time in 10-year history First Published: Mon, Feb 06 2017. 08 45 AM IST Editor's Picks Infosys row seen as Narayana Murthy vs Vishal Sikka personality clash Govt appoints directors of 10 IIMs; G.

Laptops by Dan Ackerman February 10, 2017 7:00 AM PST @danackerman Sarah Tew/CNET Laptop trends come and go. We've lived through netbooks, ultrabooks and even stereoscopic 3D laptops (yes, that was a thing for a while). Most don't stick around for the long haul, so I originally approached Chromebooks with the same skepticism. The first couple of generations of Chromebooks were stripped-down laptops running Google's Chrome OS -- literally, little more than the browser as operating system -- and were more hype than reality. At best they worked for kids or the tech-averse: Fine for basics like email, Facebook and YouTube but it was a major struggle to make one of them your main machine. Now Chromebooks have had a few generations to evolve. Many have standard Intel Core processors, better file management and access to Android apps via the Google Play store. It now feels like the category has gotten a major reboot, as seen in the excellent new Samsung Chromebook Pro. Is it finally time to break down and admit that a good Chromebook is all the computer you're likely to need? The biggest hurdle might be getting past common preconceptions about the category. To test this theory, I gritted my teeth, dove right in, suffered through the classic five stages of Chromebook acceptance, and came out the other side. Josh Miller/CNET Denial I'm 100 percent not a Chromebook guy. I'm the type of person who needs a few hundred free GB of hard drive space for all the apps and files I collect. What if I want to do some registry tweaking? What if I want to update my drivers for a graphics card (or even have a graphics card)? I need Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Steam and a ton of other programs. Those are just not going to happen on a Chromebook, right? Why do you think Apple doesn't make a laptop that costs less than a thousand bucks? That's because you just need to spend that much to get anything really worthwhile. Why do you think a touchscreen Surface Pro from Microsoft costs around that much once you add the keyboard cover? Because good touch and stylus response requires a real investment. A Chromebook might be enough computer for you, but me? No way. Anger Freedom of choice is what PCs are all about. Everyone wants to put you in a walled garden of some sort. Apple is notorious for this, with the iOS App Store controlling what you can do (or not do) on an iPhone or iPad. Even MacOS MacBooks make it hard to install "unverified" apps without jumping through hoops. Chromebooks are the same way -- you can use any website you want, but the last time I tried a Chromebook only a handful of app-like tools from the Google Chrome OS store, and most of those were just junk, anyway. 25 Samsung Chromebook Pro As bad as Microsoft is with its Windows App Store, at least you can choose to completely ignore it and just install anything you want. Good luck trying that on a Chromebook. And if you really, really need to get a laptop for a rock-bottom price, there are a few full Windows models that cost $200-$300, as long as you don't mind the rock-bottom performance that goes along with them. If you get a Chromebook instead of a Windows 10 laptop, you're just cutting yourself off from the wider world of software, as well as tying your hands when it comes to tweaking and customizing how your own hardware works. I, for one, am not going to take that lying down -- they can have my .exe files when they pry them from my cold, dead fingers! Bargaining Maybe I'm being to harsh. I guess there are ways to work around Chrome OS limitations. Maybe I can use Pixlr instead of Photoshop. And I actually do spend most of my time surfing the web, or at least using web-based services and cloud-based tools -- so being locked into the Chrome web browser isn't really all that bad. I mean, I can still get to things like Amazon and Netflix. Sarah Tew/CNET Besides, adding access to the Google Play app store, and its millions of Android apps, fills in a lot of the blanks. It's going to be available on every new 2017 Chromebook (and several earlier models), and adds a ton of games, social media apps, and other tools. Some are optimized for the bigger laptop screen, others show up in phone-sized windows. It's almost like I should think of a new Chromebook as a laptop with some of the DNA of a phone. And while I still can't install the PC version of Microsoft Office, at least I can open emailed Excel docs or other files in the free cloud-based version of Office, or even in the Android version, which works surprisingly well on a Chromebook. I guess you have to pick your fights. Depression Do you know how can I tell this Chromebook isn't a serious get-work-done tool? The keyboard is labeled with all lowercase letters. How am I supposed to take that seriously? The Google Pixel (the Chrome OS device, not the phone), which cost as much as a MacBook, was a true high-end machine, but it's been discontinued. Aside from that, even so-called high-end Chromebooks feel kinda junky, with either flimsy plastic bodies, or meh-feeling metal bodies once you hit $400-$500. 15 An affordable 2-in-1 Chromebook that'll last you all day Remember playing PC games? Man, that was fun. I mean, you can get some phone versions of games on a Chromebook, especially if you go through the Android apps in the Google Play store, but it's not the same. Windows 10, for all its faults, has many useful tools built right in, like the News app or the notifications bar, and macOS has Photos, Siri and all that other built-in MacOS-based goodness. This, in contrast, is really just a web browser in a box, and even if I do manage to download something, most Chromebooks only have 16-32GB of space. Can I every show my face in my local coffee shop again? I don't want to be the only person there without a backlit fruit logo on my laptop... Acceptance I have to admit, compared to a lot of other lower-cost PCs I've used, this Chromebook I'm working on now (a Samsung Chromebook Pro with an Intel Core m3 processor) feels faster. Definitely less slowdown, better scrolling on web pages, and it wakes up as soon as I open the lid, much like a MacBook does. Sure, I'm not running "real" Photoshop, but most social media tools include basic photo editing now, which is probably why I haven't felt the need to install Photoshop on any Windows laptops I've tested in a while. And thanks to the Android apps available in the Google Play store, I'm running the mobile versions of Instagram and the Amazon Alexa app, which is something you generally can't do on a laptop. (A few potentially useful Android apps either wouldn't run or didn't work properly, including Snapchat, Uber and Pokemon Go.) Sarah Tew/CNET Let's go down my list of PC priorities -- Gmail, Google Docs, Facebook and Twitter: check. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime video: check -- although Amazon doesn't have a Google Play app, so you'll have to use the web-based version or sideload the apk (Android installation file), which requires messing around in the Chromebook's developer mode. (I don't recommend that, since it means shutting off some of the nice security features that Google has added to keep the Android apps safely walled off.) I've now traveled the five stages and reached Chromebook acceptance. While it's still more fun to use something very high-end, like the new MacBook Pro or the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, I'm more than happy to take one of the new generation of Chromebooks to my local coffee shop or even on a trip, and it's hard to think of a better overall bang for your buck in PCs right now. If you're looking to spend around $500 on a new laptop, the question is no longer, "Can you get away with using a Chromebook?" but instead, "Why aren't you already using a Chromebook?"

Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit $15 Soon BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Worth $8 a Share View All Posts There is nothing more painful for investors than watching a stock that once traded at $1.81 soaring six-fold in the last year. The higher shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) goes, the riskier it gets for investors. AMD stock still has $1.44 billion in debt against $1.26 billion in cash and equivalents. In early March, the chip supplier is about to make its biggest launch its his history with Ryzen, and that’s bound to make a lot of noise. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr For the time being, details of AMD’s Ryzen are limited. Although the company recently demoed the chip in a gameplay demonstration, it gave no details on the chip’s pricing. Without knowing what Ryzen offers at a price-to-performance ratio compared to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), the harder it is to predict Ryzen’s sales when it launches. AMD’s (Leaked) Ryzen Roadmap If the leaked rumors are true, AMD will launch three classes of PC chips: high-range, medium-range and entry-level. Denoted R7 (8 core, 16 threads), R5 (4-6 core, 8-12 threads) and R3 (4 core, 4 threads), respectively, the CPUs will differ by core, thread and clock speed. The mid- and high-range chips will compete with Intel’s mainstream processors, the i5 and i7. Click to Enlarge Ryzen’s processor speed does not aim to out-clock that of Intel chips. Rather, AMD’s strategy primarily targets the enthusiast PC game community. Ryzen will pair with the next-generation GPU (graphics processing unit) Vega chips. After Ryzen’s launch in March, AMD will release Vega sometime in the second quarter. Mentions of Ryzen picked up again on Feb 9. Ryzen’s Processor Size Although Advanced Micro Devices is manufacturing Zen on 14nm, its an area of 44 square millimeters implies that the chip will at least match or beat Intel’s chips. Before Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD did not talk about manufacturing at 14nm. Prior to Ryzen, Advanced Micro Devices embraced x86 chips at 28nm. The engineering achievement will lead to lower manufacturing costs and higher profit margins for AMD stock. On its conference call, the company revealed that it aimed to achieve gross margin of around 33% in the first quarter. In the quarters before that, its gross margin hovered in the 31%-range due to the product mix. With Ryzen on the list, expect that profitability number to improve quarter after quarter.

By Maghan McDowell on February 10, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Paul Dillinger, VP of global innovation, Levi Strauss & Co Misha Vladimirskiy SAN FRANCISCO — Google and Levi’s aren’t the most obvious of partners, but their coming together is the stuff of which Silicon Valley stories are made. As Paul Dillinger, vice president of global innovation at Levi Strauss & Co., tells it, two-and-a-half years ago, Levi’s president James Curleigh sat down to dinner with Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group. The group’s purview was to “make epic stuff,” and part of that was taking on what a successful wearable looked like. So they reached out to a number of companies, wondering what could be done with Levi’s, which came to prominence during the city’s original gold rush 150 years before Google tapped into tech gold just south of San Francisco. When Dillinger heard about a possible project to inject apparel with an interactive capability, he was not initially into the idea. “Why would I take on a challenge this difficult?” Dillinger wondered. They’re both two very big companies that might not naturally be adept at collaboration. He noted that Google was about radical change and inventing the future, unencumbered by supply chains, while Levi’s “predicates its value on six-month radical change — whether it’s jeggings or a skinny jean — within a normal set of parameters,” from a supply-chain standpoint. But then as Dillinger was riding his bike through the city, he landed on a use case that made sense: The result is Levi’s Commuter Trucker Jacket, which uses interactive fiber using Google’s Jacquard technology and is made to be used by urban cyclists. Wearers can touch the fabric on the sleeve to perform functions on their smart phone, such as controlling music or silencing calls. The jacket is expected to become available for consumer demos in March. Dillinger said it’s one example of a way to make wearable tech usable. “You might not go to Google for a great pair of sunglasses, but you’ll go to Levi’s for a great jean jacket, so you should go to the partner who will offer the form part that will enhance the opportunity you have with technology,” Dillinger said. He added that a successful wearable might not look like an unknown thing, and that the entirely familiar — like a jean jacket — might be a better starting point. The key factor, he said, is that to avoid being just a gadget, wearable tech must align with customer needs. “The brands understand those the best — not the creators in the lab,” he said. Dillinger was speaking at a panel hosted at the Macy’s Fashion Incubator here, along with Andrew Lutjens, fashion wearables business strategist at Intel, and Nicole Mason, director of digital media and marketing at macys.com, about working on useful fashion and technology projects. Lutjens emphasized the need for the designers to create the products, while Intel supplied the technology inside. “Intel is all about partnerships,” Lutjens said. “We need brands to bring product to market. We are the experts when it comes to tech, but we rely on brand partners.” To that end, Intel recently challenged the 10 designers in the CFDA’s Vogue Fashion Fund incubator to use the Intel Curie chip in a design. Mason described how Macy’s worked with Alibaba’s TMall to create a virtual reality shopping experience in the store’s Herald Square location, and an artificially intelligent app with IBM’s Watson to make a store-specific directory. Going forward, she predicted chatbots will one day replace apps — Macy’s has one with Facebook Messenger — and that thanks to augmented reality and VR, customers will be able to have a full, in-store shopping experience without leaving home. Dillinger said wearables will fuel a return to bricks-and-mortar shopping as “no amount of explanation will get you the same experience. When everything you buy can do something, we finally have that one thing to fight against fast fashion. Bricks-and-mortar will be the place you go to discover this new thing.” You're missing something!

They get you online and let you stream movies and music. You can even play a few games on your Chromebook. And now, with the Samsung Chromebook Plus, available Feb. 12, and Pro, available this April, Chromebooks let you run any of the millions of Android apps available through the Google Play Store right out of the box. To be sure, the Chromebook Plus and Pro aren’t the first Chromebooks to offer Android app compatibility; three older Chromebooks can already run Android apps via software updates. But these are the first Chromebooks purpose-built with Android apps in mind. The Plus and Pro aren’t perfect, though. There are still some kinks to work out when it comes to running Android apps on a 12-inch laptop. And they’ve got some stiff competition in the form of Apple’s iPad Pro. Still, for the first time, I’m genuinely considering buying a Chromebook. Plus and Pro: The same, but different Let’s get one thing out of the way before I dive into this review: the difference between the Plus and the Pro. In general, the systems are identical. They share the same design, though the Plus is silver and the Pro is black; the have the same 12.3-inch screen and they both included styluses. Styli? Stylusses? You know what? Let’s just say they both have pens. View photos The main difference between the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro is on the inside.More The main difference between these systems is their processors. The Chromebook Plus runs on an ARM processor and costs $449, while the Chromebook Pro gets a more powerful Intel chip and costs $549. How do you decide between the two? Easy. The Plus is meant for basic web browsing and gaming. Think people who check their email or use Google Drive often. The Pro, on the other hand, is for folks who tend to browse the web with 20 tabs open, while streaming music through Spotify and perusing Twitter and Facebook. Handsome hardware The Plus and Pro are thin and lightweight at just 0.55 inches thick and 2.4 pounds, respectively. I packed the Chromebook Plus into my backpack along with my regular MacBook Air 13-inch and hardly noticed the added weight. Unlike most Chromebooks, the Plus and Pro also double as tablets thanks to their 360-degree-hinged, 12.3-inch, 2,400 x 1,600 resolution displays. I watched some movies and browsed the web and found the Pro’s display to be crisp and colorful. Apple’s 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros are both thinner, lighter and have higher resolution screens than Samsung’s Chromebooks. But Apple’s offerings are also far more expensive. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro starts at $599, while the 12.9-inch model starts at $799. And that’s without the added cost of a keyboard and stylus. Styling stylus Speaking of styluses, the Chromebook Plus and Pro’s each have small ports built into their sides to store the pens when not in use. The iPad Pro does not. Writing with the stylus feels incredibly natural thanks to a bit of added resistance provided by its tip and Google’s machine learning magic. View photos The Chromebook Plus and Pro use Google’s machine learning software to cut down on lag when writing with the stylus.More See, Google has programmed the Plus and Pro to understand how most people write. As a result, the Chromebooks are able to predict how fast you’re jotting something down, and all but eliminate the kind of lag that makes writing with a stylus feel unnatural. The Plus and Pro’s displays are also pressure sensitive — so if you press hard while writing, you’ll see a wider, darker pen stroke. Read More Keyboard problems The Plus and Pro are well-built machines, but they do have some problems. Compared to the full-size keyboard on my MacBook Air, the Chromebooks’ keyboards feel cramped, leading me to strike the wrong keys on occasion. What’s more, the Chromebook Plus and Pro only feature USB C ports, so you’ll need to purchase a separate adapter if you want to connect legacy devices like printers. On the flip side, though, the Plus and Pro is a microSD card slot and headphone jack. As far as battery life goes, I spent the majority of my day typing away on the Chromebook Pro and didn’t need to plug it in until I got home at night. Android goes Chrome It’s great that the Plus and Pro are well-built, but the biggest reason you’d by these Chrome OS-powered machines is that they run Android apps. Core Google apps like Gmail, YouTube and Calendar all run in Chrome browser-style windows, while a handful of others like Maps and the Play Store run in their own independent, resizable Windows. But third-party apps need a bit more polish. View photos Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro are the first Chromebooks purpose-built for using Android apps.More Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Spotify all run as enlarged versions of their smartphone or tablet versions. Spotify in particular is difficult to navigate, due to the app’s confusing and stretched interface. Hulu also proved bothersome, as the Chrome OS toolbar cut off subtitles. I also noticed that I couldn’t watch videos in Netflix while browsing the web in Chrome, which was a major pain, especially when I was trying to stream “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” at the office while pretending to do work. Apple’s iPad Pro, on the other hand, lets you stream Netflix and Hulu while browsing the web via picture-in-picture mode. But again, you’re going to pay a lot more money for that privilege compared to Samsung’s Chromebooks. Should you buy it? Sure, you’re not going to get the kind of performance out of a Chromebook that you would out of a more powerful Windows PC or MacBook, but the Plus and Pro will prove to be more than enough for the majority of users. In other words, if you want a low-cost alternative to your PC, Mac or even iPad Pro, go for the Chromebook Plus or Pro.

Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Android Review Personal Tech Samsung's Chromebook Pro: Overpriced vanilla PC with a stylus. 'Wow' Sammy attempts to take Chrome OS high end. Key word, attempts 10 Feb 2017 at 14:01, Iain Thomson Hands-on It's been nearly six years since Google announced the launch of its own operating system, Chrome OS, and the CR‑48 Chromebook running it. Since then, Chromebooks have carved out a solid chunk of market share for the operating system. Around 50 per cent of US schoolchildren use Chromebooks in the classroom and Chrome OS is now the second most popular operating system in the country. Typically a Chromebook will sell for under $200, and that's a major selling point for such systems. The vast majority of time spent on a laptop is either watching the internet or videos, emailing, and writing, and the Chromebook can handle all of that easily, and if little Timmy breaks his, it's cheap to replace and easy to reinstall lost applications. But there's precious little profit in computers that cheap, so computer manufacturers have been trying out more expensive models. Google kicked this off in 2013 with the Pixel, a $1,449 machine aimed at wooing over Apple users. It's a good machine (our review unit still works fine four years later) but at that price, it didn't find many takers. Now Samsung is taking a go at selling to more cash-rich buyers with its Chromebook Pro, a $549 laptop that it's hoping will find favor in the workplace. It goes on sale in April. Convertible to cash in? The first impression of the Pro was pretty good – it's a small, light unit with a very impressive 12.3-inch screen. The machine has a stylus built into the casing and is light enough at 2.38lb to make lugging it around easy. The 281 x 222 x 14mm magnesium casing feels fairly sturdy and has proved scratch resistant in the week or so we've had it. The only jarring note was the protruding volume rocker and power buttons, which stick out a millimetre or so and occasionally catch on something when retrieving the Pro from a tight rucksack. The 2,400 by 1,600 pixel touchscreen is a lovely bit of kit, clear and bright and with a 3:2 aspect ratio that makes it very handy for documents and web pages. While the forums show that there are plenty of skeptics out there on the merits of a touchscreen, this responsive system shows the best points of the technology and you get accustomed to using it for scrolling over a button or mouse. Getting the screen right is important, because the Pro is also a convertible. The screen is held on 360-degree hinges and it folds over to make a useable, if somewhat bulky, tablet. There's also a 720p camera for videoconferencing at the top of the screen. The Pro's convertible hinge is a nice touch, but a detachable keyboard would be nicer The 113mm rectangular stylus, housed in the top right of the unit, is certainly handy, and having a dedicated slot for it is a definite advantage that you don't get with fancier systems like Microsoft's Surface. There's not much latency in on-screen writing with the stylus (Wacom supplied the technology) and it's useful enough – but only if you have a need for such a widget. Popping out the stylus brings up a menu option for its common uses Under the hood there's a moderately powerful 2.2GHz Intel Core M3‑6Y30 processor and HD Graphics 515 chipset, a somewhat measly 4GB of LPDDR3 memory, and 32GB of internal storage – good enough but just barely. However, in the latter case there's also a slot to allow microSD storage cards to augment the internal capacity – a very welcome feature that The Reg wishes more phone and laptop manufacturers would use. For connectivity, there's twin-antenna 802.11ac Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth version 4. The Pro also comes with two USB-C ports (for pity's sake, Apple – learn from this) and a Type C to Type A converter plug ships with the system. The Pro comes with a 39Wh battery that gives a solid nine hours of performance. In our tests we ran about an hour of video, another hour of gaming, and then a full work day before reaching for the charger. We could have gone more than nine hours if we'd lowered the screen brightness or cut down on music videos. So far it all looks fairly good, however, the Pro's outer shell does come with faults. The keyboard is the Pro's worst feature, with OKish key travel but some dumb design decisions. The often-used backspace button has been chopped down, making it easy to mishit. As an added bonus, the lockscreen button is directly above the backspace key, giving added possibilities for mishit keys. After typing for a week, the best you can say about the keyboard is that you get used to it; it lacks the smooth feel of an older ThinkPad or Pixel system. The only other hardware letdown was the overall feel of the device. It has little of the reassuring solidity of a Macbook Air or Pixel Chromebook, and instead feels somewhat flimsy and the shell can be flexed with the hands. Android and Chrome, sittin' in a tree The Pro will be one of the first Chromebooks to ship with enables support for running Android apps. Right now, that support is in beta and unfinished. Pretty much ever since Chrome OS emerged, people have been asking when Android phone and tablet applications will come to Google's laptop operation system. At last year's I/O developer conference, Google committed to the marriage of its two platforms. To pull this off, Android isn't opened in an emulator, but in a separate container that's sandboxed from the main laptop operating system. In tests, this worked fairly well, and I suspect it's going to be a real selling point once Google finishes the software and Android developers catch on. Theoretically, this fusion opens up a vast new range of applications that can run on Chrome OS. One of the weaknesses of Chrome was that developers didn't write enough good apps for it, so the combo system fills that gap. Up to a point, that is. While the Pro attempts to run 'droid apps, and allows them to use the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope for control and share the cut'n'paste clipboard with Chrome OS, some applications won't run, or run as you would like them. The secure messaging app Signal won't work on the Pro, and my most commonly played game, Age of Civilisations, won't run in full-screen mode. You have to brace yourself for disappointment. Android apps show up on-screen in either phone or tablet mode, or full screen, for instance. This is supposed to be fixed when Android Nougat is brought to Chrome OS and applications are updated – right now, the Chrome OS on the Pro we reviewed is running Marshmallow. Developers will need to do some work to accommodate the fusion with Chrome OS Developers are going to need to do some reworking of their apps so their software performs reliably on x86-based laptops rather than an ARM-powered phones. But they almost certainly will, eventually, since this marriage of Android and Chrome will open up new markets and revenue streams when done properly. Security is another big advantage of the Chrome OS. The built-in Trusted Platform Module makes the Chrome OS very difficult to get malware onto and Google is offering six-figure bounties for people who can show them how to do it – with no takers so far. To buy or not to buy The Pro is clearly positioned to go up against the iPad Pro and does have a lot to recommend it on that front – principally, it's a lot cheaper. However, the undetachable keyboard make the Samsung Pro a lot less fun to use as a tablet than its Apple rival. There are some nice design features, like the internally housed stylus, and a few bad ones too. The technical specs are disappointing, too – Chromebook watchers had been hoping for at least 8GB or 16GB of RAM in a so-called "Pro" laptop. Knock maybe $100 off the purchase price and the Chromebook Pro would be a good buy, but at $549 it's too much. An HDMI port would have been nice too, although Samsung will sell you an adaptor for that. In all, it's an adequate bit of kit. If you like Chrome OS, it's not a bad pick, and the Android integration is enabled but unfinished. One can't help feeling that it's a lot of money for just enough hardware. Slapping the word "Pro" on a laptop, and bunging in a stylus for good measure, doesn't mean you can just jack up the price: there has to be a justification. ® Tips and corrections 48 Comments More from The Register Silence is golden: How Google hunts Android malware in the wild When mobes and gadgets stop verifying app installations, you're gonna have a bad time 20 Comments More mobe malware creeps into Google Play – this time, ransomware Charger seeks to drain bank accounts of unlucky 'droids 5 Comments Google's Chrome cloaks Pirate Bay in red screen of malware death Scam ads abound 29 Comments Did Apple leak a photo of its new Macbook Pro in an OS update?

Review: Acer Chromebook R 13 -- a... Review: Acer Chromebook 14 for Work... Asus Chromebook Flip review: A classy... For the most part, Chromebooks -- laptops that use Google's Chrome OS -- have been marketed as either lightweight and inexpensive student systems or low-end secondary machines for travel or family use. With one or two exceptions (such as Google's Pixel), the emphasis was on cheapness of both price and materials. Lately, however, more vendors have been introducing Chromebooks meant for mid-level business use. For example, the recently-released Acer Chromebook R 13 is a solid convertible that can handle day-to-day computing tasks (its sibling, the Acer Chromebook 14 for Work, is aimed even more directly at a business usership). Back in January during the CES trade show, Samsung announced two new laptops in this class: the Chromebook Plus, which will ship with an ARM processor, and Chromebook Pro, which is pretty much identical except that it will be powered by an Intel Core m3. I spent a couple of weeks with a pre-production model of the Pro; I was assured that, except for the color of the unit (it is silver, while the final will be black), it was identical to a production unit. And I've got to say, I was impressed. Like the Acer R 13, the Pro is a convertible, meaning that its touchscreen display can bend 360 degree, from a "closed laptop" position to a traditional typing position,  further back to a "tented" presentation position, and finally all the way back to a tablet position. [ Further reading: Singapore’s ‘city brain’ project is groundbreaking -- but what about privacy? ] The Pro comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is a USB-C slot on the right edge of the keyboard, along with the power and volume buttons; the left edge has a second USB-C slot, a headphone/mic jack and a microSD slot. Interesting display Instead of the usual 16:9 aspect ratio that most laptop displays (and TV manufacturers) offer, the 12.3-in. Pro display (like that of the Chromebook Pixel ) comes in a squarer 3:2 aspect ratio, one more conducive to browsing or document creation. The display takes a little getting used to if you're used to the wider screens, but as a business laptop, it works well. And because the convertible is not as wide as most 12-in. laptops (closed, it measures 11.06 x 8.72 x 0.55 in.), I found it easier to hold in its tablet configuration. The 2400 x 1600 Quad HD LED display did a fine job with several Netflix films and YouTube videos; the color was bright and rich, and it handled action and low-light scenes with little problem. The two stereo speakers located on either side of the bottom of the keyboard had good volume and reasonable fidelity. And when you watch videos on long flights, you'll able to do so confidently. In our battery test, which involves constantly running a variety of videos at 75% brightness, the Chromebook Pro lasted a little over 6 hours and 40 minutes; with normal usage, I wouldn't be surprised if you got at least a couple of days out of it before it needed recharging. Slotted stylus Another feature that distinguishes the Pro (and the Plus) is the inclusion of a simple stylus, about 4-3/8 in. long, which pops out of a slot on the right side of the keyboard.  According to Samsung, the new systems use a machine learning algorithm that pulls data from Google's indexing and OCR cloud databases to make handwritten notes searchable and to reduce latency (the time lag between when a pen touches screen and the "ink" stroke appears). I must admit I was skeptical, but much to my surprise, when I searched for words included in written notes on Google Keep (using my not-especially-clear handwriting), it worked nicely. (I also searched for some words that were not in the documents, and none of them came up in the search.)  The experience of using the stylus on the touchscreen was also impressive; the screen is very responsive and the act of drawing or writing -- which can be awkward if there is any kind of discernible time lag -- was smooth and felt very natural. There was still some lag, occasionally, but less than I've experienced on other touch systems, and that could improve by the time the Pro ships. That being said, the small size of the stylus makes it less than ideal for taking more than a few quick notes -- after a few minutes, my hand started feeling cramped. As a result, if you plan to do any extensive writing or drawing (and considering how well it feels to write on the display, you might), I'd invest in something more comfortable to hold. Performance and other features The Pro's all-metal chassis is sleek and attractive, and felt as though it would last, although the cover and bottom did bend in slightly when pressed. The keyboard had a good, solid feel and I had no trouble using it through long typing sessions; the medium-sized touchpad, while not as large as on most premium systems, was also comfortable to work with.  The Pro scored 20781 on the Octane 2.0 performance benchmark, which is in the general neighborhood of other Chromebooks running Intel Core m3 processors; I didn't experience any lag or other problems, even when running 10 or more browser tabs. Finally, Samsung's new Chromebooks are part of the generation that will work with Android apps; the review unit used a beta version of the App Store, but according to Samsung, the App Store for Chromebooks will have come out of beta by the time the Pro ships. While some Android apps may not be a perfect match for a larger display, the few I tried worked well. Bottom line In the weeks that I worked with the Samsung Chromebook Pro, I found it an excellent go-to computer for both travel and at-home use.  It is not inexpensive for a Chromebook -- it will be priced at $549 when it ships at the end of April (the Chromebook Plus, which will be available this coming Sunday, will list at $449). But for a good looking and performing Chromebook with a durable metal frame, comfortable keyboard and excellent touch display, along with the included stylus, you may find it worth the cost.

Google’s affordable “just a browser” devices are the best-selling computers in schools, and they’re percolating around boardrooms and cubicles. Last fall, more people bought Chromebooks than Macs—and that’s not going to switch back anytime soon. Now Google’s out to convince you, regular human, person of sound mind and reasonable budget, that you ought to buy a Chromebook.

The Plus starts at $450 and is available next week, and the Pro will be $550 when it ships in March. Both fit right into the normal-person laptop budget. They do all the Chrome OS things, have great and flippy touchscreens, and even support pen input. And best of all, they run all of the millions of apps in Google’s Play Store. They’re part smartphone, part tablet, part laptop, combined in a way that feels like the computer of the future. I’ve been using the Pro for the last couple of weeks. Like I said, it sounds great… on paper. In reality, this brilliantly polymorphic computer still feels more like a science experiment. The Good Kind of Cheap It shouldn’t be that hard to make a good laptop. Most people want the same things: A relatively light and thin body, attractive enough you don’t mind being seen with it in public. Well-spaced, clicky keyboard, and spacious, smooth trackpad. High-res screen, and enough power and battery to get you through even an extra-long day at work. Pretty straightforward, right? According to your average $500 Best Buy Special, this is very hard. The Chromebook Pro proves it’s at least possible. At about a half-inch thick and 2.38 pounds, it’s smaller than almost every laptop not named MacBook. It doesn’t ooze class and wealth every time you open the lid, but the magnesium alloy body (mine’s silver, but yours will be black) at least won’t look out of place in Economy Comfort. Even more so once you peel off the unsightly Energy Star sticker. The rounded edges and exposed hinge give it a decidedly utilitarian look—you’re not holding a future Smithsonian exhibit in your hands, you’re holding a laptop. And that’s just fine. The 12.3-inch, 2400×1600 display is excellent, and works well as a touchscreen too. But it really shines when you pop the tiny stylus out of the body of the Chromebook Pro. The stylus matches the one in Samsung’s Galaxy Note phones, and works just as well: you can draw, doodle, take notes, the whole nine. Google’s Keep note-taking app supports the pen as an input tool, and works fabulously. Trust me: there’s nothing quite so futuristic as signing a contract right on your computer screen.

Check Out Samsung’s New Chromebooks David Pierce Review: HP Chromebook 13 David Pierce Attention, College Students: Chromebooks Are About to Get Awesome Gordon Gottsegen Android and Chromebooks Are Taking Over The whole kit runs on Intel’s Core M3 processor and four gigs of RAM. (The Chromebook Plus, which comes out next week and costs $450, runs on a lower-powered OP1 chip.) It has 32 gigs of internal storage, plus a microSD slot for adding more. None of those specs really matter, because power’s not an issue here and rarely ever is one on Chromebooks as a whole. The Chrome browser is so stable on these machines that it can handle more tabs and apps than my MacBook Pro. Not to mention, I get upwards of ten hours on the battery before I have to charge it. I used it basically non-stop during an hour-long train ride and six hours of flights, and still had plenty of battery left to watch The Good Place before bed. When you open the Pro’s lid, you’ll notice it never really stops opening. You can flip the screen a full 360 degrees, turning your laptop into a tablet. An awkward tablet, since the keyboard’s sitting right there on the back underneath your fingers, but a tablet nonetheless. It also sits sturdily like a teepee or like a digital picture frame, keyboard-down, both of which I used a lot—I sometimes watch Netflix while I cook, and it’s nice being able to hide the keyboard and trackpad from splattering olive oil. The downside of the 360-degree screen is that in order to accommodate all the ways you can hold it, Samsung had to make some weird layout choices. The power button’s on the right side, for instance, where I guarantee you’ll hit it by accident at least once a day. The headphone jack’s in the right place in laptopping (left side, at the rear) and thus bizarrely positioned for every other mode. Those are all necessary compromises for this form factor. I like it, so I’ll take the compromises. I only have two true hardware problems: the speakers are terrible, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. Which is just stupid. But even with those issues, you won’t find better laptop hardware for this price. It’s thin, it’s fast enough, it’s long-lasting, it looks like a laptop made this decade. For $550, that’s a minor miracle. Samsung Harder Than It Looks The hardware works, but the Chromebook Pro’s software doesn’t. Google says everything will be fine before the device formally launches in April, and I have no reason to believe that’s not true. But from what I’ve seen so far, this hyper-versatile software trails way behind the hardware. Evidently combining Android and Chrome OS wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Some apps don’t recognize the keyboard and trackpad; others seem unable to handle a touchscreen. Some apps steadfastly refuse to connect to the internet. Most crash constantly, when they even open at all. Games beyond Solitaire-level complexity won’t run at all, not even on this more powerful model. Three times so far, the Chromebook Pro has crashed so spectacularly that I got a dozen error messages and the whole machine shut down. The whole point of a Chromebook is that things like that never happen. Evidently combining Android and Chrome OS wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Then there are the bugs. Oh, the bugs! Like the one where you flip the screen over to put the Pro in tent mode, and all your browser tabs disappear for no reason. Or how when you’re in tablet mode and try to put it to sleep, you just can’t. My favorite is the one where you open an app, and it just sits there flickering on the screen, forever trapped closing and opening. Again, Google seems well aware of these problems, and most appear to be fixable bugs. I’ll revisit this review closer to the launch, and I hope the story gets better. Right now, if I use a Chromebook Pro like other Chromebooks—tabs not apps, and laptop not tablet—it works great. It’s a light, thin, long-lasting, slightly expensive Chromebook. That’s just a much smaller vision than what this thing could be. It should let me play Netflix on one side and keep my dinner recipe up on the other. It should let me check Instagram and Snapchat right next to my work email. I should be playing Candy Crush and Asphalt 8 while I’m pretending to work. Instead it’s still just a web browser. That’s frustrating, because the Chromebook Pro was supposed to be the shape-shifting future of computing, Google’s answer to everything from the iPad Pro to the Surface Studio. It was supposed to be the first Chromebook that made no compromises, that was both secure and powerful, fast and feature-rich. Android apps and Chrome OS were a match made in heaven, a perfect way for smartphone owners to get into the laptop world. The hardware’s there: Samsung proved you can make the right kind of laptop at an attractive price, and I hope every other PC manufacturer is taking notes. But on the software side, it’s clearly unfinished. Luckily, you get to wait and see if Google fixes the Pro’s many problems. I’ll be back here to let you know how that goes. But for right now, know this: the dream of the just-right Chromebook is alive inside this machine, but it’s still just out of reach. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Review Samsung Chromebook Pro review: Android apps steal the show, bugs and all Ken Yeung@thekenyeung February 10, 2017 6:00 AM Tags: Google, Google Chromebook, Samsung, Samsung Chromebook, Samsung Chromebook Plus, Samsung Chromebook Pro, Samsung Chromebook Pro Review, Samsung Google, top-stories Above: Samsung's Chromebook Pro laptop provides high-performance power and support for Android apps. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Back in 2012, Google launched the first Chromebook laptop produced by Samsung. Five years later, the next-generation models have arrived, complete with modern-day features creators should find appealing and native Google Play app support. That’s right, you can run Android programs on a laptop now — or at least that’s Google’s intention. Samsung and Google introduced the Chromebook Plus and Pro to the world at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. VentureBeat reviewed the latter device over the past two weeks, finding that the performance was exceptional and the Chromebook itself very useful for those who value productivity, high quality, and affordability. Another selling point was the Google Play store and the way apps would run on the Chromebook. Although this holds promise, initial reviews found downloaded apps to be buggy and not as responsive as hoped. Google acknowledged these issues and said that when the Google Play store exits beta at the end of April, the problems will be resolved. Above: The first Samsung Chromebook (left) and the Chromebook Pro (right). Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat That said, both new Chromebooks are going on sale before then, with the Plus hitting store shelves on February 12 for $449 and the Pro available on March 1 for $549. Even though the Chromebook Pro is a great laptop, there are some things to consider in the short term. The power of the Chromebook Pixel, but cheaper “We worked for many years to bring the vision of a Chromebook to life,” explained Samsung product specialist Adam Coon. “We really wanted to drive home the innovation piece for Samsung and we wanted to deliver with the next generation of Chromebooks.” The Samsung Chromebook Pro is geared toward people who want to be productive both at their desk and on the go. Everything about it is intended to provide a “premium customer experience” — akin to Google’s Chromebook Pixel, which was discontinued last year — and to illustrate that you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars on a top-of-the-line laptop. A convertible laptop, the Chromebook Pro has a 12.3-inch 2400×1600 Quad HD touch panel display that rotates 360 degrees. The experience of watching movies, making video calls, or playing games on the device is pretty good. While our review unit has a silver metal magnesium alloy chassis, the final version will be in a black shade. Weighing 2.38 lbs, the Chromebook Plus and Pro are both among the lightest Chrome OS devices on the market. By comparison, the Chromebook Pixel 2 was 3.3 lbs, the HP Chromebook 13 weighs 2.86 lbs, the Haier Chromebook 11 is 2.54 lbs, the Hisense Chromebook is 3.3 lbs, the Dell Chromebook 13 comes in at 3 lbs, and the Acer C731 Chromebook weighs 2.98 lbs. Above: The Samsung Chromebook Pro Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Samsung and Google have equipped the Chromebook Pro with an Intel Core m3 processor, while its sibling, the Chromebook Plus, comes with an OP1 hexa-core ARM processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 39Wh battery Samsung says will last nearly eight hours. Fast charging is not available, and it took about an hour to fully charge an empty battery. Installed on the device are an accelerometer and a gyroscope, two sensors you’d normally find on mobile devices, along with a port for 1 microSD card, 2 USB-C ports, and a 720p high-definition camera. And yes, there is a headphone jack. The audio quality is satisfactory, but it could certainly be much better. There are times when I’ve watched YouTube videos at maximum volume and felt they should be even louder, which is a little surprising because the Chromebook Pro includes two tiny speakers on the bottom of the keyboard. It didn’t take long to get used to using the keyboard and trackpad, as the layout is similar to many other Chromebooks. This isn’t the first time Chromebooks have featured a touch screen — the Chromebook Pixel and Asus Chromebook Flip are just two other examples. However, the Samsung Chromebook Pro includes a stylus that lets you interact and draw on the screen as you would with pen and paper. The stylus mirrors that of the S-Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note7, but it doesn’t include a button along the stem of the instrument. Coon said the stylus uses the same core technology as the smartphone pen. There’s also digitizer and palm rejection technology to reduce the chance of accidental drawings, smudges, or other activity if the screen is touched by a hand other than the one holding the stylus. Above: A look at the different parts of the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat What’s similar to the Note7 is that the Chromebook Pro includes a slot that stores the stylus when you’re not using it. After dislodging it from the compartment, the computer will automatically show a menu of stylus tools on the screen. You can capture a region or the screen, create a new note, and turn on the laser pointer mode or magnifying glass. In tablet mode, the stylus is useful as a mouse for drawing or web browsing, jotting down notes, or composing a document. “Writing on glass screens isn’t natural,” said Alex Kuscher, a senior product manager at Google. “We worked with Samsung to increase friction so it feels like writing on paper, more natural.” Indeed, using the stylus did feel like you were holding an actual pencil. When the Chromebook is in laptop mode, typing makes sense. But when in tablet mode, it might be faster to write out what you want. There is pressure sensitivity, so how hard you push against the screen can determine the brush or point weight. I tried using at least two other stylus-like instruments on the Chromebook screen, but those didn’t work. So if you lose the pen, you’ll have to purchase a replacement — how much that will be has yet to be released. Above: Samsung Chromebook Pro includes a stylus that gives creators a lot of flexibility in their work. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Unlike previous Chromebooks, Google is not offering a Google Drive promotion for those who purchase the Samsung Chromebook Plus or Pro. But at least with a microSD card slot, there’s room for expandable storage. After spending a few days with the Samsung Chromebook Pro, the appearance, specifications, and capabilities remind me of the Galaxy Note7 smartphone, in that it’s a powerful productivity device (sans exploding battery and mass recall). Chrome meets Android At first glance, you might wonder what really makes the Chromebook Plus and Pro stand out, as their noteworthy internal specifications aren’t exactly game-changers. A big selling point is that they’re built from the ground up to work with the Android apps that were announced at the 2016 Google I/O conference and began rolling out in September. Now, instead of needing duplicate apps, you can run the same apps on your mobile device as on a Chromebook. Above: Onboarding screen when you first use the Google Play store on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Some laptops have been able to run a beta version of the Google Play store, and our review unit was no different. As I tried out Android apps on the Chromebook, there were some serious bugs, such as an unresponsive app, being unable to enter in text or apply any input, and random crashes. Again, all these incidents were reported to Google, which promises they will all be eliminated by late April, when the Google Play store publicly launches. The organization could use some work, though, because both Chrome and Android apps are merged into a single section on the Chromebook, which can make things a bit more complicated when you have two of the same apps, such as Google Docs. This is similar to the experience VentureBeat’s Jordan Novet had with the Asus Chromebook Flip. Right now, the only way to immediately distinguish which one is Chrome-based is by looking to see if the app icon has a small Chrome logo in the lower right-hand side. Grouping is supported, so if things get too cluttered you can piece apps together by category. Above: Screenshot of the Google Play store on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Because the display is larger than a smartphone, Android apps on the Chromebook are window-sized by default. They can be resized to maximize the screen real estate, but not all apps will necessarily work when resized. Google Assistant is not supported on either Samsung Chromebook. App performance Unfortunately, some programs couldn’t be downloaded through the Play Store, including Periscope, WhatsApp, Uber Eats, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay (it can be installed but cards cannot be added). Below are some of the apps that I tested and my experience with them. Uber The app works as intended, but there are some glitches with its appearance, depending on how you’re using the computer. When the Chromebook is in laptop mode, the app will take up the entire screen; if it’s minimized and revisited, it will appear as a window tile. But when you convert the device to a tablet, Uber maximizes to fill the entire screen and is optimized for portrait mode. What makes this app compelling is that you don’t have to switch between computer and phone to request a pickup. Instagram Above: Instagram as seen on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Facebook brings all the features you’re used to on Instagram to the Chromebook. You can browse through your feed and Instagram Stories using the stylus, by touch, or using the trackpad, though the first two methods make using the app significantly easier. You can also explore, view notifications, and check out your profile. And if you’re so inclined, you can post photos to Instagram using images you’ve stored locally on the Chromebook Pro or take a selfie, which is basically what you’re limited to because the computer doesn’t have a rear-facing camera. Slack Slack is available on many operating systems, including the web, iOS, and Android, and as a desktop app. However, for Chrome OS, you’d have to use the web interface, since a native version hasn’t been released yet. But now that the Chromebook Pro supports the Android app, it’s more seamless. When I tried Slack on the computer it didn’t show up as a vertical tile, like a standard app, instead it appeared more like the desktop version. Snapchat Above: Logging into Snapchat resulted in an error on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot With a high-definition camera at your disposal, why not take advantage of Snapchat? Unfortunately, when testing out the app on the Chromebook Pro, I couldn’t even log in — every time I tried, I received an error saying the “login temporarily failed, so please try again later.” It didn’t appear to be a user error, because I was able to successfully log into my account on my iPhone. Quip Quip was one of the apps that I had some difficulty using. It looked like it would function as it normally does, but then I would suddenly be unable to select where the cursor should go or even type anything into my documents. The only way to remedy this was to restart the app. But aside from this glaring bug, which may be attributed to the Google Play store being in beta, Quip operates just like it would on an Android device. Facebook Above: How the Android app version of Facebook looks when in tile form on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot Facebook’s app provided a less-than-stellar experience, at least visually. When used, it appears full-screen, with just the News Feed (and sans any advertising and other modules that would normally appear in the right-hand sidebar). But when you reduce the size of the app, everything gets horribly compressed, and it becomes difficult to use. However, because it’s an Android app, if you convert the Chromebook Plus into tablet mode, it becomes tolerable. Overall, I felt using Facebook on the web provides a better experience than going through the Android app on Chromebook. Asphalt 8 Gaming is one category where having a tablet comes in handy. Because the Chromebook Pro has an accelerometer and gyroscope, there’s now a bigger screen that you can be entertained on. Asphalt 8 is a car racing game, and while the graphics are beautiful on the screen, it can be a bit unwieldy. And gripping on a large screen can be a bit of a hassle. Every now and then, I found myself accidentally pressing the task window bar in the Chrome OS menu bar with the palm of my hand. To solve this, I hid the menu bar, but it would be great if developers prevented this from showing up as you use the app. Asphalt 8 also had some bugs in it, specifically some latency in responsiveness after tapping a button when in game mode. Like with Quip, I had to restart the app to get it working again. One feature that I was surprised to find missing was the game launcher mode that has become a staple of the Samsung Galaxy smartphone series. Since you’re playing Android-based games, it’s strange that Samsung didn’t include its power save mode, allow you to hide alerts, take screenshots, or record your gameplay to share on YouTube or Facebook later on. Adobe Lightroom Above: Adobe Lightroom on Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Screenshot After Samsung announced that the Chromebook Plus and Pro would support Android apps, Adobe revealed that its Creative Cloud apps would be available on Chromebooks. I installed Adobe Lightroom and was happy with the experience. Unlike other programs, there were no glitches when editing photos. You can add photos from an attached camera, local storage, or from a microSD card. And there are a variety of ways to interact with Lightroom, either by touch — like you would on an Android device — or using the track pad or the stylus. Netflix The Chromebook Pro is intended for media consumption, so I looked at how Netflix would perform. The quality of the images is really good and so is the audio quality. Any latency issues were not apparent. Videos will play in landscape mode, even when in tablet mode. Plants vs. Zombies Heroes If you’re a fan of the Plants vs. Zombies game, you’ll be happy to know that you won’t have to play them through a Chrome extension on the Chromebook Pro. You can play Plants vs. Zombies in either laptop or tablet mode, but it’s optimized for the latter. Game play felt like you were on a smartphone or Android tablet instead of a computer. Art Canvas Above: Using the stylus in the ArtCanvas app on the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat An obvious use case for the stylus is drawing, and Art Canvas is just one of the Android apps you can illustrate on. As mentioned earlier, the instrument offers pressure sensitivity, so the harder you press on the screen, the heavier the brush. And with palm rejection, you won’t have to worry about smudging your work by resting your hand on the screen. Google Hangouts Google Hangouts works fine on the Chromebook Pro — you can send messages and make video calls. Having a 720p high-definition webcam provides good video quality for chats you might have with family, friends, coworkers, and clients. GBoard and third-party keyboards While you’re able to select different keyboards within Chrome, Google doesn’t allow you to install and use third-party apps, and shockingly this includes GBoard, which had an Android app as of last December. But even though alternate keyboards aren’t currently supported, there are plans to do so in the future, according to a Google spokesperson. Buy or pass? After my test, I’m going to have to say that the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a good laptop to have, especially for those who want powerful performance while on the go and the support of Android apps. There are a few issues that may dissuade people, but they’re related to the Google Play store, and since it’s still in beta, it’s somewhat understandable. However, not having these things smoothed out before the new Chromebooks go on sale is a bummer. The bugs referenced previously are not necessarily deal breakers, as the benefits the Samsung Chromebook Pro offers outweigh the issues that Google already said it’s fixing, and which will likely result in additional updates from developers. When traveling, I often take my MacBook Air, my phone, and my Nexus 7 tablet, each serving different purposes. The laptop is so I can continue working remotely while browsing the web and storing photos and files on a hard drive — we all know there are occasions when a laptop is called for. The tablet is so I can catch up on reading while watching movies and engaging in entertainment without sacrificing the battery on my phone. And, of course, the phone is for all my other activities — such as posting on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter, and listening to music. Above: VentureBeat’s Ken Yeung uses the Samsung Chromebook Pro in tablet mode. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat But now that I have the Chromebook Pro, I can leave the tablet behind. The form factor of a convertible laptop is sufficient for all my needs, and it’s likely that additional Android app-supported Chromebooks will enter the market soon. In order to ensure maximum user satisfaction, it would behoove Google and manufacturers like Samsung to allow developers to optimize their apps around these laptops and to take advantage of functionality such as the stylus. There is a lot of potential in this stylish and premium Chromebook. It may well give the iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface Book some competition, and you won’t have to break the bank to get it.

As businesses start to look seriously into making use of AI, platforms such as Microsoft’s Cognitive Services and Alexa from Amazon will become increasingly used to develop new applications. Both companies are looking at how to make artificial intelligence more widely available to developers. Microsoft unveiled three tools for developers, which it said would enable people unfamiliar with machine learning to power their applications with AI. Microsoft said its ambition was to democratise AI and make it accessible for all. This is the term CEO Satya Nadella used in January at the World Economic Forum. “Both the state I was born in in India and the state I now live in in the United States are using statistical machine learning to improve high school outcomes and use scarce state resources smartly,” said Nadella during a panel discussion. “That, to me, is democratising AI.” AI tools for developers Microsoft has already made the AI technology behind its Skype Translator, Bing and Cortana available to third-party applications through Microsoft Cognitive Services – a collection of 25 tools which allow developers to add features like emotion detection, vision and speech recognition and language understanding to their applications. Microsoft has now extended this with the three tools Custom Speech Service, Content Moderator and the Bing Speech API. Read more about AI adoption SEB bank is currently integrating AI into its customer services channels, following an internal trial of the technology. Retailers are beginning to explore how cognitive computing and AI could make e-commerce smarter and more personalised. Custom Speech Service offers developers speech recognition technology which Microsoft claimed can work accurately in noisy environments, and cope with jargon, dialects and accents. Content Moderator provides a way for users to quarantine and review data, such as images, text or videos, and filter out unwanted material, such as potentially offensive language or pictures. The third tool, Bing Speech API, can be used to convert spoken audio into text, or text into audio, and it understands intent. “Cognitive Services is about taking all of the machine learning and AI smarts that we have in this company and exposing them to developers through easy-to-use APIs [application programming interfaces], so that they don’t have to invent the technology themselves,” said Mike Seltzer, a principal researcher in the speech and dialogue research group at Microsoft’s research lab in Redmond. Custom Speech Service makes use of an algorithm that shifts Microsoft’s existing speech recogniser to developer-supplied data. By starting from models that have been trained on massive troves of data, the amount of application-specific data required is greatly reduced. In cases where the developer’s data is insufficient, the recogniser falls back on the existing models, said Microsoft. “The basic idea is that the more focused the systems can be, the better they will perform,” said Seltzer. “The job of the Custom Speech Service is to let you focus the system on the data that you care about.” Amazon targets UK Alexa developers Amazon is also expanding its developer support for Alexa, the online retailer’s AI-based voice recognition and speech service with availability of the Alexa Skills Kit in Europe. This will help developers create so-called “Alexa skills”, apps for Alexa. According to Amazon, European brands planning to integrate Alexa into their applications include JustEat, the BBC, The Guardian, Jamie Oliver, MyTaxi, Hive, Netatmo, National Rail and Deutsche Bahn. John Rakowski, director of technology strategy at application monitoring firm AppDynamics, said: “Early iterations of Amazon Alexa pairings have included a voice-activated radio and in-car assistant, which gives some idea of its use cases. However, this is only the beginning. The fact it can be featured within other devices will allow users to give voice commands without having a dedicated device in every room. It also opens up the possibility of use in specialised sectors such as manufacturing, where niche solutions are needed.” Gartner research vice-president Bettina Tratz-Ryan predicted that AI would allow internet of things-enabled machines to learn to become expert operators. Industrial use of AI could lead to greater flexibility and customisation in manufacturing. For instance, an industrial company would be able to understand the reason a particular raw material is being purchased, which would then enable it to offer individualised product manufacturing. Retailers such as Yoox Net-a-Porter Group are assessing how AI, using IBM Watson, could be deployed to make e-commerce more intuitive. One of the AI application areas retailers are considering is the use of chatbots to reduce the volume of queries human customer care staff handle, allowing them to deal with more complex customer service enquiries. Using AI for automation Steve Hewitt, head of retail at Capgemini, said many retailers are looking at chatbots to provide more intuitive access to data. AI is also being used to automate metadata, which is important both for internal and external internet searches. In the banking sector, AI is also being used for back office automation, customer service and fraud detection. Swedish bank SEB, for instance, used IPSoft’s Amelia AI engine to automate four IT processes: unlocking a user account, password guidance, unlocking a customer mortgage account and a more general guide to help internal users find an IT service. In healthcare, DeepMinds, the artificial intelligence company owned by Google, is also expanding its AI work. At the end of 2016, the company announced it had begun work with Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to investigating the opportunity for mobile clinical applications to improve care. Intel has also joined the efforts to make AI easier for developers to start using, with the introduction of its deep learning library, BigDL, which it claims will make AI training and tools broadly accessible to developers through the Intel Nervana AI Academy. BigDL is a distributed deep learning library built on the Spark architecture. It makes deep learning more accessible to big data users and data scientists. Developers can write deep learning applications as standard Spark programs that run on top of existing Spark or Hadoop clusters to put deep learning workloads more directly in touch with the data they use. BigDL is already running in the Databricks Spark Platform. Unlike traditional programming, where a set of instructions are followed by the computer to achieve a particular objective, AI systems are taught using masses of data. When presented with new information, the AI uses pattern matching to make a best guess of what the data means. AI represents a different way of thinking about computing, and the industry will need to work at getting developers to think differently about how to solve problems in AI. Amazon is holding an event in London on 15-16 February, focusing on Alexa. This is just the start, and the tech giants are beginning to look at tackling the knowledge barrier to entry.

Uber is a FASTR founding member. (Angelo Merendino / AFP) Relaxnews Published Friday, February 10, 2017 7:52AM EST Self-driving vehicles will remain a technological curiosity unless consumers can be convinced they're safe from hackers as well as simply safe on the road. Real-world testing and ongoing pilot schemes will eventually ensure that a car equipped with an array of sensors and other devices really can be trusted when it comes to the act of driving -- but what about cyber security? How can we be sure that our autonomous cars won't be hacked and our data stolen, or worse still have their controls taken over by cyber criminals and used for evil? After all, a number of high-profile demonstrations have already highlighted a host of cyber-shortcomings in current-generation connected cars. And, by 2020, it's conservatively estimated that there will be 250 million connected cars on the world's roads. This is where the Future of Automotive Security Research (FASTR) comes in. A non-profit consortium created by Intel and Uber among others that wants to get everyone involved in creating the next generation of cars to help develop and follow the same cybersecurity protections and guidelines. "The connected and autonomous car of the future offers revolutionary benefits: dramatic reduction in accidents, alleviation of city congestion, mobility for all and more. All of the benefits will rely on non-negotiable automotive security," said Steve Grobman, FASTR board president and Intel Security Group chief technology officer. FASTR has published a manifesto which should be seen as a call to action and an invitation to all to combine their expertise and offer open-source, neutral solutions to what is going to be a growing threat. "FASTR creates an environment that fosters collaboration and data exchange among the public and private sectors to drive toward a unified and global response to cyber hacks through the development of industry best practices, model response systems, protocols, vendor-neutral inputs to emerging standards and R&D resources," said Ami Dotan, Karamba Security CEO and FASTR member.

President Donald Trump may be poised to order the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend a 2010 rule requiring companies to disclose whether they use conflict minerals. That’s according to an apparent leaked draft of a presidential directive obtained earlier this week by The Intercept. Publications including Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the document. But sources the news agency contacted said the Trump administration is prepared to instruct the SEC to suspend the rule for two years. The rule, which is often known as Section 1502 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, instructs companies that report to the SEC to share information about their procurement of metals and minerals including tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten. Such disclosure is mandatory if those materials are “necessary to the functionality or production” of a product contracted for, or manufactured by, a company. The rule was designed to discourage companies from buying these materials from countries notorious for human rights violations, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo. NGOs and human rights activists often hailed the rule as a way for companies to source raw materials more sustainably and responsibly. But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the legislation. Most of the regulations were upheld after a 2015 ruling, though companies no longer have to designate products as “not been found to be DRC conflict free” due to that federal court’s interpretation of the First Amendment. But according to Global Witness, an NGO that has long campaigned against corruption and human rights abuses in central Africa, the vast majority of the companies subjected to Dodd-Frank disclosures are not meeting the minimum requirements of the law. The leaked document was released days before Trump met with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who later announced the company will build a $7 billion plant in Arizona that would employ as many as 3,000 workers. To some, such as Slate writer Jordan Weissmann points out, the meeting is part of a new corporate strategy to credit Trump with investment in jobs, whether or not the White House had anything to do with new plant openings or hiring. Intel is one of many large technology companies that lobbied Congress while Dodd-Frank was debated before its 2010 passage. After Dodd-Frank become law, Intel pledged to ensure that its supply chain is “conflict free,” although investigations of Congo’s metal industry found that conditions in Congo have at the most only improved slightly. Meanwhile, industry groups keep complaining that the cost of compliance is far too high. The proposed suspension of Section 1502 should come as no surprise considering Trump’s rhetoric during the presidential campaign. While the legislation was passed as a response to the 2008-2009 global financial meltdown, Trump is on the record saying he wants to “do a big number” on Dodd-Frank — claiming it makes it nearly impossible for small- and medium-sized businesses, including his “friends,” to access credit. But other analysts say that while smaller banks have struggled due to the more restrictive rules on issuing mortgages and commercial loans, such legislation was necessary to prevent the excesses that led to the near collapse of the U.S. financial sector. Finally, while the implementation of Section 1502 has been far from perfect, it at a minimum raised awareness of the corruption and environmental disaster resulting from the conflict minerals trade. And that ground gained may now be at risk.

By Elsa Buchanan February 10, 2017 11:49 GMT Close DRC: Breaking Congo's conflict mining curse IBTimes UK Human rights campaigners have expressed fears that US President Donald Trump's administration may suspend a rule that requires companies to disclose whether their products contain "conflict minerals" from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), that either directly or indirectly benefits armed groups. On 8 February, Reuters reported Trump was planning to issue a directive targeting the controversial rule nestled in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which requires listed companies, including Apple, Intel, HP and Tiffany & Co, to report annually on their conflict minerals supply chain examination process. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it was "concerned" about the potential suspension of the order for two years, saying the move would "undermine" positive efforts to eliminate conflict minerals from the supply chains of major companies. "All these steps would undermine positive efforts to eliminate conflict minerals from the supply chains of major companies, which is vital since the trade in conflict minerals has helped enrich abusive armed groups in Congo and neighbouring countries," HRW said in a statement on Friday (10 February). The term "conflict minerals" is used to describe raw materials, such as gold, tungsten, tantalum and tin, that are mined in areas where fighting or human rights abuses take place. The illicit trade in these critical minerals used as key components in the electronics, jewellery and aerospace industries has helped enrich abusive armed groups in Congo and neighbouring countries. Local armed groups fighting for the control of gold mines and trading routes in Congo have allegedly committed war crimes and crimes against humanity using the profits from gold to fund their activities and buy weapons. Battle for control of the DRC: Who are the armed groups killing for land, resources and ethnicity? As reported by IBTimes UK, there has recently been a surge in attacks committed by armed group Allied Democratic Forces, known as ADF-Nalu on villages in North Kivu. According to witnesses and survivors, the warlords carried out summary executions and abuses against civilians, forcing thousands to flee as they sought to exploit natural resources under the North Kivu's fertile ground. Civilians have been either forced or tricked into working in illicit mines. "If the Trump administration wants to 'drain the swamp,' it makes no sense to undermine companies trying to keep money out of the hands of abusive thugs," said Arvind Ganesan, business and human rights director at HRW. "Leading companies have embraced the rule and proven that it works." The law, known as Dodd-Frank 1502, was passed in 2010 and implemented in 2014. Check out our Flipboard magazine - Who's who in the battle for DRC by IBTimes UK In this series on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, IBTimes UK takes a closer look at the eastern regions of South and North Kivu where civilians are still at the mercy of armed groups and the Congolese armed forces, who have all been accused of committing serious war crimes.

Real-world testing and ongoing pilot schemes will eventually ensure that a car equipped with an array of sensors and other devices really can be trusted when it comes to the act of driving — but what about cyber security? How can we be sure that our autonomous cars won’t be hacked and our data stolen, or worse still have their controls taken over by cyber criminals and used for evil? After all, a number of high-profile demonstrations have already highlighted a host of cyber-shortcomings in current-generation connected cars. And, by 2020, it’s conservatively estimated that there will be 250 million connected cars on the world’s roads. This is where the Future of Automotive Security Research (FASTR) comes in. A non-profit consortium created by Intel and Uber among others that wants to get everyone involved in creating the next generation of cars to help develop and follow the same cybersecurity protections and guidelines. “The connected and autonomous car of the future offers revolutionary benefits: dramatic reduction in accidents, alleviation of city congestion, mobility for all and more. All of the benefits will rely on non-negotiable automotive security,” said Steve Grobman, FASTR board president and Intel Security Group chief technology officer. FASTR has published a manifesto which should be seen as a call to action and an invitation to all to combine their expertise and offer open-source, neutral solutions to what is going to be a growing threat. “FASTR creates an environment that fosters collaboration and data exchange among the public and private sectors to drive toward a unified and global response to cyber hacks through the development of industry best practices, model response systems, protocols, vendor-neutral inputs to emerging standards and R&D resources,” said Ami Dotan, Karamba Security CEO and FASTR member. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Mopar makes its mark on the Dodge Challenger Toyota launches sporty new SUVs Five reasons why this Porsche is not quite the hybrid you expect Can FASTR speed up consumer confidence in autonomous cars?

The flight was organised by Belle Moore, a student of Alexandra College Junior School, Milltown, as part of her research for a project on drones for the Intel Mini Scientist Competition. The historic flight took place on Saturday, January 28 at 5pm in Dun Laoghaire. It took just two minutes to complete, from take-off to parcel drop, with the drone taking the parcel, weighing 250 grams, from the shoreline to a boat almost 200 metres away at sea. The parcel contained medical supplies including an emergency thermal blanket, an Epi-pen, bandages, plasters, thermometer, first aid leaflet, gloves, wipes and burn dressings. It also contained food and a drink in the form of a high-energy bar, and water. The supplies were attached to the underside of the drone in a waterproof container. The IAA helped Belle with her research by providing her with details on the safety regulations for drone flight in Ireland.  “I am thrilled to have been part of today’s new record flight,” Belle said. “I am very grateful to all of the Pony Express clients who completed my survey, the staff of Pony Express Couriers, First Direct Medical Couriers, FDS Worldwide, Ralph James and Niall Cummins of the IAA, Captain Gearóid O’Briain of FlyRyte and everyone else who have been so generous with their time and information.” She also received advice from Matthew Sweeny, the CEO and Co-Founder of Flirtey, the company that performed the first FAA approved parcel delivery by drone in America. “We’re delighted with the success of the first official parcel delivery in Ireland via drone,” said Ralph James, the IAA’s Director of Safety Regulation. “This was carried out under controlled conditions which met all regulatory requirements. “The application of drone technology is vast and the IAA will continue to foster, promote and encourage its use with the emphasis, as always, on safety.” Mr James added: “A significant amount of research is taking place all over the world to design systems that will enable drones to safely integrate with manned aviation. Drone delivery systems is one such application. Whatever procedures are introduced in the future must guarantee the safety of manned aviation and the safety of people on the ground in urban areas. “We’d like to congratulate Belle on her great achievement and say well done to all in involved.” Also helping Belle with her research and the flight were FlyRyte Drone Academy who train commercial drone pilots in Ireland. Gearóid Ó Briain, Head of Training at FlyRyte, helped Belle by controlling the delivery drone. Ireland was the first country in the world to introduce mandatory registration for all drones over 1kg. There are now over 6,000 drones and model aircraft registered with the IAA and the number continues to grow. Dublin’s largest courier company, Pony Express Couriers, helped with the logistics of the flight and have been helping Belle with her research by providing data on current parcel delivery methods in Dublin. Though Pony Express Couriers, who were the first courier company in Ireland, are not planning on offering a drone parcel delivery service in Dublin any time soon, they are keen to be at the leading edge of all new developments in the sector.  “We were delighted to be involved in Ireland’s first drone parcel delivery,” said Audrey Browne, Operations Manager of Pony Express. “And we’re proud that we, as an Irish company, are trialling the technology. “We enjoyed working alongside Belle, giving her advice and learning from her at the same time. We wish her the best of luck in the Intel Mini Scientist Competition.” Belle presented her report ‘Using Drones to Deliver Parcels in Dublin: A Feasibility Study’, at the Grand Finals of the Intel Mini Scientist Competition in the Helix in DCU last Friday.

Tequilla billionaires reap windfall Eco-warrior lays waste to Philippines' mining industry Gordhan says Oakbay hounded him business report technology Beware of Trump wrath via Twitter Technology / 10 February 2017, 07:16am Bloomberg US President Donald Trump’s presidency by now has established a familiar pattern in his dealings with companies: do what Trump wants, or face a presidential rebuke. Photo: Bloomberg Washington - President Donald Trump is injecting himself into the daily business of US companies to an unprecedented extent, spurring investors and executives to weigh their exposure to his wrath when making decisions. The latest was Nordstrom, which drew Trump’s public anger on Twitter on Wednesday for discontinuing his daughter Ivanka’s line, saying sales had slumped. Trump shot back, first from his personal account, then re-tweeted from his official @POTUS account: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person - always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The tweet initially sent Nordstrom’s shares down slightly before they rebounded and ended the day up 4percent, the biggest daily gain in two months. Two hours after attacking the department store, Trump hosted Intel Corporation chief executive Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office to announce that the semiconductor-maker would spend $7billion (R94.06bn) on a factory in Chandler, Arizona, creating 3000 jobs - a move that was already widely expected by investors and did little to boost shares. Once again, Trump took to Twitter. “A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst,” he wrote. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Not even three weeks into Trump’s presidency, the moves fit a familiar pattern in his dealings with companies: do what Trump wants, or face a presidential rebuke. This direct, company-by- company intervention is forcing chief executives and corporate boards into a choice they have never before faced with a sitting president - are we with him, or against him? - in a way that distorts normal decision-making and conflicts with shareholder interests. Holding back “There are some firms that are invariably going to hold back their punches; they are holding back certain announcements or decisions, because this is a time of uncertainty,” said Mohan Tatikonda, a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. “On the other hand, there are firms that are taking advantage of the climate,” he said. “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” Some choose to fight. Technology companies Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and others have emerged as vocal critics of Trump’s immigration executive order. Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz on the weekend Trump’s immigration order was enacted wrote that he had a “heavy heart” and that the coffee chain plans to hire 10000 refugees over five years around the world. Read also: How smart money can survive the Trump era United Technologies cancelled plans to shutter an Indianapolis factory in its Carrier unit and agreed to trim the number of jobs it would send to Mexico after Trump’s complaints. Even so, the company will still move hundreds of jobs, while receiving a $7million incentive package from Indiana in exchange for the operations that will remain. Discussing issues Yesterday, Trump was to meet at the White House with the chief executives of US airlines to discuss regulatory issues, taxes and infrastructure improvements at airports. He met last week with pharmaceutical companies, and in the first week of his presidency with car makers. Lockheed Martin and Boeing, both targets by Trump over the costs of military aircraft, have pledged to work with the new administration to keep spending in check, without divulging specific details. The moves have given Trump public victories even as it is unclear whether any aspect of the companies’ government contracts has changed.

I'd rather have 192 Cores for the same amount of money: Or do you perhaps prefer twice that? 380 cores? well yeah but those 192 cores will be 3120 tdp 6 of those i5's will be 390 tdp for 24 cores the 24 core has 164 assuming you could find a motherboard that can take the 4 i5's still often server rack cases have limited cooling although i do not believe that in it's life time the lower tdp will save on the electricity bill !actually let's do the math 24x 164=3936 and 24x390 =9360 llet's asume an average electricity cost of 15 cents per kwhatt hour 3.94x0.15 =0.591 usd a day 9.36x0.15 =1.404 usd a day so 0.813 extra usd per 24 hours 183x6= 1098 the cost of the i5's 8898-1098 = 7800 so 7800/0,813= 9594 days just to break even ! or 26.29 years ! so there you have it in 26.29 years you will get your money back threw the electricity bill ! assuming you run all the cores 24/7/365 at 100% at all times !

I wonder what will happen when this: http://www.guru3d.com/news-story/amd...rs-photos.html will hit the server market. I have a feeling customers will push for AMD hardware because it will be cheaper and provide more cores per socket. Right now, i administer vmware infrastructures for a lot of big companies all over the world thorough the company i work for. We never provided AMD platforms. The Dell, Fujitsu, Cisco, HP or Bull esxi hosts are all Intel based.

I don't think you will have to wait 10 years for that tbh.     isidore View Public Profile Find all posts by isidore   (#15) Neo Cyrus Ancient Guru     Videocard: Gigabyte 970 G1 Processor: i7-4770K @ 4.4GHz Mainboard: ASRock Z97 Extreme6 Memory: 16GB 2400 10-12-12-31 Soundcard: ZxR + Beyerdynamic DT 990 PSU: Antec High Current 900W 02-09-2017, 22:18 | posts: 8,316 | Location: GTA, Canada Quote: Originally Posted by alanm In 10 years we'll be laughing at this as our $300 CPUs destroy it. It's 24 cores at 2.4GHz... in a few revisions AMD can pump out 16 core CPUs which outperform it due to higher clocks, if they really wanted. That wouldn't be $300 but it definitely can be done far before 10 years.     Neo Cyrus View Public Profile Find all posts by Neo Cyrus   (#16) Havel Master Guru     Videocard: 1070 Processor: 4770K Mainboard: ASUS Memory: 16GB Soundcard: AMD PSU: 750W 02-09-2017, 22:30 | posts: 328 I can buy a car for 9K.

AMD would need references of (reasonably) long-term stability and general troubleless runtime to attract customers. It's not just the Naples itself but also the board it's attached to. On the bright side, apparently the server owners have over the years got just as fed up with Intel's monopoly as everybody else, so in that sense the business world should be welcoming AMD as well, should they offer a good product.     Kaarme View Public Profile Find all posts by Kaarme   (#18) chronek Member Guru     Videocard: Geforce 980 GTX 4GB gddr5 Processor: Intel i7-4790k@5Ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte GA-Z97M-D3H Memory: GoodRam 32GB ddr3 Soundcard: SB ZxR, BD 990DT pro PSU: Chieftec 750W Yesterday, 00:10 | posts: 68 | Location: Poland hahaha crapy 2.4 ghz cpu with maybe 2 threads over 3 ghz for almost 9k i hope soon Amd show intel how to do it right and for smaller price Last edited by chronek; Yesterday at 00:13.     chronek View Public Profile Find all posts by chronek   (#19) N0Name Newbie   Videocard: GTX 970 Processor: i7-4770 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 630 Yesterday, 03:28 | posts: 2 That's what datacenter and render farms use ? ... not overclocked i3 These prices are nothing considering that sometimes developers / designers do earn more then this monthly.     N0Name View Public Profile Find all posts by N0Name   (#20) Zeka Newbie     Videocard: PowerColor R9 280 3GB Processor: i5 4690K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97-UD3H Memory: Kingston 1866 DDR3 8GB Soundcard: PSU: Corsair vx 550W Yesterday, 09:44 | posts: 25 Big datacenters that purchase this type of cpus worry more about TDP then about performance. Seeing that we have 8/16 core zen running at 65W tdp @ 3.7Ghz, I think Intel is worried and is at this point taking whatever they can before 32 core zen hits the market     Zeka View Public Profile Find all posts by Zeka   (#21) DeskStar Master Guru     Videocard: x4 eVGA GTX TITAN SC Processor: i7-3970x @ 4.5ghz 1.41v Mainboard: ASUS RIVE X79 Memory: 65gb G Skill RJ's @ 2133 Soundcard: Corsair Headset PSU: X3 1500watt PSU's Yesterday, 14:02 | posts: 183 | Location: MI This is sickening......simply sickening. Something needs to happen in this industry to shut down these scalpers..!.! Nothing is that more reliable/powerful to quantify this jump in pricing.

I have worked on a single computer that was worth $3 million. Regardless, it doesn't seem like a wise choice to buy. For anything massively parallel, GPUs are better. ARM is better when you want many individual small tasks.     schmidtbag View Public Profile Find all posts by schmidtbag « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.
