Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Business Laptops Galore: Which One Would You Go For? September 27, 2013, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts iPhone 8 Dummy Model Images Surface Upholding the Rumored Features Motorola Z2 Play will Apparently Have Minimal Design Revamps Are you in search of a laptop which would satisfy your needs as a businessman? If you are looking for one such notebook, the main aspects you would look for are portability as well as good battery life, right? If you buy a powerful notebook with amazing features and if it does not have a battery giving a long life, then what is the use? Here are some good suggestions for those who are in search of a business centric notebook. If your first preference for a business centric laptop is its portability and elegant looks,  you can choose the Macbook Air without any hesitation. The sleek design enables the user to carry the device inside his backpack without much trouble. The notebook has thickness less than 0.75 inch and comes with an 11 inch display and a backlit keyboard. The device comes with both 1.3 GHz Intel Dual Core i5 and 1.7 GHz Intel Dual Core i7 processors, and also features Intel HD Graphics 5000. Two USB 3.0 ports as well as a FaceTime HD camera for video calling are provided. Most importantly, the powerful battery of the device will provide life up to nine hours. In all senses, Macbook Air is a good choice for a professional. Durability is one of the most important factors in the case of a business laptop. Many companies are manufacturing their business class devices giving more importance to portability. The Dell Latitude E6430 ATG gives utmost importance to durability. The device has a strong aluminum lid and a magnesium alloy frame. The notebook is able to withstand dust and moisture, which makes it a good companion on the go. It comes with a powerful Intel Core i7 processor and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 chipset. This business laptop has a decent battery life of about eight hours. The Lenovo ThinkPad Helix hybrid business class device comes with a detachable keyboard and features an 11. 6 HD screen capable of playing even 1080p videos. This ultra portable device with touch screen display is one of the best choices for an executive who travels all the while. It features 8 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD as well as dual band Wi-Fi, and has a SIM card tray for 3G/4G connectivity also. The Sony Vaio Pro 13 Touch, in the meantime, is a 13 inch fourth generation business laptop that comes with a handful of features to satisfy the business user. This light weight device has weight just under 2.5 pounds, and features a 1080p HD touch screen display. The user can have option to choose either Intel core i5 or Intel core i7 processor. The device gives the user a more ergonomic typing experience than its rivals. The company claims that the device has a battery life of seven hours. So tell us which of these devices would you want to go for ? Tell us why too.

It seems now that Coffee Lake is alive as well. Intel Coffee results (well assumed Coffee lake SKUs) have shown up in the SiSoft Sandra Results database as wccftech spotted. The procs spotted ate embedded 4-core units and 6-core desktop parts. It is unclear when Intel will release Coffee Lake though as first the Sky and kaby Lake X procs will be released. Coffee Lake would be released together with the Z370 / H370 chipsets and logic assumes a release later this year in the Q4 region. Intel 300 series desktop processor motherboard would be based on the current LGA 1151 socket, and since the SiSoft results shows a Kaby lake Client Platform entry, it could very well be compatible with Socket 1151 motherboards. Earlier rumours stated that the 300 Series chipset's Coffee Lake-S processor will provide 6 Cores 12 threaded CPUS, which is Intel's first in the mainstream platform to enhance the number of processors and threads.  The 6-core part spotted in the Sandra data-base does not seem to have Hyper-threading enabled indicative of a Core i5 version, it’s clocked at a 3.5 GHz base clock frequency. There’s no mention of the Turbo clock frequency. The chip features 1.5 MB of L2 cache (6 x 256 KB) and 9 MB of L3 cache. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ...

They show a larger spread in performance. This is just a relevant as you comparing Broadwell to Coffee Lake. Also who is to say the bench run with the Coffee lake i5 is accurate the bench may not be utilizing the new CPU correctly for all we know. Best to wait till we see these chips in the wild.

Recent News Paradigm Persona Series Launched In Singapore – New Paradigm Of Perfection? The Ulefone Vienna (US$119) is a Budget Hi-Fi Enabled Budget Smartphone for Music Lovers The Meizu m2 Note is a Budget Phone that Appeals to Youths Lenovo Yoga Book review Oukitel K6000 Plus Smartphone Review: Unlimited Battery Life Wednesday, April 26, 2017 Latest News Smartphones Gaming Reviews Virtual Reality Prosumer Reviews for 22 million Enthusiasts Forums SGCafe Search for: Home > Android > Lenovo Yoga Book review AndroidLaptopsLenovoReviewsTablets and E-Readers Lenovo Yoga Book review James Seaton April 25, 20170173 The Lenovo Yoga Book is one of the most intriguing mobile devices we’ve seen in some time. In a market that’s seen an explosion in the number of 2 in 1 notebook/tablet hybrids, the Yoga Book really stands out. The concept is incredible. You can use it as a notebook and type on it, you can draw on it with a stylus, you can transfer written notes into text. And it’s tiny, with a 10.1″ screen, it weighs in at 690 grams and is less than 1cm thick! While the concept sounds amazing.. and it really is.. there are some caveats to consider when evaluating the Yoga Book. Read on to find out.   While the market has its fair share of notebook class 2 in 1’s, there’s next to nothing in the way of hybrids in the 10″ range. Lenovo has seen there is a real market here with this size and weight class being too large for smartphones and too small and thin for a relatively higher TDP processor. Enter the Lenovo Yoga Book. The first thing you notice when opening the beautifully crafted metal body is the lack of a keyboard. It’s also powered by an Intel Atom CPU, so it gives away some performance, but from this it gains very good battery life. We have an array of creativity based features such as a fully featured graphics tablet, stylus and handwriting to text functionality. Design At first glance, there’s no doubt the Lenovo Yoga Book is simply gorgeous. The Yoga Book comes with an all metal construction. Our sample came finished with a beautiful gunmetal grey which really does give a refined and classy look to the unit. Champagne gold and carbon black finishes are also available. Obviously it’s a 2 in 1 that can function as a tablet, in tent mode and of course as a laptop. Picture courtesy of Lenovo The screen is a 10.1″ 1920 x 1200 IPS panel. This means any 1080p content will have small black bars at the top and bottom, though in our opinion, the extra screen real estate more than makes up for that. Lenovo’s specs indicate the screen is capable of 70% of the color gamut, though it doesn’t say which one. While the screen appears to be perfectly acceptable to us in general usage, with typical IPS wide viewing angles, a high pixel density and enjoyable movie viewing, 70% is quite a low number and is something that should be considered a negative for artists and professionals who rely on color accuracy for their work. Given the target market for the device, we think this is something that needs to be improved if/when there is a Yoga Book 2. The speakers are surprisingly adequate. A thin and light device often compromises on sound, and while the speakers in the Yoga Book won’t win any sounds pressure contests or reproduce bass you can feel, they do a good job without too much brightness in the midrange which often plagues cheaper speakers. If you’re playing a movie in bed at night in tablet mode, the speakers will do the job. The Yoga Book comes with Lenovo’s excellent watchband hinge. The company has somehow managed to bring aesthetics and functionality to an otherwise overlooked aspect of notebook design. Many Lenovo models use this hinge including its premium lines so clearly the engineers have done a good job. Specifications The Yoga Book comes with the choice of either Android 6.0.1 (as our sample came equipped with) or Windows 10. Which one you choose will depend on your usage patterns. Both models are currently priced at $899 SGD. Other markets appear to have the Windows 10 version priced higher making the Singapore pricing quite good value at this time. The CPU powering the Yoga Book is a Intel Atom x5-Z8550 SoC. This is a Cherry Trail CPU that we’ll come right out and say is pretty average at best, with several ARM SoC’s beating the Atom handily. In fact Intel have struggled so much competing against ARM in the mobile SoC space that they have pulled the plug on the planned next generation Broxton range. Don’t bet against a Yoga Book 2 being powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with 802.11ad wi-fi and Bluetooth 5, running Windows 10 and therefore all the desktop class apps.. That sounds tasty..but we digress.. The I/O ports are very limited indeed. You get a single outdated Micro-b USB port for charging, single Type-D micro HDMI port, a headphone jack and slot for a micro SD and/or nano SIM card (which was absent from our test model). There’s also a power button and volume up/down button. Micro USB really should disappear in favor of USB Type-C. Ideally we want to see 2+ ports which would allow the unit to charge and have another USB device fitted at the same time. Right now with the Micro USB you’ll need an adapter to use pretty much any USB device at all. Other key features include 8 and 2 megapixel rear and front facing cameras, 4Gb of memory and 64Gb of onboard eMMC storage.   The Real Pen and Create Pad The Real Pen is a dual use stylus/pen accessory bundled with the Yoga Book. Impressively, it doesn’t require batteries. You can use it as a conductive pen or as an actual pen with ink. You can remove the stylus nib and replace it with real ink to use for the handwriting feature. Lenovo calls the bottom half of the Yoga Book, the ‘Create Pad’. This works in one of three ways. The first is the form of a graphics digitizer that works with the Real Pen. It is a full-blown, electromagnetic resonance (EMR) tablet, designed in partnership with Wacom, who know a thing or two about tablets. The second use allows the Yoga Book to take digital copies of hand created content at up to 1cm above its surface, such as you would have while writing on a notepad. It does not require special paper. First you must switch the stylus’ plastic nib to one of the included ink based nibs. The stylus and tablet interact via a electromagnetic field so the tablet knows where the pen is relative to the pad. At the same time the stylus provides a signal to let the computer know when it is being pressed against paper, so, as you write with the stylus, and the content appears on the paper, so too does it appear on the main screen. This is probably the most distinctive capability of the Yoga Book, and could be the device’s ‘killer app’. Students in particular may find this a great feature. The now for the third use: The Keyboard The Yoga Book comes equipped with a fully digital capacitive keyboard. It provides haptic feedback in the form of a buzz when each key is tapped. The keys are fixed cannot be changed. It looks beautiful, almost Star Trekkish and will definitely generate ooh’s and ahh’s from curious onlookers. While consumers generally have become more used to capacitive keyboards in the era of smartphones and tablets, there is a reason we still have physical keyboards. The problem is accuracy or lack thereof. I found myself making a great many typo errors during general usage and had to look at the keyboard more and more. On a regular keyboard with feedback, you can feel if you have made a mistake or hit the edge of an adjacent key. If you are more of a touch typist, you’ll find yourself looking at the screen and discovering your text is full of mistakes. The keyboard also has a problem with latency. If you are a fast typist, you may find the system is not capable of keeping up with you and the unit will be buzzing all the time as keystrokes are registered. The idea is very very cool, but it does need to be refined to better mimic the feel and usability of an actual keyboard. The Yoga Book would be more usable with a dedicated keyboard, and leave the drawing/writing part to the actual screen itself. The OS and Apps As mentioned, The Lenovo Yoga Book comes with a Android 6.0.1 and of course some Lenovo software to power the Yoga Book’s unique features. While it does the job well enough, its just not the same as a refined desktop OS. You notice it with the little things.. resizing windows, switching between tabs, the mouse control. Android still feels like a phone OS. With its intended stylus oriented functions, and general tasks, it does fine though. For the most part, Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) performs the same as its smartphone cousins. Things like the settings and application menu’s will be very familiar to users of Android phones, as will the swipe operations and general navigability.   In addition to the usual offerings from a Android device, there are links and shortcuts to a whole range of apps; Gmail, Docs, Maps, Drive, Play Store, it’s all there. Of course being a Lenovo product, the company has added it’s own apps to the basic OS. The File Manager is very much like what you’d see in a Windows file explorer. There’s also a couple of introduction apps designed to take first time users on a tour of the features and capabilities of the Yoga Book. These are worth a look for your first time poke around the system. The user manual is there too. Share it is Lenovo’s own cloud sharing solution, though with so much Google on tap, you might as just well use their cloud and sharing services.   Below is the Note Saver app. This app, along with the stylus is what you’d use to create irreplaceable works of art like the one you see below.   Below is a test of the handwriting feature. As mentioned above, inserting one of the ink nibs into the stylus and writing on ordinary paper on the create pad instantly digitizes the written handwriting into the note app. My handwriting is not exactly stunning, but the point was to write this as I would normally write.. fast and messy! This is actually a very accurate example of my handwriting indicating the system and stylus’ EM tracking is highly accurate. A student in a lecture would find this feature quite useful. Picture courtesy of Lenovo   Performance We didn’t spend too much time benchmarking the Yoga Book since we don’t have a lot of comparable hardware to compare with (with Android) In Geekbench 4, the system scores 1159 in the single core test and 3288 in the multi core test. These results really show the weakness of the Atom processor. A Samsung Galaxy S7 with Exynos processor scores 1806 and 5228 respectively. Obviously Lenovo wanted the Windows 10 option so they had little choice but to go with the Intel Atom, however, we hope for the next iteration of Yoga Book, Lenovo will consider a Windows 10/Snapdragon 835 SoC combo which will destroy the Atom in performance.   Battery life was quite excellent. Lenovo claims 13 hours per charge and we did our entire setup and testing on a single charge. Given our usage pattern, we’d estimate around 10 hours from fully charged to flat though your mileage may vary depending on the workload. 13 hours is not beyond the realms of possibility. Conclusion Right now the Yoga Book struggles to define itself. It’s far too under powered to be considered a laptop even with the resource thrifty Android OS. While the Windows version should be better when using the Yoga Book as a laptop, the Atom processor will feel even more sluggish. Android is still a smartphone OS at its heart and its abilities on a productivity oriented device reveal its shortfalls. Multitasking remains an issue with Android.  While you have apps like Photoshop Express and Office, they have their shortfalls compared to their PC brethren. With Windows and a beefier processor you can expect to have a browser with many tabs open, a spreadsheet, word processor, email app, a media player or stream of your sports team going all at the same time. Add Illustrator or Photoshop or a CAD program for a more specialized user and its clear Android just cannot do this yet. Are you an artist or creator? You’ll likely need a screen with better color range. Are you looking for a work machine? You’ll need more CPU grunt. Are you looking for a media consumption device? A cheaper tablet can do that. Do you want something ultra portable? Consider a phablet. It’s aimed at artists and a handwriting niche market but it doesn’t kick goals the way a dedicated graphics tablet would. It is not a bad device though by any means. In trying to be a multi-use jack of all trades, in the end it is a master of none. Still, with a bit more grunt, the right OS (Google Andromeda?) and some tweaks to the keyboard and tablet functions (like using the stylus on the screen), we think a device like the Lenovo Yoga Book can be a real winner. While our time with the Yoga Book was very enjoyable, in the end it felt more like a companion device that was cool to use rather than one we’d consider as our ‘one device for all’ replacement. The concept is amazing, particularly the digitizing of handwritten content feature, which uses normal paper. It’s super light and portable with superb build quality, but we feel the Yoga Book is lacking a suitable OS and killer mass market appeal right now.  Right now it just feels a generation too early for what it is. We very much look forward to what Lenovo and other companies can do with the increasingly prevalent ultra portable 2 in 1 concept going forward. The Lenovo Yoga Book is currently priced at $899 SGD for both the Windows 10 and Android versions.         Pros: Premium design Battery life Ultra light and thin Digital recreations of handwritten content with normal paper Excellent build quality   Cons: Under powered Micro USB port Overall lack of ports Flawed keyboard   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Oukitel K6000 Plus Smartphone Review: Unlimited Battery Life Next Article The Meizu m2 Note is a Budget Phone that Appeals to Youths Related Articles AndroidGoogleNewsWearables Android Wear 2.0 won’t be here until early 2017 Babu Mohan September 30, 2016 GamingMicrosoftNewsPC GamesPS3PS4ReviewsSonyXbox 360Xbox One Top 5 First Person Shooter Games of 2016 Zayne Seah November 13, 2016November 15, 2016 Graphics CardsReviews Monster Stack: Inno3D NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GX2 TeamVR March 18, 2008 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Owens Published: Apr 25, 2017 8:39 p.m. ET Share Autonomous-driving tech merger could take until end of the year to close, and Intel must protect its turf from AMD and Nvidia Getty Images Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, is expected to report quarterly revenue of $14.8 billion on Thursday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Intel Corp. is expected to release quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, but the biggest change to its results is still months away. Revenue for the world’s largest chip maker has mostly been stuck in neutral for years as sales of personal computers have languished and smartphone makers have largely looked elsewhere for the brains of their devices. After missing the mobile boom, Intel INTC, +0.33%  is making a big-money bet that autonomous-driving technology will be a similar moneymaker with a $15 billion bid for Mobileye NV. MBLY, +0.34%  Along with an investment in German digital-mapping company HERE, Intel is looking to challenge Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.74%  in autonomous-car offerings. How 4D mapping could change the way we live and work(2:19) Mapping-software company HERE is owned by the biggest German automotive companies - BMW, Audi and Mercedes owner Daimler. HERE CEO Edzard Overbeek spoke to MarketWatch about the evolution of maps from two to three and, eventually, four dimensions. Intel’s deal for the Israeli self-driving specialist will take a while to close, however: The companies said when the deal was announced in March that completion could take up to nine months, which would put it close to the end of the year. Intel could provide an update to that wide timeline in Thursday’s conference call. Don’t miss: How Intel will try to avoid another acquisition fail with Mobileye While Intel attempts to build for the future, though, competitors are looking to take a larger chunk of the areas Intel currently dominates. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +2.74%  introduced new PC and gaming chips in the quarter with prices much lower than Intel’s, and shrinking margins in the PC group would suggest that Intel has lowered its prices to compete. A larger battle is shaping up in the server market, where Nvidia has found growing acceptance and AMD is expected to release its newest offering this quarter. Here’s what to expect Revenue: Intel revenue actually increased more than 7% in 2016, the company’s most substantial sales growth since 2011. However, much of that increase was attributable to the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp., which added a segment for programmable semiconductors to Intel’s revenue that contributed more than $2.1 billion, as well as a healthier-than-expected holiday season for PC sales. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel projects revenue of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion, which would be an improvement from $13.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expect on average for Intel to report revenue of $14.8 billion, directly in the middle of its forecast range. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect revenue of $14.9 billion. See also: Semiconductor stocks can be long-term winners too Earnings: While revenue gained for Intel in 2016, net income took a hit as the company faced restructuring charges from a massive wave of layoffs a few months after the Altera deal closed. Nearly $1.9 billion in restructuring charges landed on the 2016 balance sheet, with another $400 million or so expected this year. Intel projected earnings of 51 cents a share to 61 cents a share for the first quarter, with adjusted profit of 60 cents to 70 cents a share. The average analyst estimate calls for standard earnings of 57 cents a share, and adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share, according to FactSet. Estimize contributors on average predict adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share. Stock reaction: Intel has suffered in the past three months, falling 2.5% through Tuesday as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  gained 3.9% in the same time. Results are different in the past year, though, as Intel has gained 17.5% in that time while the S&P has increased 14.4%. Intel’s performance following an earnings report has been split of late, with declines in three of the past seven quarters. The drops were much larger than the gains, however: Intel increased 1.1% to 2.4% when it benefited after a report in that time and fell 4% to 9.1% when it declined. What analysts are saying: Intel’s earnings could top expectations because of continued stabilization in PC sales, which represents Intel’s largest revenue source. Intel projected that PC sales would drop 5% in 2017, but first-quarter results tracked by International Data Corp. and Gartner Inc. showed a stronger performance. “We believe Intel could see upside in its PC business driven by better product mix and a slightly better-than-expected PC environment,” Susquehanna Financial Group analysts wrote. Susquehanna has a Positive rating on Intel shares with a $45 price target, tied for the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Related: AMD stock plummets after Goldman Sachs says rally is unsustainable AMD’s Ryzen launch could keep the PC business from outperforming expectations, however, and Susquehanna slightly decreased its projected gross margin for Intel based on expectations of lower average selling prices to compete with AMD. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also pointed out that year-over-year comparisons need to take into account a shorter quarter this year. “While some investors have gotten more excited about improving (or at least stabilizing) PCs, we note the presence of an extra week in the year-ago quarter,” wrote Rasgon, who has an Underweight rating for Intel and $30 price target, the lowest tracked by FactSet. This is the future of 3-D printing(2:19) Max Friefeld, CEO of Voodoo Manufacturing, the nation's first robot-operated 3-D printing hub, talks to MarketWatch about how 3-D printing can revolutionize mass manufacturing. The recent price spike for memory chips could also help Intel’s profit for the quarter. While the increase in memory prices has hurt the profits of same major tech players, companies that sell memory chips have enjoyed stronger margins, as Micron Technology Inc. MU, +1.58%  showed last month. Intel’s memory business is its fourth-largest segment, with $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue, and is expected to become its third-largest revenue driver in the second quarter, with analyst expectations of $744 million in sales. Overall, analysts believe Intel is a largely predictable tech behemoth at the moment, with little near-term upside until, and unless, the big Mobileye bet pays off. Read also: A big chunk of the Dow’s gains have come from earnings “We agree with management’s long-term decision to invest for growth; however, turning a battleship like Intel takes time and we believe other stocks will generate more attractive returns during this period of prolonged transition,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay recently wrote. Canaccord has a Hold rating and $38 price target on Intel stock. FactSet reports that 24 of the 41 analysts covering Intel have the equivalent of a Buy or Overweight rating on Intel stock, while just three give it a Sell or Underweight rating. The average price target is $39.84, reflecting 8.1% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $36.87. More from MarketWatch What if John Bogle is right about 4% stock returns?

Don’t miss: How Intel will try to avoid another acquisition fail with Mobileye While Intel attempts to build for the future, though, competitors are looking to take a larger chunk of the areas Intel currently dominates. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +2.74%  introduced new PC and gaming chips in the quarter with prices much lower than Intel’s, and shrinking margins in the PC group would suggest that Intel has lowered its prices to compete. A larger battle is shaping up in the server market, where Nvidia has found growing acceptance and AMD is expected to release its newest offering this quarter. Here’s what to expect Revenue: Intel revenue actually increased more than 7% in 2016, the company’s most substantial sales growth since 2011. However, much of that increase was attributable to the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp., which added a segment for programmable semiconductors to Intel’s revenue that contributed more than $2.1 billion, as well as a healthier-than-expected holiday season for PC sales. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel projects revenue of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion, which would be an improvement from $13.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expect on average for Intel to report revenue of $14.8 billion, directly in the middle of its forecast range. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect revenue of $14.9 billion. See also: Semiconductor stocks can be long-term winners too Earnings: While revenue gained for Intel in 2016, net income took a hit as the company faced restructuring charges from a massive wave of layoffs a few months after the Altera deal closed. Nearly $1.9 billion in restructuring charges landed on the 2016 balance sheet, with another $400 million or so expected this year. Intel projected earnings of 51 cents a share to 61 cents a share for the first quarter, with adjusted profit of 60 cents to 70 cents a share. The average analyst estimate calls for standard earnings of 57 cents a share, and adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share, according to FactSet. Estimize contributors on average predict adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share. Stock reaction: Intel has suffered in the past three months, falling 2.5% through Tuesday as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.61%  gained 3.9% in the same time. Results are different in the past year, though, as Intel has gained 17.5% in that time while the S&P has increased 14.4%. Intel’s performance following an earnings report has been split of late, with declines in three of the past seven quarters. The drops were much larger than the gains, however: Intel increased 1.1% to 2.4% when it benefited after a report in that time and fell 4% to 9.1% when it declined. What analysts are saying: Intel’s earnings could top expectations because of continued stabilization in PC sales, which represents Intel’s largest revenue source. Intel projected that PC sales would drop 5% in 2017, but first-quarter results tracked by International Data Corp. and Gartner Inc. showed a stronger performance. “We believe Intel could see upside in its PC business driven by better product mix and a slightly better-than-expected PC environment,” Susquehanna Financial Group analysts wrote. Susquehanna has a Positive rating on Intel shares with a $45 price target, tied for the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Related: AMD stock plummets after Goldman Sachs says rally is unsustainable AMD’s Ryzen launch could keep the PC business from outperforming expectations, however, and Susquehanna slightly decreased its projected gross margin for Intel based on expectations of lower average selling prices to compete with AMD. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also pointed out that year-over-year comparisons need to take into account a shorter quarter this year. “While some investors have gotten more excited about improving (or at least stabilizing) PCs, we note the presence of an extra week in the year-ago quarter,” wrote Rasgon, who has an Underweight rating for Intel and $30 price target, the lowest tracked by FactSet.

The recent price spike for memory chips could also help Intel’s profit for the quarter. While the increase in memory prices has hurt the profits of same major tech players, companies that sell memory chips have enjoyed stronger margins, as Micron Technology Inc. MU, +1.58%  showed last month. Intel’s memory business is its fourth-largest segment, with $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue, and is expected to become its third-largest revenue driver in the second quarter, with analyst expectations of $744 million in sales. Overall, analysts believe Intel is a largely predictable tech behemoth at the moment, with little near-term upside until, and unless, the big Mobileye bet pays off.

Canaccord has a Hold rating and $38 price target on Intel stock. FactSet reports that 24 of the 41 analysts covering Intel have the equivalent of a Buy or Overweight rating on Intel stock, while just three give it a Sell or Underweight rating. The average price target is $39.84, reflecting 8.1% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $36.87. More from MarketWatch Is the free food offer at Walt Disney World really worth it?

Owens Published: Apr 25, 2017 8:39 p.m. ET Share Autonomous-driving tech merger could take until end of the year to close, and Intel must protect its turf from AMD and Nvidia Getty Images Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, is expected to report quarterly revenue of $14.8 billion on Thursday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Intel Corp. is expected to release quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, but the biggest change to its results is still months away. Revenue for the world’s largest chip maker has mostly been stuck in neutral for years as sales of personal computers have languished and smartphone makers have largely looked elsewhere for the brains of their devices. After missing the mobile boom, Intel INTC, +0.33%  is making a big-money bet that autonomous-driving technology will be a similar moneymaker with a $15 billion bid for Mobileye NV. MBLY, +0.34%  Along with an investment in German digital-mapping company HERE, Intel is looking to challenge Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.74%  in autonomous-car offerings. How 4D mapping could change the way we live and work(2:19) Mapping-software company HERE is owned by the biggest German automotive companies - BMW, Audi and Mercedes owner Daimler. HERE CEO Edzard Overbeek spoke to MarketWatch about the evolution of maps from two to three and, eventually, four dimensions.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" The designer laptop Hands-on with the luxury Porsche Design Book One Windows 10 PC By Richard Devine Tuesday, Apr 25, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 30 Comments The Porsche Design Book One is unique and amazing, thanks in part to the power of Windows 10. Announced at Mobile World Congress in February 2017, Porsche Design came storming out of left field with its Book One. And it's far from just another expensive laptop. The Book One is the world's only fully convertible and detachable 2-in-1 notebook. The fact that this can be achieved, and to such a high standard, is a testament to what Porsche Design does best: designing. Porsche Design isn't new to tech The Book One is the latest in a long line of Porsche Design products, and it isn't the first tech product the company put its name on, either. It has had partnerships in smartphones with BlackBerry and more recently, Huawei, and now with a dedicated computing division. Microsoft and Intel both had a hand in bringing the Book One to life. The project was two years in the making and was a result of a collaboration with three other companies: Intel, Microsoft and Quanta, the manufacturing partner putting each Book One together. From the outset, the desire was to create a product to meet the needs of Porsche Design's traditional customers, or in other words, business folks. The brand has always commanded premium prices for premium products. And those products are unmistakable, just like the Book One. The key to the convertible aspect is the clever hinge. True to the Porsche heritage, the hinge on the Book One was designed with similar principles to a gearbox. It looks like two cogs turning together, and while it's beautiful to look at, the function is what's most important. It allows the display on the Book One to fold completely around and sit perfectly flat against the keyboard base. Each portion is perfectly uniform at 7.9 mm thick, and using it like a 13.3-inch tablet is comfortable. The weight isn't excessive and considering the anodized aluminum construction, that's a pleasant surprise. Like the Microsoft Surface Book, the display portion of the Book One lifts completely away so you get a 13.3-inch tablet. Naturally, that means all the internal hardware is in the top portion of the device, with the keyboard housing nothing but keys, a battery and some ports. The two batteries on the Book One combine for 70 Wh, or up to 14 hours in real world terms. Book One is high-end inside and out Inside the top portion, you have first the 13.3-inch QHD+ 3200 x 1800 resolution display. Beneath that lies 16GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 "Kaby Lake" processor and a 512GB PCIe solid state drive (SSD). Besides a headphone jack, the solitary connector on this part of the Book One is a USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. This isn't for the mass market, but that's no reason for it not to exist. The keyboard base also has a USB-C connection, but it's not Thunderbolt 3, so if you're hooking up to external displays and docking stations, you'll need to use the port at the side of the display. The keys feel a little like the Surface Book's buttons and are every bit as high quality feeling as every other aspect of this laptop. Speaking of external displays, Porsche Design includes a USB C-to-HDMI adapter in the box with every Book One. There will also be an optional docking station, which is essentially a similar piece of equipment to the latest Surface Docking Station.  This laptop isn't for everyone, and it will never have mass market appeal. But that's not a reason for it not to exist. Devices like this are a showcase of what you can only achieve in a laptop thanks to Windows 10. A MacBook is expensive, but you can't draw on the screen with the (included) Wacom pen, or fold the display around, or pull it away altogether. The target Book One buyer is going to be the same sort of person who spent a ton on a Porsche Design BlackBerry. That's professionals, fans of the brand, or folks who invest in the premium end of the market. Not everyone wants or can afford a Razer Blade Pro, either. Every detail has been thought out with perfection in mind. The Porsche Design Book One is expected to be released soon and will be available in 17 countries — mostly in Europe, but also the U.S. and Canada — for €2,795 (roughly U.S.$3,030). It will be available from Porsche Design directly as well as via select retail partners. In the U.S., for example, you'll be able to get one at Newegg and the Microsoft Store. The Book One leaves a strong first impression. On the outside, it's exquisitely designed and constructed, while inside it's everything you'd expect from a 2017 high-end Ultrabook. Every detail has been carefully thought out and executed with perfection in mind. And I (really) want one.

Just curious. Is it for designing? 3 14 hours ago Reply bobsentell Some people like watching all of their movies in letterbox format... probably. 1 14 hours ago Reply Krystianpants Ahh I guess that would make sense. I don't really watch movies on small screens and if I do I'm already making a compromise by watching on the smaller screen, black bars won't bother me. 0 14 hours ago Reply gurdas The 3:2 ratio comes close to the ratios of actual paper sizes such as letter and A4. The 16:9 ratio that has been popular in past years was driven by the movie industry standards, but with advent of tablets and touch, the screen was used for doing things we do with paper, such as reading and drawing. 1 13 hours ago Reply ladydias This is pretty much it.  For drawing, reading (especially with PDFs) and writng on a tablet the 3:2 ratio is far superior to 16:9.  The latter is better for video consumption and creation via keyboard and mouse, though but not by much. 1 12 hours ago Reply Krystianpants That sort of makes more sense. Especially if you want to have it as close to letterhead as possible. You jot stuff down and know if you print it will only use 1 page. Unless of course windows ink compensates for it the ratio and does all the work for you. Then it becomes preference for what you prefer holding. 1 12 hours ago Reply Dillan K 3:2 is the ratio of dimensions of a full frame camera sensor, the same as a frame of 35mm film. No cropping needed when selecting wallpaper from your family photos! 1 13 hours ago Reply Richard Devine I mean...if that's the best reason for it ;-) 0 13 hours ago Reply CaedenV Well... if your family photos are on 35mm film. All my family pics are digital, and mostly 16:9 Personally, I have always enjoyed 16:10 as the best compromise aspect ratio. A little taller for productivity work, and when watching 16:9 content it is just enough height where the playback UI doesn't get in the video frame 1 8 hours ago Reply anthonyng vertical height so valuable.  So much to me that one of my two external displays is set to portrait orientation. 0 12 hours ago Reply j m robin I never thought that aspect ratio would be that important to me, but after using the 3:2 ratio on Surface, I honestly cannot go back to anything else (well, at least not comfortably) looks sleek, though 1 14 hours ago Reply COLIN BARNHORST I think the choices in the premium market are getting really great. A testimony to the tech manufacturing world's evaluation of Windows 10. All this will help Mac fans as well because Apple has to respond with comparable features and quality, as would any manufacturer. This is a really interesting time in personal tech. 1 14 hours ago Reply Jeff Bennion Was there going to be a video to go along with this hands on? I was looking for one here but I don't see it! 0 14 hours ago Reply Richard Devine Nope. It's due for release soon and we'll hopefully be getting one for the full Mark and Dan treatment. 0 13 hours ago Reply vezycash Article doesn't deserve the title "hands on." 0 14 hours ago Reply Daniel Rubino (insert eye roll) Comes for the content, stays for the armchair editorializing about titles. 1 13 hours ago Reply Richard Devine Assume that's because this post doesn't have a video and there's actual reading to be done. 1 13 hours ago Reply lbp775 A very nice device.  The only thing that would make it better is if they offered it in Guards Red.  0 13 hours ago Reply BonzeUK In Ferrari colours? Don't think so ;-) -1 13 hours ago Reply lbp775 Where did you get that???

Good thing there is a SB competitor. Gives buyers more options in the premium market. Both of these devices are cooler than a macbook. 0 11 hours ago Reply Richard Devine Microsoft was involved in this project throughout, helping there be an alternative to the SB :) 0 11 hours ago Reply Big_Dragon It looks nice. I like the clean lines. It seems to fix some of the design issues with the Surface Book hinge and gap. It's nice to see another capable 2-in-1 device with a good stylus. The system is under-powered though. HD Graphics 620 pales in comparison to Iris graphics or dedicated Nvidia graphics. There are also a lot of other 2-in-1s with the i7-7500u CPU. It seems like an HP Spectre x360 would be a better buy. Same power, good design, and a much lower price. If this had discrete graphics or a quad-core CPU I'd take it more seriously. 0 10 hours ago Reply Kot Prada Cool! I'm glad Porsche got on Windows. Probably, they will also make some Windows Phone instead of that Android sh*t. Switching from BlackBerry to Android killed Porsche-Desgin for me. 0 9 hours ago Reply lbp775 Switching to Android probably killed it for you but I think everyone could understand why. 0 9 hours ago Reply windows4winners Reading this I must admit to being pleasantly surprised when I got down to the price given this is the same company that sell ludicrously expensive kitchen knives and writing utensils, one could argue that a chef or professional may see that differently.   Anyway for this spec a comparable MacBook Pro [which I'd guess most people will compare this too] will cost more, so really not that costly. My only complaint would be with the white keyboard as I find these harder to read in sunlight.   0 6 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
Digital Trends Home > Computing > MSI adds Intel Optane motherboard bundles for… MSI adds Intel Optane motherboard bundles for better performance By Mark Coppock — April 25, 2017 11:47 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you want to build a PC using Intel Optane memory modules, then you will want to consider MSI's new Opt Boost motherboard bundles. One of the more interesting recent developments in PC components is Intel’s Optane storage system, which is built using advanced 3D XPoint memory technology that Intel co-developed with memory maker Micron. Not only does Optane make for some outrageously fast solid-state drives (SSDs) but it also helps speed up slower spinning hard- disk drives (HDDs). The version of Optane that helps HDDs perform more like speedier SSDs has arrived by way of 16GB and 32GB add-on products that plug into supported motherboards. It is an effective way to add speed while saving some money, and motherboard maker MSI is offering new motherboard bundles that throw in the 16GB Optane module for free. According to our own tests, Optane can provide some noticeable performance improvements for reasonable prices. The 16GB version has a retail price of $44 and the 32GB version costs $77. While buyers can purchase Optane and plug it into a supported motherboard themselves, MSI is making the process easier — and less expensive — by simply including Optane out of the box. Obviously, the motherboard bundles include MSI’s most recent options that provide the required Intel Z270 and B250 chipset support along with the M.2 connections that the Optane modules utilize. MSI is offering up three motherboard options, including the Z270 Tomahawk Opt Boost, the B250M Bazooka Opt Boost, and the Pro Series B250M Pro Opt Boost. Each of these motherboards offers the kind of performance high-end users are looking for, including USB 3.1 Gen2 support, Turbo M.2 to squeeze out full performance from the PCI-E Gen3 x4 architecture, and support for the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors known as Kaby Lake. Note that Intel Optane also requires Kaby Lake CPUs. In addition, all of MSI’s 200 Series motherboards can support Optane via the latest BIOS updates. Go grab the latest BIOS update for supported MSI motherboards before you plug in that Intel Optane module. MSI has not yet provided pricing or availability information for any of the Optane-equipped Opt Boost motherboards. However, rest assured that whichever model you choose, you will be getting the extra benefit of faster HDD performance without additional expense or hassle.

Twitter Facebook This is the closest thing Intel has built to a discrete GPU Intel Visual Compute Accelerator 2, targeted at servers, includes an Iris Pro P580 graphics processor and three Xeon processors Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 26 April, 2017 06:01 - - - - print email Comments Intel doesn't make its own discrete GPU but has built something that specializes in processing 4K graphics. But that product isn't powerful enough to run Crysis, if you were wondering. The chipmaker showed off its Intel Visual Compute Accelerator 2 at the NAB show in Las Vegas this week. It has the build of a GPU but is designed for server applications and not for PCs. The VCA 2 is aimed at cloud streaming 4K video, graphics, and virtual reality content. Servers with the graphics accelerator installed could be used to stream video or broadcast content. The VCA 2 uses the 4K-capable Iris Pro Graphics P580 graphics chip and three Intel Xeon E3-1500 v5 processors. The P580 is also used in Intel's mini-PC called Skull Canyon, which is designed for gaming. Like GPUs, the VCA 2 plugs into PCI-Express 3.0 slots. It is not meant to be the main CPU or GPU for a PC. It uses year-old GPU technology, not the faster Iris Pro GPUs that are in the 7th Generation Core chips. You won't be able to buy VCA 2 off the shelf, but instead, it'll be sold directly to server and device makers. Intel declined to comment on when it'll be available. The VCA 2 is an upgrade from its predecessor, simply called the Visual Compute Accelerator. The original VCA had the older Iris Pro graphics P6300, used in Broadwell chips, and the older Xeon E3-v4 chips. At NAB, Haivision showed its KB 4K Encoder, which is powered by Intel's VCA 2. The device helped stitch and stream 360-degree content taken by Nokia's OZO Live 4K virtual reality camera. The content is delivered to VR headsets. Intel isn't really known for its prowess in GPUs, though its new integrated processors in some Kaby Lake chips support 4K. PCs with Intel's integrated GPUs can handle VR content but have a long way to go to compete with AMD or Nvidia GPUs. Larrabee, from 2010, was Intel's first attempt to make a discrete high-end GPU, but the product was unceremoniously abandoned even after a prototype was shown. Technical challenges led to its cancellation, but its byproducts were used in the Xeon Phi supercomputing and integrated graphics chips. A full-fledged GPU still doesn't exist in Intel's arsenal, and that's a big hole because of the growing popularity of gaming, virtual reality, and machine learning. Nvidia and AMD GPUs are used in most servers involved in deep learning, natural language processing, and other machine-learning tasks. Intel has said FPGAs could mimic GPUs to an extent. But GPUs are much more flexible than FPGAs, which are designed to do specific tasks. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Qualcomm's modems support Gigabit LTE, but Intel's won't until next year, CNET says. Gigabit LTE is starting its rollout in some cities this year. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Toru Hanai | Reuters Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook The next iPhone may not be able to hold a candle to the Galaxy S8 when it comes to how fast you'll be able to download music and movies or surf the web. CNET published an enlightening report on Tuesday that explains why this might be the case, especially if history repeats itself. Earlier this month, for example, Qualcomm countersued Apple alleging in part that Apple doesn't use Qualcomm's modems to their full potential. Apple buys modems from both Intel and Qualcomm and needs both to perform similarly for the end user, even if one chip can technically outperform another. That's why the company may hold back some modems from their full potential, at least according to Qualcomm. Here's why that will matter moving forward. Qualcomm's latest chip, the Snapdragon 835, features the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which is capable of providing Gigabit LTE download and upload speeds. Without getting too technical, Gigabit LTE has the potential to be much, much faster than 4G LTE — the current wireless standard in the U.S. A very fast wireless speed right now would come in around 100Mbps, so we're talking about 10x that. show chapters Apple's iPhone 8 will be delayed, according to a KGI analyst    Monday, 24 Apr 2017 | 10:45 AM ET | 00:56 U.S. carriers will begin rolling out support for Gigabit LTE this year as they move to rolling out 5G networks, and phones like the Galaxy S8 are "future-proof" with support for the new tech. Intel won't offer Gigabit LTE in its chips until next year, CNET said, which is where the problem lies. (Intel declined to comment.) Apple uses its own processors in the iPhone but will almost certainly purchase modems from both Qualcomm and Intel, as it typically does. If this is the case, Apple may have some modems from Qualcomm that are capable of supporting Gigabit LTE — and others from Intel that are not. Several scenarios could play out if that happens. Apple could launch a new iPhone with modems from Intel and Qualcomm that don't support Gigabit LTE at all. Or it could launch smartphones with modems from Intel that don't support Gigabit LTE and modems from Qualcomm that do, but sandbag the Qualcomm modems to keep everything even. It might also decide to keep the Qualcomm chips for launch in the U.S., as CNET suggests, and deploy Intel chips in international markets where Gigabit LTE isn't ready to launch yet. Finally, and here's just a shot-in-the-dark scenario, Apple could reserve the Gigabit LTE modems from Qualcomm for the rumored iPhone 8 and leave 4G LTE modems in the rumored iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Customers who want to pay for the added speeds could simply buy the more premium smartphone. Gigabit LTE is expected to start hitting only some cities this year, so it might not seem necessary for consumers to buy smartphones with Gigabit LTE support just yet. If you're planning to keep it for a few years, however, Gigabit LTE is definitely something you'll want to make sure your new smartphone supports.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware  ⋮  Report Intel X299 HEDT Platform For Skylake X and Kaby Lake X Processors Announcement on 30th May, Launch on 26th June – Reviews Go Live on 16th June By Hassan Mujtaba 12 hours ago 106Shares Share Tweet Submit We have just received information on Intel X299 HEDT platform launch schedule. The Intel X299 platform will feature support for the next generation Kaby Lake X and Skylake X processors. Intel X299 HEDT Platform Launch Schedule Confirmed – New Enthusiast Family For Skylake X and Kaby Lake X Processors From the details we have gathered, it seems like Intel is preparing for a big launch of their next high-end desktop platform for consumers. Known as X299, the new platform will feature support for the upcoming processor families codenamed Skylake X and Kaby Lake X. These processors will be available in various SKUs and will be hitting retail on 26th June. Related Colorful Unveils Enthusiast Grade iGame GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Vulcan X OC Graphics Card – Triple Fan, Triple Slot Cooler For 16+2 Phase PCB Intel’s Skylake-X platform promises to introduce the first ever 12-core SKU for the Mainstream/HEDT segment. Intel plans to announce their HEDT X299 platform on 30th May at Computex. The launch will include full showcase of details and prices of the new processors while Intel board partners will be readying several X299 chipset based motherboards for the enthusiast crowd. These motherboards will also be shown at the Computex 2017 floor. After announcement, the NDA for reviews and press information will be over. The exact date for NDA is 16th June so buyers will get to see product performance and in-depth tests prior to the market release. This will allow buyers to decide which motherboard and processor is most suitable for their needs. The general market availability is planned for 26th of June. The launch would be global and several products, including processors and motherboards will be available to purchase from retail outlets. Intel Skylake X Processor Family For Intel X299 Platform Details: The Skylake X family in particular will feature five SKUs that include a 12 core, 10 core, 8 core and a 6 core model. The 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on the Skylake architecture. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W and we can expect clock speeds north of the 3.0 GHz range and boosts of 4.0 GHz+ on the 6 core and 8 core chips. The 12 core chip will be the new flagship and will come with higher PCIe lanes with faster memory support. Related Intel Coffee Lake S 6 Core Desktop Processor Leaked, Core i5 Without Hyper Threading – Coffee Lake 4 Core, 8 Thread Embedded CPU Detailed Too Intel’s new X299 chipset will be the latest PCH to support the enthusiast processors. The X299 platform will be centered around the LGA 2066 socket which will be compatible with at least two generations of processors. In specs, the X299 chipset offers up to 24 PCIe Gen 3.0 lanes. The chip also offers up to quad channel memory with speeds up to DDR4-2667 MHz (native). Kaby Lake-X series processors will only support dual channel RAM but will stick to the native speeds of 2667 MHz. The Basin Falls PCH also offers 10 USB 3.0, 8 USB 2.0 ports, SATA 3.0, and Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) controllers. Additional features include Enhanced SPI, SPI, LPC, SMBus and HD audio which are integrated underneath its hood. Intel Kaby Lake X Processor Family For Intel X299 Platform Details The Intel Kaby Lake X processor lineup is a new entrant to the HEDT landscape. The two processors that are featured in this lineup are quad cores. The Core i7 7740K and Core i5 7640K will be available under a price tag of $400 US. Advertisement The general aim of these processors is to provide users an incentive to upgrade to the HEDT platform without burning a lot of cash. Users can go the mainstream route with the current Kaby Lake S family but for those who want to upgrade to a higher end processor can go for a Kaby Lake X CPU and later purchase a 6, 8, 10 or 12 core processor. Intel Core i7 7740K Processor Specifications – The Fastest Quad Core Chip The Intel Core i7 7740K processor will become the fastest Core i7 chip in the Kaby Lake lineup. It will replace the Core i7 7700K with slightly better specs. This chip features a quad core, hyper-threaded design. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. The clock speeds are rated 4.2 GHz base and 4.5 GHz boost. The processor packs 8 MB of L3 cache and has a TDP of 112W. There’s no word on the retail price but it should be a bit higher, or if Intel does feel like offering real competition to the Ryzen chips, they could price it the same as the Core i7 7700K while dropping the former in price. Intel Core i5 7640K Processor Specifications – First Core i5 For HEDT Platforms The Intel Core i5 7640K processor will be the first instance of a Core i5 chip on the HEDT platform. This chip features a quad core design along with four threads. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. The clock speeds are rated 4.0 GHz base but boost would be beyond 4 GHz. The processor packs 6 MB of L3 cache. The TDP is rated at 112W, just like the Core i7 processor in the Kaby Lake-X family. Intel’s 14nm+ is the most advanced process architecture available in the industry. Other updates will include support for quad channel memory which will be a good bump over dual channel. The new X299 platform would offer more PCIe lanes from the CPU and PCH. Both quad cores would be pitted against 6 core Ryzen chips as current Intel quad cores provide good productivity and gaming performance against the competition.

Just recently, it was leaked that the Skylake X processors lineup would feature a massive 12 core, 24 thread juggernaut processor. The Core i7 6950X is still the flagship chip when it comes to HEDT processors so we can’t wait to see what the new 12 core part has stuffed under its hood. The Skylake X and Kaby Lake X are meant to make a formal debut on 30th May followed by market availability by the end of June. This marks the announcement at Computex which is in line with what we have recently been hearing so expect to see lots of motherboards being shown off at the event floor.

SSDs are faster, with no moving parts, and generate less heat while also typically being considerably smaller than their platter-based counterparts. SSDs are already a step up in almost every way, but Intel decided it just wasn’t happy with the way solid state technology was headed, and somehow managed to one-up the rest of the industry with an SSD that is faster than pretty much anything else on the market, and now they’re shipping. Don't Miss: Apple’s actual iPhone 8 design may have just leaked for the first time The Intel Optane P4800X is the first product from the company to utilize the new 3D XPoint memory technology. It utilizes a PCIe slot, and has a capacity of 375GB, but other sizes ranging from 750GB to 1.5TB have already been confirmed by Intel as being in the pipeline for 2017 releases. It’s significantly faster than NAND-based flash storage with a small fraction of the latency, and while it’s slower than DRAM, it’s also ten times more dense. The new drive technology is also a whole lot more durable and, unlike flash data storage, 3D XPoint won’t physically degrade the storage media, allowing it to be written upon many more times than NAND-based drives without as much concern for overall drive health. So, Intel’s Optane drives are awesome and way faster, longer-lasting, and better than SSDs… but you knew there had to be a catch. All this cutting edge technology doesn’t come cheap, and if you were considering picking up a P4800X for your own rig you should know that it’s primarily designed for data center use and, due to its price, it’s pretty much only an option for enterprise applications, at least for now. The debut drive will set you back a cool $1,520, and for just 375GB of storage, that’s not exactly budge-friendly. Still, the technology is extremely promising and will surely find its way to home computers before too long.

Reports Q1 Earnings Investors should look out for fresh detail on the PC and data-center markets, and then sit down to analyze the chip giant's revisions to full-year guidance targets. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Apr 25, 2017 at 1:00PM Semiconductor titan Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, April 27. The report will cover Intel's first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Here's what to expect. By the numbers Metric Q1 2017 Guidance Q1 2016 Result Expected Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $14.8 billion $13.7 billion 8% Operating margin 24% 19% 26% Earnings per share (diluted) $0.56 $0.42 33% Data source: Intel. Meeting the official guidance targets would continue a four-quarter string of annualized revenue growth while breaking a somewhat longer negative trend in year-over-year operating-margin changes. The goals look even more confident when you consider that the year-ago quarter was one week longer, so Intel is working against a 7% headwind of accounting policies here. These guidance targets assume a stable macroeconomic environment, but management took a deliberately cautious view of the prospect for recovery in the PC market. In particular, Intel didn't want to overplay its hand regarding PC growth in emerging markets such as China, Russia, and Latin America. Image source: Intel. 3 key issues to watch Going beyond the plain numbers, Intel investors should keep an eye out for more detail on the PC and data-center markets, along with a fresh round of guidance updates. 1. PC market: Intel's management wanted to set a low bar for PC expectations this time. Analysts see signs of a stability there, backed by a strong report from systems builder Dell (NYSE:DVMT) and a rosy report on European PC sales from the market trackers at IDC. If correct, these positive trends could move the needle for Intel's PC chip sales. The company is moving resources away from that division to strengthen efforts in automotive computing, the Internet of Things, and other higher-growth sectors. But it looks as if there's still some life left in this aging market segment. 2. Data center: Right now, the data-center story is built around cloud computing. Intel saw hardware orders from cloud service providers increase 24% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2016, while plain old enterprise-class server chip sales decreased by 3%. These market tendencies seem stable for the relatively long haul, but do watch out for more clues in Thursday's report. 3. Guidance: There are two important angles to the guidance game. First, Intel will provide a clear view of how the third quarter is shaping up. This will attract a lot of media attention and will indeed help investors build a world view for the currently ongoing quarter. But the company will also update its full-year guidance targets, based on the first quarter's reported results and market trends going forward. This is often a far more useful set of goals. Any changes to important line items such as revenue, gross margin, or operating income can paint up Intel's true levels of success (or lack thereof) in bright, bold colors. If you only have time to dig into one of Intel's guidance tables this week, make it this one.  Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The list of companies that snapped their respective top Bollinger Band grew even larger overnight as the geopolitical concerns around the world appear to be melting away, at least for now. Today’s three big stock charts look at another batch of companies that are seeing bullish volatility breakouts as technical support and breaks above their Bollinger Bands signal short-term rallies that may turn to trends. Among the names are Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) and Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN). Intel Corporation (INTC) Is Intel playing catch-up or is it getting ready for a breakout, or both? The semiconductor leader, in size only, has been lagging the market for some time as the smaller, more nimble companies have been moving ahead in terms of performance. Year-to-date performance shows INTC’s weakness, posting 1.5% gains compared to the rest of the market gaining 8%. From a technical perspective, Intel’s trendline analysis looks somewhat healthy as many of the companies within the sector. Trading above the 50- and 200-day trendlines that are also moving higher themselves, INTC is what we refer to as a technical bull. So, what about the underperformance? Volatility is the simple word. Intel is trading like a lumbering large cap now (which it is) as the shares have little to no volatility in their daily motion. All the while, the smaller companies in the sector are leaving INTC in the dust. So where from here? Intel is getting ready to benefit from a confluence of technical support at $36.  Currently, the 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages are all converging at $36. In the meantime, yesterday’s price move took the stock above its top Bollinger Band. Expect the bullish support and volatility signal to help shares rally back to $38. Sysco Corporation (SYY) The “other” Sysco hasn’t been performing much better than the networking company as the stock has lost 4% year-to-date. That said, a turnaround appears to be in the making. SYY stock recently grabbed trendline support from its 200-day moving average. This line has been trying to give shares a boost for the last month. Recently, the 50-day entered the picture to lend a hand, which appears to be helping at this time. The stock moved above this key trendline two days ago and has now broken above its top Bollinger Band too. Fast forward to today, Sysco shares are looking at overhead resistance from the 100-day at $53.35 and from our look of the charts, that’s the only thing that stands in the way of a run to $56 as the stock will pickup momentum from there. Watch for the overbought indicator to potentially slow things down, but for now SYY shares are considered a technical bull.

By Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Glenn Kessler The Washington Post   April 25, 2017 In a wide-ranging interview with Julie Pace of the Associated Press on April 21, President Donald Trump yet again made many false or misleading statements. Here’s a roundup. As is our practice, we don’t award Pinocchios in roundups. --- Advertisement ‘‘I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It’s actually a little bit more than that, but it’s $725 million.’’ Trump keeps claiming he saved hundreds of millions of dollars on the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes by intervening in negotiations with Lockheed Martin. But Lockheed already had planned cost reductions, and Trump overstates his role. Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here In a Dec. 19 briefing - before Trump began meeting with Lockheed’s chief executive Marillyn Hewson - the head of the Defense Department’s F-35 Joint Program Office announced costs would come down ‘‘significantly.’’ The average unit price for the planes has been declining for years, and the Pentagon had wanted to reduce costs further. The cost savings for the latest batch of planes was projected to be between $549 million and $630 million for a full lot of 90 planes. The Pentagon announced that the total savings from the program will be $728 million. This marks the 14th time Trump has made this false claim, which earned him Four Pinocchios. --- Advertisement ‘‘President Xi [of China], from the time I took office, they have not been currency manipulators.’’ Trump falsely claims China stopped devaluing its currency since he took office. China had not devalued its currency for about two years prior to his election. China artificially kept the value of the yuan, or renminbi, low for many years. But now, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy. From August 2015 through August 2016, China sold more than $570 billion in foreign currency to prevent more rapid depreciation of its currency, according to estimates by the Treasury Department. Yet throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly blamed China for being a ‘‘world champion’’ of devaluing the yuan. We rated that outdated claim Four Pinocchios. As president, Trump flip-flopped on this matter and decided he would no longer label China a currency manipulator. We rated this key economic campaign promise ‘‘Broken’’ in our Trump Promise Tracker. --- ‘‘You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. … As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, ‘Only because of you am I making this massive investment.’ Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that.’’ Trump likes to claim undue credit for corporate decisions that were made before he was elected president. And Trump exaggerates the number of jobs created since he became president; the number of net new jobs since January 2017 is 317,000. Ford’s decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico had more to do with the company’s long-term goals than with the administration. Ford outlined these goals in a contract it negotiated with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors announced jobs plans in January and March 2017, but the company did not credit Trump or his election. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a ‘‘new’’ plant in Arizona. The company announced its investment in this factory in 2011 with President Barack Obama, but it never opened. Intel is resuming its factory project because it anticipates a demand in computer chips that will be created there. As for the Chinese e-company Alibaba, its founder Jack Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015. --- ‘‘It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we’ve ever had.’’ This is doubtful. The biggest tax cut since World War II appears to have been Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, which was valued at 2.89 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the Treasury Department. Assuming a $20 trillion GDP in 2018, Trump’s tax cut would need to be valued at least $580 billion a year in order to exceed the size of the Reagan tax cut. --- ‘‘When WikiLeaks came out … never heard of WikiLeaks, never heard of it. When WikiLeaks came out, all I was just saying is, ‘Well, look at all this information here. This is pretty good stuff.’’’ Trump falsely claims he had not heard of WikiLeaks prior to the 2016 campaign. As CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski found, Trump denounced WikiLeaks as early as 2010. --- ‘‘Oh, I’m seeing numbers - $24 billion [for a border wall], I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. That’s not a lot of money relative to what we’re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in - and we’ll stop all of it.’’ During the presidential campaign, Trump used to claim that he could build 1,000 mile-long wall, made of precast concrete slabs 40 feet high, for $8 billion. The Fact Checker checked with construction experts and instead received estimates as high as $25 billion. A report issued by Senate Democrats in April came up with an even higher estimate: nearly $70 billion, before paying for land acquisition. The report said that maintenance costs would run about $150 million a year. Trump’s claim that the wall would halt the flow of drugs is dubious. Experts say that drugs are actually shipped through the border on the underside of vehicles that have permits to cross the border in a special lane. ‘‘As long as the U.S. remains the world’s largest consumer of coke, and as long as Mexico continues to provide it, no wall will ever be able to stop the trade,’’ wrote Roberto Saviano in Newsweek. --- ‘‘Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days.’’ In a speech on Oct. 22, Trump issued an unusually detailed 100-day-plan of action, which he called the ‘‘Contract with the American Voter.’’ The Fact Checker has used the plan as a template for tracking in campaign promises. Trump told the AP that ‘‘somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan’’ - but that was Trump himself. --- On NATO: ‘‘It’s not fair that we’re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they’re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I’m very strong on it and I’m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.’’ The United States spends about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending , far more that NATO’s guideline of 2 percent. The median spending level in 2016 for the 28 NATO countries is 1.53 percent of GDP, according to NATO, though NATO members are not expected to reach the 2 percent level until 2024. Meanwhile, the United States has defense responsibilities around the world, especially in Asia, which accounts for why U.S. spending is higher. In fact, U.S. bases in Europe are often used to redeploy forces in other theaters, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. --- ‘‘You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.’’ When NATO was founded in 1949, terrorism had long existed in Europe, often by separatist groups (such as Irish Republicans) or anarchists. A bombing in 1867 in London by the Irish Republican Brotherhood killed 12 people and injured 120. --- ‘‘The electoral college is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it’s very, very hard.’’ Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called blue wall - the Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent presidential elections. But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to be concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes are dissipated. This is one reason why in two recent elections - 2000 and 2016 - the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the electoral college to the Republican. --- ‘‘On any, on air, [CBS ‘Face the Nation’ host John] Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It’s the highest for ‘Face the Nation’ or as I call it, ‘Deface the Nation.’ It’s the highest for ‘Deface the Nation’ since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It’s a tremendous advantage.’’ Trump is slightly off on the numbers. Then-presidential candidate Trump’s Jan. 3, 2016, interview with host John Dickerson on CBS’s ‘‘Face the Nation’’ had an audience of 4.6 million. Of the total audience, about 1 million of them were adults aged 25 to 54, the coveted demographic among advertisers. The overall audience was the largest since Sept. 16, 2001, and the rating among adults 25 to 54 years old was the best since Nov. 17, 2013, according to CBS News. --- ‘‘I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don’t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.’’ Trump’s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded the ‘‘net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,’’ though it noted ‘‘there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.’’ As for farmers in Wisconsin being ‘‘killed’’ by NAFTA, Canadian dairy products are actually not covered by NAFTA, as that industry is protected from U.S. exports and remains under ‘‘supply management’’ (price controls) which results in high retail prices in Canada. Canadian consumers basically subsidize farmers; by contrast, American dairy producers receive subsidies from the U.S. government. --- Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., ‘‘said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.’’ Cummings has disputed this account, as the AP noted to Trump. Cummings told CNN that he said Trump he could become a good president ‘‘if . . . IF . . . he took steps to truly represent ALL Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on.’’ --- ‘‘So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.’’ Immigration advocates and lawyers say a ‘‘dreamer’’ (beneficiary of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program) has been deported under Trump’s broadened enforcement guidelines. The government disputes that the dreamer was deported. In any case, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump is arresting an increasing number of people with no criminal records, indicating that not only criminals have been targeted by his administration. According to The Washington Post’s analysis, the biggest spike in arrests of undocumented immigrants from Jan. 20 to March 13 was of immigrants with no criminal records. Loading comments...

The company was last valued at $4.1 billion; its share pricing values the company at $1.79 at the top of the proposed range. That’s a significant discount. Yikes. But here’s a different perspective from a site called IPO Candy: Don’t evaluate the success of Cloudera’s IPO based on its last round of funding in 2014, because that round, led by Intel, wasn’t made for financial reasons. Rather, value Cloudera on its prior valuation, which Term Sheet readers might remember happened right before Intel swooped in and plunked down $740 million, doubling Cloudera’s valuation in a matter of weeks. Before Intel’s money, Cloudera had just closed a chunk of funding from T. Rowe Price, Google Ventures, and Michael Dell’s family office, valuing the company at $1.8 billion. By that measure, Cloudera’s IPO, if priced at the top of its proposed range, will be flat. It’s not a great three-year return on capital, but it’s not the money-losing house of horrors it’s made out to be, either. Unicorn watch: In case you were wondering which stage of the Are-we-In-a-Tech-Bubble-Media-Narrative, we are in, it’s the Apocalyptic Metaphor stage. I made a visual aid: Yesterday the Wall Street Journal outlined the “haves and have-nots” moment the venture capital market is currently facing, covering the recent series of startup layoffs and shutdowns. And there’s the inevitable investor quote comparing today’s class of struggling startups to zombies. (They’re like the walking dead!” Many startups spent 2014 and 2015 stockpiling huge reserves of cash to weather what they thought would be a “storm of uncertainty” caused by public market volatility. (I wrote at the time: “Memo to tech startups: If you want money, raise it now.” How wrong I was – they had another full year of easy money!) WSJ notes that, of 294 startups that raised more than $50 million in the easy money years, 216 are still private and haven’t raised more money since. (To be clear, some may have raised without officially announcing...) Now, it’s decision time for those 216 companies: Can they raise more money? If not, can they get profitable? If not, can they go public? If not, can they sell? Brand-name, “iconic” companies can raise more money. Enterprise companies can’t, so they’re going public. Everyone in-between is trying to figure out which option they can pull off. Pods are the new blogs: As we learned in the 2015 Ellen Pao trial, it is important for venture capitalists to be “thought leaders.” In the past, they’d do that by writing provocative (but not too provocative!) blog posts, speaking at conferences, providing expert quotes in news articles, hosting meet-ups, and tweeting a lot. To help with the workload, many firms hired increasingly sophisticated teams of communications and content professionals. Sometimes these teams ghostwrite blog posts and op-eds for partners, other times they launch full-fledged publications, like First Round Capital’s First Round Review. Now, they’re producing podcasts! Lately it seems like every firm wants to be in the literal ears of entrepreneurs. Here is a selection of what I’m talking about: a16z podcast by Andreessen Horowitz The Riff by Box Group’s David Tisch and Union Square Ventures’ Andy Wiessman Traction by NextView Ventures Collective Wisdom for Tech Startups by Founder Collective Startup School Radio by Y Combinator Ventured by Kleiner Perkins The Balderton Podcast by Balderton Capital Notion Capital, by Notion Capital Venture Perspectives by Scale Venture Partners Origins by Notation Capital Lead by Menlo Ventures Greymatter by Greylock Partners Bothsides TV by Upfront Ventures The Full Rachet by Nick Moran of New Stack Ventures The Bootstrapped VC by Backstage Capital Human Proof of Concept by Janelle Anderson of CTI Life Sciences Acquired by David Rosenthal of Madrona Ventures These are just the ones I could find that are produced by and feature VC firms and their partners -- people whose full-time job is to invest in startups and thought lead. Today, there's one more for the list: LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock Partner Reid Hoffman has announced a new podcast focused on entrepreneurship called Masters of Scale. Hoffman’s podcast has committed to another form of leadership: It will feature a 50-50 gender balance for its guests. The pledge reminds me of lawyer Ed Zimmerman’s pledge to only participate in four-person panels if at least one of the speakers was female. He also extended the requirement to professional dinner parties of ten or more. As I wrote at the time: Zimmerman said he's had to explain numerous times to critics that this does not mean he now discriminates against men and refuses to support them. He's also fended off less ridiculous criticisms around quotas and affirmative action; he says the "what if the best qualified people are men?" question has been used to justify the status quo for decades. "That is a great way to continue to allow discrimination to persist," he says. "It's just not possible that 90% of the people who are qualified to be venture investors are men, so I don't buy that argument."

Legit Reviews took a quick look at the new AMD Ryzen Balanced plan a couple weeks ago, and we did see a performance increase in a couple of games.  We decided to expand the testing to fourteen games and 3DMark Fire Strike Extreme putting the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X against the Intel Core i7-7700k. The AMD Ryzen is based on the new “Zen” microarchitecture design meant to be used for high performance gaming, while still supporting content creation.  AMD has plans to stick with the Zen design for several years, as they are already discussing the next generation Zen 2 and Zen 3 products.  The initial release of the Ryzen processors features the Ryzen 7 1700, Ryzen 7 1700X, and Ryzen 7 1800X.  All of these are nearly identical with a few differences.  Each of them has 8 cores, and supports up to 16 threads.  The biggest difference comes in the clock speeds with the Ryzen 7 1700 having a base clock of 3.0GHz with a 3.7GHz Boost, Ryzen 7 1700X has 3.4GHz with a 3.8GHz Boost, and Ryzen 7 1800X features 3.6MHz with a 4.0GHz Boost.  The Ryzen 7 1700 also includes the AMD Wraith Spire cooler, while the others do not as AMD assumes people would prefer to use third party CPU coolers or liquid coolers.  The final difference is the inclusion of AMD XFR (Extended Frequency Range) on the -X processor models.  XFR allows the CPU to boost the processor dynamically in 25MHz steps getting the highest possible clock speed for a specific task. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X – $469.99 AMD Ryzen 7 1700X – $384.00 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 – $327.93 The Intel Core i7-7700k was the first flagship processor from Intel based on their Kaby Lake architecture.  The initial release of the Kaby Lake i7 processors, Intel released three models for different purposes, one for mobile, power users, and then an enthusiast class.  The Core i7-7700k is the enthusiast class and has the highest clock speeds and overclocking capabilities.  The Core i7 processor features 4 cores, with 8 threads and has a base clock speed of 4.2GHz with a 4.5GHz. Intel Core i7-7700k – $339.99 Intel Core i7-7700 – $304.99 Let’s take a quick look at the two new test systems we will use in this round of testing. Questions or Comments?

Yeah… You don’t really understand how CPU testing works, do you? realjjj Or maybe you’ve seen so many idiotic tests that you have no idea what you are talking about. The best kind of testing in any area is a real world scenario. When you test at high FPS you don’t highlight anything , you just create artificial bottlenecks, alter the load profile and render the data irrelevant. Flawed methodologies promoted by incompetent reviewers ,that’s what you are asking for. techguy Tell me – why are the results of this comparison different than literally every other 7700k/Ryzen comparison on the planet, even including questionable ones from no-name AMD shills on youtube like joker and mindblank? Did Legit Reviews get a magical Ryzen chip that automatically overclocks to 5GHz on the AIO cooler used in testing? Does it have an HBM L4 cache on-board? You explain the results to me in a way that doesn’t result in the answer “because they used a relatively slow GPU and thus shifted the bottleneck to the GPU”. I’ll give you a gold star if you can do so convincingly and without resorting to ad hominem. Good luck! Jordan Probably because the 1700x is automatically overclocking to its max potential out of the box where as the 7700k is cable of being pushed over 5hz yet the didn’t bother doing that in this review. Steven Kean We didn’t do any overclocking with the processors, these are both run at stock settings. Overclocking results always vary, so we didn’t focus on that at this time. The Intel would be used its boost to 4.5 while the Ryzen would be used its XFR. The scores posted ate the scores we received over multiple runs of each game. We even questioned several of the scores, so we ended up running them multiple times. Its possible that the difference between stock balanced power vs amd Ryzen power could be belong the scores with faster power management, Dante Neck and neck in gaming and Ryzen beats it pretty handily in most non gaming suites. Winner, Ryzen. realjjj Maybe you messed up the graphs(inverted results) and your conclusion certainly doesn’t reflect the numbers but in your numbers Ryzen is ahead in 77% of tests so the conclusion should be that the 7700k struggles. 14 games x 3 resolutions for each and AMD is ahead in 33 tests while Intel wins in 9. Skylake 7600K is able to push 1080 where 1800x cant. thus this $199 CPU offers slight better average fps @ 1440p and this is with shadowplay on most of the time. I am desperately looking forward to better bios and ram compatibility to justify the downgrade to 1800x at least in high end gaming system. My 1800x+Crosshair VI reminds of me early days of X99 platform. MonteCristo Thank you!

Reasons to buy a Linux PC: Support options Excellent out-of-the-box experience Good for beginners to Linux and PC hardware Malware immunity Best Budget Linux Laptops System76 Lemur ($699) System76 is arguably the most well-known Linux PC manufacturer. Their hardware and software excel. Its entry-level Lemur might have a modest price point but it doesn’t skimp on features. The System76 Lemur boasts a 14.1-inch 1080p IPS display and a 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processor; you can snag a Lemur with an i3 or i7. A thin and light laptop, the Lemur comes with either Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or Ubuntu 16.10. It’s available with Intel HD 620 graphics, up to 32 GB of RAM, and as high at 5 TB of storage. Wired allows that while the Lemur comes preloaded with Ubuntu, the hardware is compatible with a bevy of Linux operating systems including Fedora, Mint, and Debian. Furthermore, Wired praises System76 support. Jack Wallen over at TechRepublic commented on the small size and solid keyboard, as well as superb out of the box experience. The Linux Gamer, helping to correct the false notion that Linux gaming is an oxymoron, adds that leaving the F-row as F keys is great particularly for working in terminal apps. However, there’s no LED caps lock indicator. Moreover, the power adapter is a 90-degree angle. This tends to catch objects or occasionally obscure the HDMI port. Additionally, The Linux Gamer found that certain components like the trackpad have difficulty after putting the computer to sleep. But this is likely an Ubuntu issue, and not unique to the Lemur. You may also consider the thin and light ZaReason UltraLap 5330. Similarly specced and priced, the UltraLap 5330 offers more operating system choices including OpenSUSE and Cinnamon. With its superb battery life, light weight, and slim form factor, budget price, and premium specs, the System76 Lemur delivers the best price-to-performance ratio among Linux laptops.

Notably, Network World found that while the XPS 13 ships with Ubuntu 16.04, most other distros run incredibly well. Reviewer Bryan Lunduke noted its ability to run openSUSE, Fedora, Elementary, and Debian. Stellar battery life, lots of ports, and an impressive screen resolution make the XPS 13 Developer Edition an excellent Linux laptop. Lunduke’s only minor quibble: the XPS 13 Developer Edition only comes preloaded with Ubuntu. However as Linux laptops are a rarity, it’s to be expected that distro choices remain limited. Pros Up to 3200 x 1800 resolution 13-inch screen Up to 16 GB RAM (i7) Up to 512 GB SSD (i7) Intel i5-7200U or i7-7500U Runs lots of Linux operating systems Cons Ships only with Ubuntu Best Mid-Range Linux Laptops ZaReason Verix 6440 ($1,500) Image Credit: ZaReason ZaReason’s Verix 6440 strikes a solid balance of performance and price. An i7-6700HQ comes standard as does an Nvidia 1060. What sets ZaReason apart is the customization of distros. You can select from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,  Kubuntu 16.04 LTS, Mint, Fedora, Debian, and in some cases a custom Linux operating system. The Verix 6440 sports stellar specs positioning it as a desktop replacement laptop. However, while Linux operating system options vary, hardware specs are limited. Storage and RAM may be upgraded though. Compare that to the similarly priced System76 Oryx Pro. While the Oryx Pro is limited to Ubuntu only, you’ve got two CPU choices in the i7-7700HQ and 7820HK. Plus, it’s available with a 1060 or 1070 and starts slightly below the Verix 6440. Still, the ZaReason Verix 6440 is a great choice especially for those seeking more distro choices out-of-the-box. Pros Lots of Linux operating system options NVIDIA 10-series 1060 GPU Intel i7-6700HQ Desktop replacement laptop Cons Limited hardware options Purism Librem 15 ($1,700) As a Linux PC manufacturer, Purism is unique for that reason alone. But it’s the software that’s truly revolutionary, although controversial. The Purism Librem 15 is mid-sized and mid-range priced powerful laptop. Purism values security, freedom, and privacy. Hence the root word of “pure” in the company name. The Librem 15 arrives with a fifth gen Intel i7-5557U, up to 32 GB of DDR3 RAM, and Intel Iris graphics 6100. Image Credit: Purism Endgadget appreciated the open-source software and freedom. The operating system is a Trisquel variation. However, there’s definitely a premium. The base model includes a paltry 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB hard drive. Graphics are integrated, not discrete, and the i7 is a dual core processor. Moreover, Purism caused controversy with its laptops. Image Credit: Purism According to a PC World article, the Librem 15 contradicts its open-source promises with proprietary BIOS. Ultimately if your priorities are free and open software, Purism is your best bet. But for the price, you can snag the XPS 13, a Verix 6440, or System76 Serval WS. Check out Jacob Kauffmann’s, AKA Nerd on the Street, detailed Serval WS review. Each boasts drastically better performance than the Librem. Pros Extremely free and open Security-oriented Intel Iris graphics i7-5557U Cons Dual core i7 High price for low specs Proprietary BIOS Poor price-to-performance ratio Best High-End Linux Laptops ZaReason Chimera 3 ($2,048) Image Credit: ZaReason ZaReason’s Chimera 3 is a good workstation-class laptop. It includes a quad-core i7-6820HK paired with a GTX 980M for powerful graphics and computing power. Standard, you’ll find a 500 GB 5400 RPM hard drive and 4 GB of DDR4 RAM. Once again, the Chimera 3 dominates on distro choice. Out-of-the-box options include Ubuntu 16.04, Mint 18, and Kubuntu 16.04. It’s a well-specced laptop with options ranging up to 32 GB of RAM. On top of that, there’s a standard DVD drive — which is a nice touch considering the rarity of optical drives in laptops.   However, the base model comes with a mere 500 GB of storage and 4 GB of RAM. Considering the target audience (power users), the entry level price over $2,000 seems steep. The CPU and GPU, while undoubtedly powerful, are last generation Intel and Nvidia offerings. However, the Chimera 3 features a mini DisplayPort in addition to an HDMI out. If you need those ports, the Chimera 3 should meet your needs. Pros Sixth generation Intel i7-6820HK quad-core processor GTX 980M GPU Lots of distribution options Standard optical drive HDMI and DisplayPort Cons Small, slow hard drive as standard Paltry 4 GB RAM as standard Last generation CPU and GPU System76 Bonobo WS ($2,799) The System76 Bonobo WS earns its “workstation” classification. You can look at hardware specs all day, but real-world applications offer the best insight. Canonical’s Jorge Castro tested the Bonobo WS’s fortitude with a 32 node Kubernetes cluster. The Bonobo barely broke a sweat. While its 16 GB of RAM eventually acted as a bottleneck, the Bonobo comes with up to 64 GB of RAM. On the hardware side, the Bonobo packs a 17.3-inch 1080p screen or 4K HiDPI matte display. Processing power comes via 7th gen Intel i7 desktop processors and up to two 10-series Nvidia GPUs. There’s an available 5 TB of storage. Premium features like a multi-color backlit keyboard further classify the Bonobo as a beastly laptop. Image Credit: System76 It’s tough to find many faults with the System76 Bonobo WS. The Bobobo WS is equally as heavy as it is powerful. It’s a desktop replacement down to its large footprint and impressive girth. Chances are if you’re in the market for a Bonobo WS, you won’t mind the extra pounds. Image Credit: System76 Additionally, it’s not cheap. Yet even the lowest configuration of a Bonobo WS trounces the Chimera 3. System76 also makes the Serval WS which retains 7th gen Intel CPUs and GTX 10-series graphics. Its starting point, however, is $1,899 making it a viable alternative that’s cheaper and more powerful than the Chimera 3. An i7-6700 and NVIDIA 1070 are standard. Plus, there’s one HDMI 2.0 and two mini DisplayPort 1.3 ports. The Bonobo WS might carry a hefty price tag, but it’s certainly worth the money. Pros Up to 64 GB RAM NVIDIA 10-series GPUs (available with two) Desktop 7th gen Intel i7 CPUs One HDMI and two mini DisplayPort outputs True desktop replacement Cons Heavy Not cheap, but great laptop for the price Best Budget Linux Desktops ZaReason Limbo 560 ($650) Image Credit: ZaReason The Limbo 560 is one of the most customizable Linux desktops available. As with other ZaReason PCs, there are several distro choices. But hardware is really where the Limbo shines. The base model comes with an i5-6400, and integrated graphics. Upgrades include as high as an i7-6700k and a Titan X Pascal GPU. For users who want a lot of options, the Limbo 560 delivers. Unfortunately, the Limbo’s base model is pretty underpowered. The power supply is a mere 350 watts which should be sufficient for integrated graphics. If you tack on a dedicated GPU, especially the $1,500 alone Titan X, you’ll need to swap that for a better PSU. Additionally, there’s no optical drive standard and the entry-level model only has a mere 4 GB of RAM and 500 GB hard drive. ZaReason’s Mediabox 565 is a solid alternative. Pros Highly customizable hardware Lots of distro choices Up to Titan X GPU As high as an i7 Cons Low entry system specs System76 Meerkat ($499) The System76 Meerkat is a pretty neat device. It’s an Intel NUC but includes Ubuntu standard. The Meerkat includes a 6th gen Intel i3 or i5 for the CPU, and up to 2.5 TB of storage space. This tiny PC is energy efficient and space-saving. A small footprint and low power consumption make the Meerkat an excellent choice for an HTPC, media server, or HTPC-media server combo. An avid Plex user, I ranked the Meerkat among the best Plex server devices available. Yet the Meerkat isn’t as upgradeable as a traditional desktop. You’re stuck with integrated graphics and you can’t upgrade the CPU. RAM and harddrive upgrades are totally feasible, but that’s about it. Additionally, you’ll probably want to future proof and go with the i5. Nevertheless, the Meerkat is a great, affordable, energy efficient budget Linux PC. Pros Small footprint Energy efficient Up to 2.5 TB hard drive space 6th gen Intel i3 or i5 Cons Can’t upgrade GPU or CPU Only available with integrated graphics i3 not as future proof as i5 version Best Mid-Range Linux Desktops LAC Portland Lenovo ThinkStation P310 Image Credit: Lenovo LAC Portland Lenovo ThinkStation P310 is an excellent midrange desktop. Although the ThinkStation is technically a workstation or server, it’s a mid-tower desktop. The P310 boasts a beefy Xeon E3-1245 v5, 8 GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 1 TB 7200 rpm harddrive. There’s lots of room for expansion inside the case. Plus, for distro fiends, the P310 is available with a smattering of Linux operating systems. In addition to the newest Ubuntu releases, it’s available with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, several flavors of Fedora, Debian, and OpenSUSE. LAC Portland’s array of devices comes with a three-year on-site warranty at no charge. But that doesn’t quite help those who aren’t nearby. Additionally, the starting price only includes 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB harddrive. The Xeon is a very capable CPU, but there aren’t upgrade options for the CPU or for a dedicated GPU. Still, these are user upgradeable. The entry price just below $1,000 is good, but not great. However excellent hardware that’s compatible with a range of distros and a CPU that offers maximum reliability makes the ThinkStation a solid mid-range Linux desktop. Pros Xeon E3-1245 v5 CPU Up to 64 GB RAM Lots of distros including unstable and older releases Good onsite support User upgradeable Cons Three-year warranty is onsite only No GPU or CPU upgrade options Maingear Drift ($1,099) Steam Machines were the brainchild of Valve. Unfortunately, these didn’t quite take off and have yet to replace console gaming. That’s largely because of strong, but not widespread, Linux gaming support. Steam Machines run a Debian-based custom distro, SteamOS. It’s not a perfect operating system, but if you’re into Linux and gaming, the Maingear Drift is one of the best mid-range PCs you can get. Image Credit: Maingear While the Maingear Drift is well equipped on the hardware front, SteamOS is rather limited. There’s no file manager or image viewer. There’s some streaming support in the browser, and you can playback local music. But overall it’s a PC built for gamers. If you’re a Linux gamer, the Maingear Drift is arguably the best Steam Machine available. The Alienware Alpha is a good alternative. However, the Alpha is limited in its upgradeability. Similarly, the Zotac Zbox Steam Machine features a GTX 960 and SteamOS but you can’t upgrade the GPU or CPU. Image Credit: Dell PC Mag awarded the Maingear Drift a 3.5 out of 5 in its review. In its review, PC Mag liked the RAID storage, small footprint, and 4K gaming capabilities. However, they also noted that it’s not the fastest running 1080p resolutions. Additionally, opting for the Titan X really drives up the price. Pros Small form factor VR-ready i7 CPU Up to 6 TB hard drive space As high as 16 GB DDR4 RAM Available with a Titan X Cons 1080p gaming isn’t the fastest Titan X costs a major premium Best High-End Linux Desktops System76 Silverback WS ($2,199) The Silverback WS is a workstation class desktop. With a just over $2,000 starting point, even the base model comes well-equipped. Inside you’ll find dual Xeon E5 v4 CPIs, up to 1 TB of ECC RAM, and as high as 64 TB of storage space. For GPUs, the Silverback offers NVIDIA 10-series GTX cards, Tesla, or Quadro configurations. Plus, there’s an option for an independent PCIe NVMe Ubuntu install. Image Credit: System76 I had the pleasure of viewing the internals of the Silverback WS and was truly impressed. The whopping nine hard drive bays sent me into a daydream about setting up an array of hard drives in RAID and how many concurrent transcodes the dual Xeons could handle. But the Silverback is suited to much more than just a media server. It’s beefy enough for tasks like machine learning. In short, if you want a top-tier desktop, look no further than the Silverback WS. On that note, the Silverback WS is a bit overkill for the average user. Additionally, the ECC RAM sports better reliability than traditional RAM. It’s also more expensive. Therefore if you plan to upgrade later, you’ll pay extra for the ECC However if you’ve got the cash to shell out, it’s an amazing workstation. Chances are if you’re dropping over 2K on a machine, you actually need the horsepower. The P410 30B3 from LAC Portland clocks in at just over 1K and features a Xeon v4 CPU. Granted, it’s got less computing power and the sticker price reflects that. Pros Dual Xeon E5 v4 CPUs Choies oc GTX 10-series, Quadro, and Tesla GPUs Up to 1 TB ECC RAM As high as 64 TB or storage space. Cons Only Ubuntu available ECC RAM is pricey Expensive system albeit well equipped Puget Obsidian ($1,959) Image Credit: Puget Systems Puget Systems has a pleasant selection of Linux capable PCs. The Obsidian’s standard build uses an Intel E3 v5 Xeon processor, 16 GB of DDR4 ECC RAM, Intel P530 integrated graphics and your choice of Linux distro. You can snag an Obsidian with CentOS, Mint, or Ubuntu. The Obsidian is truly an excellent device and arrives pretty decked out even in its stock. Image Credit: Puget Systems The only minor quibbles I can think of are that it’s pretty pricey at almost 2K. Again, it’s got ECC RAM which while more reliable is more expensive. Still, Puget’s Obsidian is a beast of a high-end desktop/server class Linux PC. Pros Xeon E3 v5 CPU Up to 64 GB ECC RAM GTX, Titan, and Quadro GPUs available Several distros available Cons ECC RAM is pricey Final Thoughts and Alternatives Although these are the best Linux laptops and desktops available across an array of budgets, there are plenty of other options. ZDNet features a stellar write up on five Linux desktop vendors. Eight Virtues Among these, Eight Virtues provides a hybrid pre-built and do-it-yourself option. Rather than pre-selected systems, you choose the parts and distro on your own. Choices though are admittedly limited. You’re relegated to a handful of AMD CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. Price goes up a lot. An AMD FX-8350 powered PC with a GTX 750, 1 TB hard drive, and 16 GB of DDR3 retails for almost $900 as per adding items to my cart. Image Credit: Eight Virtues Emperor Linux Image Credit: Emperor Linux Emperor Linux sells a lineup of high-end PCs. Mostly you’ll find Dell and Lenovo machines. There are custom versions of Linux based on the likes of Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE, openSUSE, Fedora, Debian, and Slackware. Moreover, older iterations are available. Prices are a bit high for the hardware, but you’re getting a quality device with lots of operating system options. ThinkPenguin ThinkPengiun provides Linux laptop and desktops. But while they offer some of the lowest prices, the hardware is a bit budget. For basic tasks like internet browsing and streaming, these are likely fine, however.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Mobileye, Intel’s $15.3 billion computer vision acquisition, partners with Nissan to crowdsource maps for autonomous cars Paul Sawers@psawers April 25, 2017 5:19 AM Image Credit: Mobileye Mobileye, the Israeli computer vision firm that’s currently in the process of being acquired by chip giant Intel for $15.3 billion, has announced a new tie-up with automotive giant Nissan to generate “anonymized, crowdsourced data” for precision mapping in autonomous cars. Founded in 1999, Mobileye builds the visual smarts behind cars’ driver assistance systems that include adaptive cruise control and lane departure warnings. Its technology is already used by the likes of BMW, Volvo, Buick, and Cadillac, and last summer Mobileye announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to put self-driving cars into full production by 2021. The trio later committed to putting 40 autonomous test cars on public roads in the second half of 2017, before Intel went all-in and decided to buy Mobileye outright. For self-driving cars to become a reality, carmakers and the technology companies they work with need access to accurate maps of roads and the environment around which autonomous cars will operate — these high-definition maps complement on-board sensors and add an additional level of safety. Mobileye’s existing Road Experience Management (REM) engine is essentially a mapping and localization toolset that can use any camera-equipped vehicle to capture and process data around geometry and physical landmarks, send it to the cloud, and then feed this back into autonomous car systems using minimal bandwidth. It’s basically a crowdsourced data collection effort using millions of cars already on the roads. Mobileye already powers Nissan’s recently announced ProPilot, a system that’s similar to Tesla’s AutoPilot offering, which can already automate some car functions on the road, including steering and acceleration. And with Nissan recently kicking of its first self-driving car trials in London, it seems now is the time for Mobileye to work with Nissan to boost its crowdsourced mapping efforts. This adds another major automaker to Mobileye’s existing roster of REM partners, which include the previously announced General Motors and Volkswagen, while the likes of Audio, BMW, and Daimler are on board via their ownership of the HERE mapping platform that partnered with Mobileye last year. The more carmakers sign up to integrate Mobileye’s REM, the more data can be combined to scale the system to cover every locale where humans drive.

Wednesday 26 Apr 2017 / Tehran - 11:28 / GMT - 06:58 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology http://fna.ir/R6NF8P Tue Apr 25, 2017 4:20 Optane Memory Review: Why You May Want Intel's Futuristic Cache in Your PC Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- This next-gen memory technology greatly increases responsiveness of PCs, but only for those who still want to use a hard drive. Intel’s Optane Memory gives mainstream users a rare first bite at the bleeding edge of technology. No matter how much hardcore PC enthusiasts yell, scream, and gnash their teeth, they're not going to be using this as standalone storage just yet. Instead, Optane Memory debuts as a caching drive that can—at times—make a hard drive competitive with even the fastest SSDs. If this seems too good for your dog-slow drive to be true, don't worry. We ran the benchmarks, and you can see the results for yourself. You can also see the caveats in the system requirements, which unfortunately bar the vast majority of PCs from this speedy upgrade.  Setting up Optane To set up Optane, you simply drop it into the M.2 slot, install the drivers and application, then pair the drive with your primary boot drive. The Optane software moves some OS files to the Optane drive itself to aid in faster performance. If you decide to remove the Optane drive, you must unpair them so you don’t lose files. Once installed, the Optane memory drive will be invisible to the OS, and only your hard drive will appear in the File Manager. This is actually one key advantage that Intel touts for Optane, and I’d agree. While a more advanced user can manage having a small 240GB SSD with a 2TB hard drive, the typical person just wants to save files to the primary drive and call it a day. Optane Memory caching for, say, a 4TB drive would be a lot easier for those folks. How we tested To test Optane Memory we used an Intel-provided system with a quad-core Core i5-7500, 16GB of DDR4/2400, and an Asus B250 Prime motherboard using the Intel B250 chipset. Intel provided the system sans-GPU, so we dropped in a budget Radeon RX 480 for all of our testing. For storage, Intel provided a 1TB Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive with Windows 10 installed, and a 32GB Optane memory module in the M.2 slot. To get a feel for how Optane Memory would do against the best, I installed a $629 Samsung 1TB 960 Pro NVME M.2 drive in a PCIe slot. Obviously, Optane is aimed at mainstream-level technology, so I also tested with what I’d consider the opposite of the 960 Pro. With its TLC NAND and limited cache The 960GB Toshiba Q300 SATA SSD is technically an SSD, but it posted disappointing results in our review, often performing like a hard drive. Although other TLC-based drives aren’t the dog the Toshiba Q300 is, budget SSDs may get worse as QuadLevel Cell NAND is introduced. Still, the question today is how an Optane Memory-accelerated hard drive will perform. The Optane control panel is pretty bare-bones right now. CrystalDiskMark Performance Our first test is the synthetic CrystalDiskMark 5.2.1 benchmark that’s built on Microsoft’s DISKSPD server and cloud storage performance testing tool. I ran the test on the bare Western Digital hard drive, as well against the same hard drive with the Optane module for caching. I also ran it on the Optane drive itself configured as a standalone 32GB SSD, plus the Toshiba Q300 and Samsung 960 Pro SSDs. The first result you see here is a sequential read performance using 1MB block sizes and a queue depth of one. As far as workloads go, this would be like reading or copying a single file from your drive. As you can see, the pricey Samsung 960 Pro buzzes along with read speeds around 2.5GBps. The Toshiba Q300 is held back by the SATA 600 interface, with read speeds of about 546MBps. The Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive plods along at 165MBs. Optane Memory, whether configured as a standalone non-caching SSD or used as a caching drive for the Western Digital Drive, turns in a consistent performance of 1.3GBps.  The sequential read speed of the Optane memory either cached or standalone easily outstrips the Toshiba Q300 SSD but can’t touch Samsung’s 960 Pro. Although the read speed of the Optane memory is relatively healthy, write speeds are less impressive—closer to that of a low-end SSD, worse even than the Toshiba Q300. Synthetic benchmarks aren’t everything, though, and we’ll cover the weaknesses of budget SSDs vs. Optane in a few paragraphs. Either way, write performance on Optane memory is nothing to write home about. In pure sequential writes using a single thread, Optane memory doesn’t wow us. The thing is, to wring the most out of an NVMe SSD with multiple channels, you really need high queue-depth workloads (high queue depths are basically multiple simultaneous requests of the drive).  Here’s the performance of our drives reading 128KB blocks with a queue depth of 32. The Samung 960 Pro is simply smoking, with read speeds of 3.3GBps. Intel’s Optane drive set up as a small SSD also gives up a decent, but certainly not as impressive score of 1.4GB. When configured as a cache drive it’s pretty much identical, with a score of 1.4GB. The Toshiba Q300’s performance is essentially constrained by the SATA interface with read speeds of 562MBps. And yeah, the hard drive gives up a “blazing” 169MB read speed. The read performance, however, of the Optane drive as a cache and standalone is far better with a 1MB block-size load and queue depth of 1. One argument against using high queue depths as a measurement of SSD performance is that few consumer workloads ever actually match that. Intel says concentrating on high queue depths just isn’t realistic, and many reviewers would agree. This excellent Tom’s Hardware primer by Andrew Ku shows that loading and playing games, for example, are “almost completely at a queue depth of one.” Another argument Intel makes for Optane is its performance on small 4KB blocks. Configured as a standalone SSD, the Optane module offers substantially higher performance with small files with a single queue depth. In fact, even the mighty Samsung 960 Pro gets its lunch eaten here. Running the Optane module in its cached mode we also see a significant performance advantage. And yes, the plain Western Digital hard drive is basically moving as slow as a snail here, with a score of 0. One of Intel’s arguments for Optane is off-the-hook latency when reading small files with very low queue depths. Optane as a cache for the hard drive also destroys both SSDs, including the mighty Samsung 960 Pro.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army's Artillery Units Pound Terrorists' Positions in Northern Hama Syrian Army Gains Ground in All-Out Assault on Al-Nusra, East of Damascus Province Aleppo on Track to Recovery after Terrorists Defeated Iraqi Popular Forces Begin New Military Operations South of Mosul Iraqi Forces Continue Offensive against ISIL in Western Mosul Hezbollah's Missile Attack Destroys Terrorists' Command Post in Lebanon's Arsal Region SARC Distributes More Humanitarian Aids among People in Jibreen, Deir Ezzur Clashes Hit Indian-Controlled Kashmir Storm Sweeps Tehran War of Choice: It Is Time for the West to Take Questions from the Middle East Calls Made to Boycott Israeli Products as Palestinian Prisoners Continue Hunger Strike Israel Demolishes Naqab Bedouin Village for 112th Time UN Deeply Concerned' over Safety of 400,000 Civilians Fleeing US-Led Coalition Airstrikes in Raqqa FSA, ISIL Resume Clashes in Qalamoun More Civilians Killed in US-Led Coalition Airstrikes in Northeastern Syria Syrian Army's Artillery Units Pound Terrorists' Positions in Northern Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian Army troops supported by heavy artillery fire continued their advances against terrorists in Northern Hama, reaching the gates of a strategic militant-held town near the border with Idlib province.

The last time a new major memory was introduced, it was 1999. NAND revolutionised how digital memory would evolve over the next decade and a bit, but in 2015 Intel and Micron finally announced a new point: 3D Xpoint. It’s taken two years to actually deliver a product that uses the technology, but Intel’s Optane Memory could squeeze some life from your old, slow HDD. Right now SDD, or flash, memory is the fastest non-volatile digital memory you can buy (well, excluding the first 3D Xpoint drive, which costs $1500 for just 375GB), but it’s still wildly expensive for large drives. A 2TB SSD still reaches prices like $559, while the HDD variant doesn’t even break $100. But the speed difference between the two is astronomical, and playing a larger role in games, video editing applications and just the general speed of your system. Intel Optane, then, is the middle-man. launching is 16GB and 32GB sizes, the 3D Xpoint memory acts as a sort of cache between your processor and your HDD. Just like Hybrid HDDs have done in the past, the Optane memory stores information that it thinks will be important for work you’re currently doing. Just like system RAM, except that it doesn’t forget when you lose power. That makes recurring system boots faster, games load quicker, and hair on your head stay there when Photoshop doesn’t take over a minute to open. Intel has lofty ideas of just how much faster this makes your operating speed, but in practice, the effectiveness can vary. Since it’s a cache, the Optane inclusion doesn’t really help the speed of applications that are opening for the first time. And since the biggest size is 32GB, it’s easy for memory to run out and lapse when you have a lot going on. But when it works, it works well. Gizmodo found in their tests that the combination of an HDD and Optane can (in most cases) reach SSD performance. That’s staggering, considering a 32GB chip only costs $77. The only drawback really is compatibility. Intel Optane is only being supported by 7th-generation Kaby Lake Processors, and then an even smaller list of motherboards are Optane ready. That list might grow, but it still means only PCs with the most recent CPUs can take advantage. Intel promises that more laptops and pre-built desktop systems will start shipping with Optane support built in, but it does lessen the impact of the chips on the market today. But if you’ve just built a new PC and aren’t yet ready to shell out for massive SSD drive, Optane provides a neat middle-ground for the time being. It’s not an effective measure to stay as SSD prices decrease, but it’s in interesting first step in the long history that 3D Xpoint is only just getting started with.

Here's a look at five of his worst whoppers. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) In a wide-ranging interview with Julie Pace of the Associated Press on April 21, President Trump yet again made many false or misleading statements. Here’s a roundup of 14 claims. As is our practice, we don’t award Pinocchios in roundups. “I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It’s actually a little bit more than that, but it’s $725 million.” Trump keeps claiming he saved hundreds of millions of dollars on the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes by intervening in negotiations with Lockheed Martin. But Lockheed already had planned cost reductions, and Trump overstates his role. In a Dec. 19 briefing — before Trump began meeting with Lockheed’s chief executive Marillyn Hewson — the head of the Defense Department’s F-35 Joint Program Office announced costs would come down “significantly.” The average unit price for the planes has been declining for years, and the Pentagon had wanted to reduce costs further. The cost savings for the latest batch of planes was projected to be between $549 million and $630 million for a full lot of 90 planes.  The Pentagon announced that the total savings from the program will be $728 million. This marks the 14th time Trump has made this false claim, which earned him Four Pinocchios. “President Xi [of China], from the time I took office, they have not been currency manipulators.” Trump falsely claims China stopped devaluing its currency since he took office. China had not devalued its currency for about two years prior to his election. China artificially kept the value of the yuan, or renminbi, low for many years. But now, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economies. From August 2015 through August 2016, China sold more than $570 billion in foreign currency to prevent more rapid depreciation of its currency, according to estimates by the Treasury Department. Yet throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly accused China of being a “world champion” of devaluing the yuan. We gave that outdated claim Four Pinocchios. As president, Trump flip-flopped on this matter and decided he would no longer label China a currency manipulator. We rated this key economic campaign promise “Broken” in our Trump Promise Tracker. During his presidential campaign Trump talked tough on China, accusing them of undervaluing the yuan. The International Monetary Fund has said that Chinese currency is "no longer undervalued". Does China still deserve to be called a "currency manipulator"? (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) “You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. … As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, ‘Only because of you am I making this massive investment.’ Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that.” Trump likes to claim undue credit for corporate decisions that were made before he was elected president. We keep a running list of such claims here. And Trump exaggerates the number of jobs created since he became president; the number of net new jobs since January 2017 is 317,000. Ford’s decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico had more to do with the company’s long-term goals than with the administration. Ford outlined these goals in a contract it negotiated with the United Auto Workers in 2015. General Motors announced job plans in January and March 2017, but the company did not credit Trump or his election. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona. The company announced its investment in this factory in 2011 with President Barack Obama, but it never opened. Intel is resuming its factory project because it anticipates a demand in computer chips that will be created there. As for the Chinese e-company Alibaba, its founder Jack Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015. “It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we’ve ever had.” This is doubtful. The biggest tax cut since World War II appears to have been Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, which was valued at 2.89 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the Treasury Department. Assuming a $20 trillion GDP in 2018, Trump’s tax cut would need to be valued at least $580 billion a year in order to exceed the size of the Reagan tax cut. President Trump is talking up a "big announcement" on tax reform slated for April 26, after months of pledging to make drastic changes to the tax code. The Post's Damian Paletta explains why tax reform is so complicated. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) “When WikiLeaks came out … never heard of WikiLeaks, never heard of it. When WikiLeaks came out, all I was just saying is, ‘Well, look at all this information here. This is pretty good stuff.’” Trump falsely claims he had not heard of WikiLeaks prior to the 2016 campaign. As CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski found, Trump denounced WikiLeaks as early as 2010. “Oh, I’m seeing numbers — $24 billion [for a border wall], I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. That’s not a lot of money relative to what we’re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in — and we’ll stop all of it.” During the presidential campaign, Trump used to claim that he could build a 1,000-mile-long wall, made of precast concrete slabs 40 feet high, for $8 billion. The Fact Checker checked with construction experts and instead received estimates as high as $25 billion. A report issued by Senate Democrats in April came up with an even higher estimate: nearly $70 billion, before paying for land acquisition. The report said that maintenance costs would run about $150 million a year. Trump’s claim that the wall would halt the flow of drugs is dubious. Experts say that drugs are actually shipped through the border on the underside of vehicles that have permits to cross the border in a special lane. “As long as the U.S. remains the world’s largest consumer of coke, and as long as Mexico continues to provide it, no wall will ever be able to stop the trade,” wrote Roberto Saviano in Newsweek. “Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days.” In a speech on Oct. 22, Trump issued an unusually detailed 100-day plan of action, which he called the “Contract with the American Voter.” The Fact Checker has used the plan as a template for tracking in campaign promises. Trump told the AP that “somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan” — but that was Trump himself. On NATO: “It’s not fair that we’re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they’re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I’m very strong on it, and I’m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.” The United States spends about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product on defense, far more that NATO’s guideline of 2 percent. The median spending level in 2016 for the 28 NATO countries is 1.53 percent of GDP, according to NATO, though NATO members are not expected to reach the 2 percent level until 2024. Meanwhile, the United States has defense responsibilities around the world, especially in Asia, which accounts for why U.S. spending is higher. In fact, U.S. bases in Europe are often used to redeploy forces in other theaters, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. “You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.” When NATO was founded in 1949, terrorism had long existed in Europe, often carried out by separatist groups (such as Irish Republicans) or anarchists. A bombing in 1867 in London by the Irish Republican Brotherhood killed 12 people and injured 120. “The electoral college is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it’s very, very hard.” Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called blue wall — the Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent presidential elections. But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system require fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state such as California. Since Democrats tend to be concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes is dissipated. This is one reason that in two recent elections — 2000 and 2016 — the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the electoral college to the Republican. “On any, on air, [CBS ‘Face the Nation’ host John] Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It’s the highest for ‘Face the Nation’ or as I call it, ‘Deface the Nation.’ It’s the highest for ‘Deface the Nation’ since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It’s a tremendous advantage.” Trump is slightly off on the numbers. Then-presidential candidate Trump’s Jan. 3, 2016, interview with host John Dickerson on CBS’s “Face the Nation” had an audience of 4.6 million. Of the total audience, about 1 million were adults aged 25 to 54, the coveted demographic among advertisers. The overall audience was the largest since Sept. 16, 2001, and the rating among adults 25 to 54 years old was the best since Nov. 17, 2013, according to CBS News. “I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don’t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.” Trump’s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded that the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,” though it noted “there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.” As for farmers in Wisconsin being “killed” by NAFTA, Canadian dairy products are actually not covered by NAFTA, as that industry is protected from U.S. exports and remains under “supply management” (price controls) which results in high retail prices in Canada. Canadian consumers basically subsidize farmers; by contrast, American dairy producers receive subsidies from the U.S. government. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) “said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.” Cummings has disputed this account, as the AP noted to Trump. Cummings told CNN that he said Trump he could become a good president “if . . . IF . . . he took steps to truly represent ALL Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on.” “So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers, and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.” Immigration advocates and lawyers say a “dreamer” (beneficiary of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program) has been deported under Trump’s broadened enforcement guidelines. The government disputes that the dreamer was deported. In any case, Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump is arresting an increasing number of people with no criminal records, indicating that not only criminals have been targeted by his administration. According to The Washington Post’s analysis, the biggest spike in arrests of undocumented immigrants from Jan. 20 to March 13 was of immigrants with no criminal records.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Intel Intel’s insanely fast new Optane SSDs are finally shipping Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 24th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet The biggest advancement in data storage technology to date has undoubtedly been the shift from disc-based hard drives to solid-state. SSDs are faster, with no moving parts, and generate less heat while also typically being considerably smaller than their platter-based counterparts. SSDs are already a step up in almost every way, but Intel decided it just wasn’t happy with the way solid state technology was headed, and somehow managed to one-up the rest of the industry with an SSD that is faster than pretty much anything else on the market, and now they’re shipping. Don't Miss: Apple’s actual iPhone 8 design may have just leaked for the first time The Intel Optane P4800X is the first product from the company to utilize the new 3D XPoint memory technology. It utilizes a PCIe slot, and has a capacity of 375GB, but other sizes ranging from 750GB to 1.5TB have already been confirmed by Intel as being in the pipeline for 2017 releases. It’s significantly faster than NAND-based flash storage with a small fraction of the latency, and while it’s slower than DRAM, it’s also ten times more dense. The new drive technology is also a whole lot more durable and, unlike flash data storage, 3D XPoint won’t physically degrade the storage media, allowing it to be written upon many more times than NAND-based drives without as much concern for overall drive health. So, Intel’s Optane drives are awesome and way faster, longer-lasting, and better than SSDs… but you knew there had to be a catch. All this cutting edge technology doesn’t come cheap, and if you were considering picking up a P4800X for your own rig you should know that it’s primarily designed for data center use and, due to its price, it’s pretty much only an option for enterprise applications, at least for now. The debut drive will set you back a cool $1,520, and for just 375GB of storage, that’s not exactly budge-friendly. Still, the technology is extremely promising and will surely find its way to home computers before too long.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel Optane Memory launches for $44 and up (speedy cache compliments your hard drive) 04/24/2017 at 2:32 PM by Brad Linder 10 Comments Intel’s first consumer-grade 3D Xpoint memory solution is going on sale this week. First unveiled in March, Intel Optane Memory is basically a small solid state drive using a new type of memory technology and designed to be paired with a hard drive to offer the best of both worlds: the large storage capacity of a HDD and the speedy read/write times of solid state storage. Intel currently offers a 16GB module for $44 or a 32GB version for $77. So is Intel Optane Memory worth the money? Maybe. As Ars Technica points out, $77 is kind of a lot to pay for 32GB of storage in 2017. And if you’re going to spend that kind of money, you might be better off just buying a 120GB or 250GB SSD. While Intel claims its Optane Memory is faster than most traditional NAND Flash solid state drives, that’s only true if your system is only using Optane Memory. And Intel is really positioning these first drives as caching companions for hard drives. That means that sometimes your computer will benefit from Optane Memory. But sometimes you’ll still have the slow read/write times of a hard drive. There are certainly some situations where it might make sense to use Optane Memory + a hard drive rather than just using a solid state drive. For instance, if you need more than 250GB of storage, SSD prices can get pretty high, while hard drive prices are relatively low. So if you want to store a huge library of games, high-resolution videos, or other content, then it’s probably a lot cheaper to buy a 1TB or larger hard drive and use an Optane cache drive than to get a massive SSD. It’s also worth noting that Optane Memory does not provide a way to speed up old computers, because it only supports computers with Intel Kaby Lake Core i3 or faster processors. So you’ll need a relatively recent system (or at least a recent motherboard). PC World also notes that a high-end Samsung 960 Pro SSD currently offers better performance than Intel Optane Memory in several different benchmarks, but the Optane system handily outperforms hard drives and some cheaper SSDs, which could make it a cost-effective way to give a PC a bit of a performance boost. And as usual, if you want some really detailed thoughts about Intel Optane Memory, check out AnandTech’s writeup. Possibly the most exciting thing about Intel Optane Memory is what this week’s launch portends for the future. It’s likely that Intel will eventually offer Optane storage in higher capacities, making 3D Xpoint technology a viable alternative to NAND Flash for laptop and desktop solid state drives. At that point, rather than boosting the performance of systems with hard drives in some situations, Optane storage will offer permanently faster read/write times, longer endurance, and other improvements over existing SSDs.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 10 Comments on "Intel Optane Memory launches for $44 and up (speedy cache compliments your hard drive)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Matthew Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Almost 6 years ago I bought a traditional 7200 RPM 500GB drive but with an 8GB SSD cache so Windows and recently played games always loaded really fast.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. An SSD cache built into a SATA drive is going to be limited to SATA speeds (600 MB/s for SATA III). The 32GB Optane can push twice that at ~1,225MB/s (verified in testing) since it’s running over NVMe which can go up to 3,938MB/s.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Not the only difference. The SSD cache, just like any SSD have a limited write count (3000-10000), and as with any NAND memory, it can only be written as a whole block, so even if you only want to change one bit, in the worst case scenario you’d still have to write out 4096 bytes. Optane on the other hand have significantly more write cycles (the current models range from 30000 to 1 million), and each bit can be individually addressed. They are also faster, the current cheap cache models offer about 2-3 times the performance of an average consumer-grade SSD, but the higher end server-grade models can reach 10 times that, possibly even more in the near future, given the proper connection (not an USB3 port 🙂 ). Basically it’s non-violate RAM. Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 18 hours 30 minutes ago Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I doubt there are any Kaby Lake chromebooks out there yet, the chips are still pretty pricey for that.

The real potential for Optane memory technology comes when it develops to the stage that it starts to drive a revision to the current bus architectures that connect data storage devices to the CPU.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. You can’t judge this product vs ordinary SSDs. For one thing, the memory is much faster than SSDs. Secondly, the small sizes they come in have a purpose: these are meant to act in conjunction with a large hard drive for large SSD to speed up disk operations. In other words, adding this to a computer with a slow 2TB hard drive, would make that 2TB drive behave almost as fast as an SSD, and a fraction of the cost of a large SSD.

"I want to tackle head-on the notion that the Nasdaq is overvalued, something we heard a lot of chatter about today because the index blasted through the 6000 level, and whenever we crash through big round numbers, it tends to cause instant soul-searching," the "Mad Money" host said. When the Nasdaq sees a big run, people tend to recall the last time it skyrocketed, Cramer said. In this case, it happens to be early 2000, when the index approached 5000 then dived thousands of points, crushing a whole class of investors. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer compares the 2000 dotcom bubble bust to today's market moves    8 Hours Ago | 11:33 To Cramer, the comparison feels somewhat forced. The companies that drove the Nasdaq to 5000 back then ended up either being overvalued or, in Cramer's words, "plain old worthless." So the "Mad Money" host decided to compare the leading stocks' future price-to-earnings multiples to see whether there is any weight to the argument that today's market is too pricey. In 2000, tech giants were already running the show. Microsoft traded at 59 times earnings, Cisco at 179 times earnings, Intel at 126 times earnings and Oracle at 87 times earnings. Now, Microsoft trades at 20 times earnings, Cisco at 13 times earnings, Intel at 17 times earnings, and Oracle at 16 times earnings. "When you consider that the average stock in the S&P 500 sells for 21 times earnings, not only are these four tech stocks ridiculously undervalued versus their prices back then, they're actually cheaper than the average stock in the S&P right now," Cramer said. When the tech bubble burst it dragged those market leaders into oblivion. But today, all four are considered value plays complete with regular stock buybacks and good dividends at a fair price. Cramer understands why some investors worry about market leaders like Amazon and Netflix, which appear to have inflated valuations like the once-doomed tech stocks did in 2000. But the "Mad Money" host is not convinced that this means the online powerhouses are due for a crash. "Amazon has the greatest sales momentum of all time," Cramer said. "I've never seen a company this large grow so fast in a market that's worth trillions upon trillions of dollars worldwide." Even in 2000, investors would pay up to Amazon's multiples for growth. But Cramer noted a key difference: unlike the growth stocks then, Amazon has huge cash flows and makes billions. "It just chooses to keep spending that money so it can grow even faster," he said. Netflix strikes Cramer as an opportunity stock, one that has massive growth potential that investors will also cough up cash to buy. As the streaming giant cracks into new global markets, it attracts eager money managers along the way. Moreover, the other stocks in the Nasdaq's top 10 biggest names are also relatively cheap. Apple trades at 14 times 2018 earnings and has a large dividend, big buyback, and lots of cash. Alphabet, parent of Google, may seem expensive, but at 18 times earnings is cheaper than the average and also has a mountain of overseas cash as well as a large buyback. Facebook sells at the average price of a Nasdaq stock. "Now, some of you might say, 'Wait a second, all of these stocks could still prove to be wildly overvalued if the global economy turns upside down,'" Cramer said. "But right now, things seem to be doing just fine, and they could be getting even better if President [Donald] Trump can push his tax cuts and repatriation plans through Congress." So as the indexes continue to rally, Cramer insists that you do your homework on the companies that market players have deemed too expensive. "Even though the Nasdaq 100 is up 14 percent year to date, I refuse to call it overvalued not only versus 2000, but compared to many other eras that I have to admit seemed a lot less risky," Cramer said. "One more reason to stay the course and do some buying if this darn market would ever give you a pullback." Questions for Cramer?

But what if you could get an Optane Memory drive for free with your next motherboard purchase - that could be a buying decision swaying variable to seriously consider. MSI today announced that it will exclusively bundle a pre-installed 16GB Intel Optane Memory drive with a trio of new 200 Series motherboards. The offer represents $50 additional value, says MSI. It has suffixed these as the 'OPT BOOST' motherboards, and they are as follows: Z270 TOMAHAWK OPT BOOST B250M BAZOOKA OPT BOOST B250M PRO OPT BOOST (sorry no product link as yet) The first two motherboards listed above come with twin Turbo M.2 slots so even with the Optane drive in place you still have room for a fast PCIe SSD card. With regard to the B250M PRO OPT BOOST, I think it only has a single M.2 slot, as three very similarly named motherboards on the MSI site are thus specced. With the Optane memory installed in these boards users should experience "up to 14x faster" hard drive performance. On such a HDD + Optane equipped system there will be big benefits to be reaped in time savings during systems boot, application launches, and more. The main attraction is that users are said to be able to "enjoy SSD levels of performance and keep the large storage capacity". Lastly MSI reminds consumers that all its 200 Series motherboards support Optane but please make sure to download and update with the latest applicable BIOS. Intel Optane Memory reviews are starting to trickle forth. Only yesterday The Tech Report published its own review of a 32GB version of the above bundled drive. It tested an Optane + HDD (WD Blue 1TB) combo system against a similarly priced storage solution consisting of just an OCZ Trion 150 480GB SATA SSD. In the tests the two competitive storage systems performed pretty closely - with the Optane combo a little ahead, more often than not. First run times seem to be the Optane Achilles' heel though. However the 32GB version will presumably be able to cache many more apps/games data after the initial run than the 16GB MSI giveaway version. Related Reading 5 JEDEC says DDR5 and NVDIMM-P standards will be ready next year DDR5 memory will provide double the bandwidth and density over DDR4. 27 Intel Optane cache drives don't play with budget Kaby Lake CPUs 7th gen Intel Pentium and Celeron chips cannot make use of Optane technology. 17 Intel launches 16GB and 32GB Optane Cache modules These M.2 modules will become available from 24th April, for $44 and $77 respectively.

Posted by Xlucine - Tue 25 Apr 2017 15:59 The B250M boards included are quite cheap (£60-70), so this looks like a very tasty offer for a budget system (as long as you aren't hoping to use one of the hyperthreading pentiums) Posted by GinoLatino - Tue 25 Apr 2017 16:06 To me, as it is right now, optane is a near to useless gimmick. Posted by Millennium - Tue 25 Apr 2017 18:13 I like the idea of Optane and wish they would bring it to Series 6 (Skylake / Z170) as I have one and would buy it if it would work. It's cheap for what it is, and I well remember the benefits of extra cache from upgrading from 4mb to 8mb in DOS on my 486. lol Posted by OilSheikh - Tue 25 Apr 2017 20:48 So, Optane is the SSD bit of a Hybrid SSD+Hard drive combo ? They should have had it as Onboard RAM instead Posted by HW90 - Tue 25 Apr 2017 21:15 GinoLatino To me, as it is right now, optane is a near to useless gimmick.I'm going to assume you haven't seen any of the benchmarks yet then. Although I'll admit it could be better for gamers, but that seems to be a storage size problem rather than a ‘what it does’ problem.

Image Credit: Claremont Hotel Here’s the updated preliminary agenda for our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event coming on May 1 and May 2 at the historical Claremont resort hotel in Berkeley, California. The event is GamesBeat Summit 2017: How games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic.You can secure your seat here. Use the “Deantak” code at checkout for 20 percent off. We think we’ve built a unique slate of speakers and experience that you won’t find at any other event. We’re excited that most of the key slots are filled, and we’re in talks with various parties to fill the rest of the slots and bring you a great conference on the inspiration cycle that is happening between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. We’re going to do an event for the geeks in all of us. It’s about the inspiration cycle that happens between games, real-world technology, and games. It’s like how Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel, Snow Crash, inspired virtual worlds and spawned a thousand game startups, and how people like Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, are still talking about Snow Crash today. I still remember Will Wright telling me, “A dog-eared copy of Snow Crash is the business plan for every startup in Silicon Valley.” We’re also going to hear from John Underkoffler, science advisor for Minority Report. He will talk about the gesture-controlled computer that inspired things like the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect. He will also join a panel with John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs and creator of Pokemon Go, and Ralph Osterhout, CEO of ODG, maker of augmented reality glasses. Now we are getting our material from new shows like Westworld, where, as Tony Parisi noted in his recent speech, we will be immersed in a future where we can’t tell what is real and what is not. We’ve also got inspiration from the big screen coming, with the upcoming film Ready Player One, a Steven Spielberg movie based on the book by Ernest Cline. I explained this idea for a conference to Jamil Moledina of Google Play. He once ran the Game Developers Conference, he’s a science fiction novelist himself, and he immediately got the idea about how people are thirsty for inspiration from across industry lines. That’s why I asked him to be emcee at our GamesBeat Summit. As a community, we’ll be searching for the next big thing, wondering what will happen in this cycle as real-world technology catches up to the visions of science fiction and games, and figuring out how we’ll move it forward. If you’re interested in sponsoring, message mike.sly@venturebeat.com.

(AAPL) Faces iPhone 8 Delay as Galaxy S8 Shatters Sales Records What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen View All Posts At this point in time, it almost seems as though Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) have switched positions.  Mere months ago, everything that could possibly go wrong seemed to be hitting Samsung, while AAPL took the smartphone sales crown and rode a wave of optimism about the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone 8 launch. Source: Samsung But with U.S. Galaxy S8 sales up a whopping 30% over last year’s Galaxy S7 pre-orders, and more signs of iPhone 8 delays, momentum seems to have shifted to Samsung. Samsung Announces Record U.S. Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders Speaking to VentureBeat, Samsung confirmed that Galaxy S8 sales are on track to put the Galaxy Note 7 far behind it. In fact, according to Samsung, Galaxy S8 pre-orders smashed the previously record-setting Galaxy S7 pre-orders in the crucial U.S. market by 30%. Samsung told the publication: “The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are a result of that recommitment and the market has responded — with a more than 30 percent year-over-year growth in pre-orders versus the record pre-orders we had with Galaxy S7, making it our best ever. The response is humbling, energizing and points to a great launch week.” Samsung hasn’t yet released any numbers beyond the 30% claim, but it seems confident that Galaxy S8 sales are going to be huge. Meanwhile, More Rumblings of an iPhone 8 Delay While Samsung celebrates, Apple is reportedly continuing to struggle with production challenges that seem increasingly likely to result in iPhone 8 delays. There have been rumblings that the advanced technology AAPL is incorporating in the iPhone 8 is causing problems at the manufacturing stage. There has been speculation that the new iPhone might not launch until October or November as a result, raining on Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone parade. The latest bad news on that front comes from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Mac Rumors reports the analyst — who is typically positive about Apple developments — is now joining the camp predicting an iPhone 8 delay due to production issues. Kuo isn’t suggesting Apple will miss its September launch target, but is predicting the iPhone 8 will face “severe supply shortages” that could push consistent retail availability into 2018. Record Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, iPhone 8 Delay Not in AAPL’s Script Limited supplies is not what Apple wants for the iPhone 8. With the iPhone 7S and the iPhone 8 expected to launch in September — accompanied by the iPhone’s 10th anniversary hype and a bruised Samsung — this was supposed to be an upgrade super cycle that would smash records. Unfortunately, the plan is going sideways. After the massive wave of bad PR caused by the Galaxy Note 7’s fire-prone batteries and the subsequent botched recall program, Samsung’s overall phone sales slid enough in the aftermath that Apple was able to dethrone it in Q4 2016 as the world’s top smartphone vendor by volume.

By Rajiv Rao for New Tech for Old India | April 25, 2017 -- 13:19 GMT (06:19 PDT) | Topic: Tech & Work Agiloft CEO Colin Earl is a 25-year veteran of software industry who worked at IBM, General Electric, and several start-ups before founding Agiloft, a Silicon Valley contract and workflow management firm, in 1991. Earl spoke with ZDNet recently about why he thinks that the US is chasing away the entrepreneurs who will form the next wave of Googles and Microsofts amidst a severe shortage of tech talent and what the US needs to do to urgently to assure itself of a leadership position in tomorrow's tech future. You've been a vocal critic of the current round of moves in the US to rein in the H-1B visa for skilled workers. Could you extrapolate? I think the restrictions on the H1-B visa are a form of economic suicide. Jobs follow engineers. The impact of not allowing the brightest and the best into the US to work for US companies, to form US companies, and eventually to possibly become US citizens will be devastating. It's not that those jobs are going to Americans. American tech graduates with engineering degrees and computer science degrees or who are experts in systems admin are already fully employed. Today companies in Silicon Valley are poaching jobs from one another which is already incredibly disruptive to product development. Take for example a H-1B visa holder working for us - he is, in all likelihood, not getting his visa renewed and will return to China. He has an extraordinary skill set as well as an intellectual aptitude and capability. That job will go with him and in all likelihood we will be asking him to find other people like him with strong computer science and engineering backgrounds to work for us from there. Fact is, we have been trying to fill that position and others like it for the past year. We are better rated on Glassdoor than Google which is one of the best companies to work for than. We offer excellent pay, attractive stock options, 401 k, but we still can't fill that position. But isn't the current legislation trying to do just that - prevent outsourcing companies from scarfing up all the visas leading to scarcity for people like the employee you just mentioned? You can address that not by restricting H-1B visas but by increasing the minimum pay necessary to qualify for such a visa. Make it an unlimited number but everyone working here has to earn at least $75,000 a year. Make that your salary floor.That addresses the core issue head-on. You will get people with appropriate skill sets. You will allow tech companies to grow. Today Apple and Intel are forming tech centres abroad. Intel has a huge research and development presence in India. Microsoft has a massive campus in Vancouver. Jobs follow top talent. If you don't allow top talent to percolate in the US you are exporting jobs. In the long term, which is about 10 years in hi tech, you will be exporting the next industry. People will increasingly be trained and brought up to highest levels of tech excellence in Vancouver and China and India, where they will leave their employers to create the next Google and Facebook -- but they they will do it there. They will pay taxes abroad and contribute to a foreign economy. In the long term, you are creating competition to American tech giants. That is beyond bad, it is catastrophic. But isn't Trump, to be fair, trying to keep people who have graduate degrees from good institutions to stay behind? Could it be that he's not communicating what he wants well enough? special feature Digital Transformation: A CXO's Guide Reimagining business for the digital age is the number-one priority for many of today's top executives. We offer practical advice and examples of how to do it right. Read More I suspect he does want that, but like many politicians he wants several things that are contradictory. He wants to appease unemployed workers in America - large swathes who are suffering, especially in the rust belt. He wants to assure them that he is stemming the flow of foreigners coming in to take their jobs. But he is also talking to bankers and hedge fund managers more than he is talking to people that he really needs to talk to like companies in the tech sector. I am no socialist. I am a Silicon Valley CEO for God's sake! America has to invest in education, especially in engineers, computer scientists, systems administrators and spend money on making it affordable for sons and daughters of coal miners and steel workers to get a first rate engineering education, to train them for jobs of the next century. Doing so will pay for itself many times over. That provides a long term solution to the problem. It will make it virtually impossible for cheap outsourcers to flood the market once they have competition from well-qualified American graduates. Today, we're desperately short of talent. Americans with computer science degrees straight out of college are earning well over $100,000 a year - and they are useless! Let me tell u, I've been in this industry for thirty years and was one of these individuals once. The firms that are employing them do so thinking they will become useful a year from then, after a year of training. Do you think there is a shortage or a surplus of the lower-end system engineers and app developers? There is a shortage of people who are worth employing. Absolutely, there is a shortage of folks that a company would feel good about employing. There is an adequate supply of B-, C+ players and what happens is that employers are so desperate that they will hire a dozen or so in the expectation that two or three will be worth keeping. Agiloft has a technology stack that removes the need for manual programming. So we can employee people who are just very smart. They don't need a degree in computer science or whatever. I'll give you an example. We employed a very smart girl with a degree from Princeton who was working in a dental office as an office manager earning $40,000. We gave her an aptitude test which she nailed and she's now earning $80,000. So, all you need is a logical mind -- you could have a degree in philosophy, for instance, and make it to your firm or another similar place in the Valley today. Absolutely! One of our top people has a Phd in musicology. She is doing enterprise implementation for companies like Chevron. Do you see that as the future for the tech world? Increasingly, yes. That, coupled with the development of AI. The required skill set is always evolving. What is the sense from where you sit of what companies are going through in this talent drought that you are talking about? There's a sense of despair at not finding American workers in Silicon Valley. Companies have pretty much given up on the notion that they can build a work force that can communicate with one another physically. There are very few exceptions. Google and Apple and Facebook are earning so much money, at revenues between $0.5 mill to $2 million per employee, that they can afford to employ people in Silicon Valley. For the rest of us, companies are giving up on notion of having work force that comes into same office each day. Instead we are employing people wherever we can find the talent. Agiloft is small company but we are advertising in Canada, advertising positions here in the Valley, North Carolina, India, China, New Zealand, wherever we can find people -- and everybody else is doing the same thing. Microsoft is building campuses abroad and every tech company is either doing or trying to do the same thing. And it's not just tech - accounting firms are doing it! Almost everyone who can is employing folks remotely, from home offices or starting satellite offices. So what kind of immigration policies would you implement if you were in the 'hot seat?' I would have an open door policy for hi-end tech talent that was able to command salaries of $100,000 in places like the Valley. I would raise the floor for the H-1B visa but have a significant increase in visa numbers for folks in the $75,000 plus range. I would take money from folks who will never work again - the retired and elderly and I would put that into training young people. As a politician I would probably never be able to state it - if you look at how much government is spending in the last ten years of a person's life versus youngsters in their first twenty years - the numbers are completely out of whack. The former will never pay off. The latter always does. So what do you say to the American techie who says that he or she cannot get a job and that their jobs are being replaced by cheap labour from abroad? I'd say its rubbish! Let me give you an example of a guy that we employed. He wanted to become a programmer. He didn't have training and went off to a 12 week - not even a 2 or 3 year course - but a 12 week bootcamp on coding and is now a programmer. That's all it took for him to get a job. Of course, the guy was smart. And it goes without saying that of course engineering and computer science is not a career you can follow unless you have the mental aptitude for it. However, these jobs are your's for the taking if you have some basic training and aptitude for it. So what you are saying is heartening for all those American tech workers out there - that it's never been better to be an engineer, that if you do the right things and are smart enough, there are plenty of jobs out there for you. Oh, absolutely! We're employing people north of a $100,000 a year who don't even have a college degree. Linux systems administrators with no college degree and just a high school degree with some experience are thriving.

Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, his 100-day vision was said to have been met with a crowd "as silent as a group of mourners around a grave." More than 80 years later, a similar shroud of muted pessimism has fallen over Silicon Valley, as leaders stifle their vitriolic opposition to President Donald Trump. And yet most technology CEOs have quietly managed to walk the line between ideological defiance and tacit cooperation over the first 100 days of Trump's presidency — to great success. In fact, the tech-heavy Nasdaq on Tuesday crossed the 6,000 mark for the first time ever. In contrast to the struggling farmers of 1930s California, today's Silicon Valley is the land of $400 juicers and on-demand massage. Indeed, the technology sector has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump presidency: The S&P information technology group has risen more than 14 percent this year, more than banks, utilities, health firms, energy companies or consumer brands. It's up more than 10 percent since the inauguration. Trump takes office, a rally boosts tech Despite loud opposition from tech firms to many of Trump's policies, investors have hoisted many tech stocks to all-time highs since the election. Shares of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet have hit one all-time high after another in 2017. The Nasdaq 100 has hit higher levels than ever, and the IPO market hit a seven-quarter high in terms of capital raised, according to Renaissance Capital. To be sure, many trends have been at play — a holiday shopping season that favored online retailers and advertisers, some better-than-expected earnings reports, and broad market gains. Consumer sentiment popped after the election, as it becomes "more difficult to disentangle political fervor from what appears to be a growing sense among consumers that the economy will experience fundamental changes," according to Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan. But by the end of last week, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook accounted for the bulk of the gains in the S&P 500. Analysts also believe that tech companies are likely to be some of the top beneficiaries of Trump's proposed policies, especially tax reform. Cisco is likely to be a top beneficiary of lowered taxes on the repatriation of foreign cash, according to research from Strategas Research Partners. Apple could also be a winner, according to Baird's Will Power. Tech angst swirled around Trump ... All this is surprising because prior to Inauguration Day, Silicon Valley made no secret of its distaste for Trump, criticizing his policies on immigration and equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community, as well as his rhetoric on trade. Box CEO Aaron Levie declared Trump "the scariest person in America," "obviously unelectable," and compared Trump's debate performances to "someone who's drunk at trivia night at a bar." Conservative HP boss Meg Whitman defied her political party to call Trump a demagogue that "undermined the fabric of our national character." The discontent filtered up to the ranks of the world's richest and most powerful companies. Amazon's Jeff Bezos said Trump's behavior "erodes our democracy around the edges" and joked he'd like to "send Donald to space." Anti-Trump protesters gathered at the headquarters of Google and Uber. Apple, Airbnb, Facebook, Intel and others filed a legal brief opposing a since-blocked executive order banning U.S. entry for refugees and citizens from certain Muslim-majority countries. Executives who broke from tech's bastion of opposition faced immense scrutiny. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to scrap a Trump fundraiser in the 11th hour. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Y Combinator's Sam Altman fielded calls to boot Trump-ally Peter Thiel from their boards. Uber's Travis Kalanick chose to leave Trump's business advisory council after it was "misinterpreted" as an endorsement of the president — and an Oracle employee publicly resigned when CEO Safra Catz failed to follow suit. ... but then CEOs walked it back Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images (L-R) Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump attend a meeting at Trump Tower December 14, 2016 in New York. Perhaps unsurprisingly, tech CEOs have softly warmed to Trump amid the stock market bounce. Levie told CNBC he wanted to bridge the divide with the new administration. Whitman has also committed to give Trump "the benefit of the doubt." Bezos tweeted that he wishes Trump "great success." And Amazon has made 10 job-related announcements in the five months since the election — versus nine in the entire year prior to the election. Like Bezos, many of Trump's harshest critics in tech touted American job creation, trotting tail between legs to the White House and currying favor with the administration, sometimes to the chagrin of their employees. Despite opposition to Trump's travel ban, Krzanich took to the Oval Office to promote his creation of 10,000 new jobs — even though it was first announced during the Obama administration. Salesforce's Marc Benioff — who openly backed Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton — told Trump that he hoped to create 2 million jobs, perhaps more "if we all came together and unified to create a great program with your leadership." More meetings have happened behind closed doors, with Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Tesla boss Elon Musk joining the administration's new White House Office of American Innovation. Others in tech have silently squirreled away their winnings, staying out of the political limelight. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke out about the travel ban but has since demurred from commenting on the president's tweeting. Zuckerberg, lambasted over whether "fake news" on social media swayed the election, managed to pen a 6,000-word salvo on society without singling out Trump. show chapters Should you still bet on big tech, post-earnings?    Friday, 21 Apr 2017 | 5:30 PM ET | 06:10 Arguably, money speaks louder than words — technology companies have spent more on lobbying than ever under the new administration, according to documents compiled by BuzzFeed News. Still, critics of the industry are beginning to demand that CEOs put more on the line. Ellen Pao, a former venture capitalist and CEO who has been vocal about workplace equality, has called on Dorsey and Y Combinator's Altman to take action. The disconnect between Trump voters and "coastal elite" technology companies has highlighted that for all their election-season bluster, the industry has plenty of work to do on diversity, gender equity, and poverty within its own ranks. Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher called the CEOs "sheeple," participating in "behind-the-scenes jockeying for what they really want." Tech investor Chris Sacca told Swisher that the CEOs were being "used to legitimize a fascist." "CEOs should remember that their employees look up to them, and if they feel like their employer is not going to speak up and represent their interests — whether it's transgender issues, women's rights issues, the environment, immigration — I think it's a missed opportunity," venture capitalist Bijan Sabet told Swisher. "I think [this election] was a wake-up call." Correction: This story was revised to correct the spelling of Sam Altman's last name.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman A Diverse Workforce is an Agile Workforce: Computacenter on Digital Transformation Computacenter and Intel have come together to present a new people-based approach to user adoption of new technology and digital transformation in the workplace, with a focus on managing workforce diversity. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE If companies want to have a diverse workforce, they must remember that people will adopt new digital platforms at different speeds. Managing diversity in the workplace means carefully considering the ways people want and need to work and presenting new solutions in a way that supports that, giving people time and encouragement to transition to newer technologies. Tessa Swithenby, Director of Communications, Engagement, and Education at Computacenter, argues, “A technology-centric approach is self-defeating. A people-centric approach is liberating. People understand that they are at the heart of the strategy, and so they invest their time and talents in achieving it. By focusing on people, the organisation makes it clear that the technology is there to serve them, not the other way around.” While there may have traditionally existed a divide between workplace technology and everyday technology, now people are coming to expect their workplace tools to be simpler, easier, and more attractive to use. When technology is challenging and frustrating, it keeps people from being productive. While upgrading to better technology is one aspect of digital workplace transformation, it’s not the whole story. It’s also about changing the mindset and culture of the workplace—integrating that technology in such a way that encourages users to embrace and utilise new digital tools at their disposal. Steve Rayner, Computacenter’s Group Service Innovation Director asserts that “it’s important to develop workplace solutions as if the users [your employees] have a free choice about whether they will use them or not. And they do have a choice: they could use their own [introducing the challenge of Shadow IT], or they could simply leave for an employer where they can work the way they want to.” Everyone needs help learning and adopting new technology; it’s not about digital natives versus digital novices. The technology should be there to support the work people do so that they will want to contribute their talents and efforts to generating great ideas and making great things happen. It is in the interest of workforce diversity that companies approach digital transformation and user adoption from a people-first standpoint—that’s how you begin to have an agile workforce. Diversity in the workforce means a broader talent base, which in turn means more productivity, efficiency, and creativity across the entire organisation. Considering the different ways people work and introducing technology in a way that supports rather than limits that will spell more success in user adoption, yielding returns for the company financially, and in a very human way.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Sponsored Nightdive turns games of the past into a bright future…virtually VB Staff April 25, 2017 4:10 AM Image Credit: Nightdive Studios Presented by Intel Many game companies open up an office space, get a development team together to work in that office, grind away for a couple of years to create a new intellectual property (IP), then put the product up for sale through retail outlets and digital-distribution sites, such as Steam. Hopefully, profit follows, so they can do it all over again. Nightdive Studios, on the other hand, took a drastically different path, and its website reveals that core mission: “Bringing lost and forgotten gaming treasures back from the depths…” By acquiring the rights to already-released games, updating them to work on contemporary platforms, and offering the revamped games through direct-distribution outlets, Nightdive can avoid having to lease office space, and it doesn’t need to employ dozens of local employees to facilitate the work. The development company operates a virtual office environment, which means the people involved in updating and coding the games don’t need to move from their respective countries, or even their homes. All of that contributes to Nightdive’s profits, which the studio uses to, indeed, do it all over again…and again…and again. A shocking trip Nightdive was founded in late 2012 by Stephen Kick, now Nightdive’s CEO. Back then, Kick was a character artist with Sony Online Entertainment, but was getting a little tired of making games for others. He decided to embark on a world trip to find new inspiration, and, like many travelers, he brought some games with him — in this case, some classics from his youth. Above: Stephen Kick Image Credit: Nightdive Studios “One night, I was playing — or attempting to play — System Shock 2, and I couldn’t get the game running,” Kick explains. “I went online, attempted to purchase the game (on GOG.com), and I discovered there was no legal way to commercially buy the product. So, I did some digging, and discovered that the IP had been transferred to an insurance company after Looking Glass Studios had gone out of business. I approached [the insurance company] about digitally re-releasing the game on GOG, Steam, and other digital platforms, and that was pretty much the birth of Nightdive Studios.” Kick says the success with the System Shock 2 re-release was the first step for the newborn company, but it quickly led to “finding other games that were lost to time,” and following the same procedure to bring them back to market. As the classic song goes, “Everything old is new again,” and Nightdive is proving that to be quite true with its retro games. The studio has over 100 products in its catalog — available on Steam, GOG, and Humble Bundle’s Humble Store — including, The 7th Guest, Shadow Man, Space Rogue, and the Wizardry series. “Our inspiration really lies in all the games that we grew up with and that we remember fondly,” Kick says, “and our desire to replay those games, preserve them for future generations to enjoy, and just to continue, I guess, the stewardship of making sure these games are available for everybody to play again.” Out of the fog In March 2017, Nightdive brought out its latest release: Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. This first-person shooter debuted in 1998 on the Nintendo 64 console, courtesy of Acclaim Entertainment, and ported to Windows a year later. Nightdive has already released its Turok 2 update on PC, and is also working on a port to the Xbox One console. Above: Split-screen multiplayer action in Turok 2 Image Credit: Nightdive Studios One of the features Nightdive has included is for Turok 2 to be playable on almost any PC. That enables players on a wide variety of systems to still be able to enjoy a stable game with high visual fidelity. “It’s interesting…we worked in cooperation with Intel, using their toolsets; Intel provides a variety of different software tools to optimize your game performance,” says Larry Kuperman, Nightdive’s director of business development. “One of the things we found with the Intel set, we were able to make sure that [Turok 2] would play on the widest spectrum of computers available, so that if you wanted to fire up Turok on your laptop on the way home, it would play smoothly.” Another change Kuperman points out has to do with the game’s viewing distance. Because of the constraints of the processors in the late ’90s, the original game-developers used fog to limit the distance the player could see ahead, which enabled them to provide highly detailed graphics at a relatively short distance. However, nearly 20 years on, with the increase of CPU power and video cards, distance-limiting fog wasn’t needed. Above: Larry Kuperman Image Credit: Nightdive Studios “We were able to roll back the fog, and give the game a whole new visual treatment,” Kuperman explains. “These are not games that are intended to compete with the highest-end, highest-requirement games out there, but, visually, they’re certainly appealing.” Another Nightdive development team is working on a reboot of System Shock. Nightdive has managed to acquire full rights to the game, so the studio is rebuilding it from the ground up using the Unreal Engine. “The ultimate goal for us acquiring the license,” Kick says, “is to be able to reintroduce the franchise to the current generation of gamers. That really kicked off around the end of June [2016], when we launched our Kickstarter. We were able to raise 150% of our goal for a total of $1.35 million in order to faithfully reboot the first game in the series.” Their virtual reality Nightdive’s virtual office environment means that the studio has people all around the world working on projects. As Kick explains, this means that development happens on pretty much a 24/7 basis, with tools (such as GitHub, JIRA, and Slack) enabling collaboration and communication across the team. Software enables managers to track each person’s contribution to make sure everyone is generating what they need to for the project. Kick bemoans some of the tradeoffs — such as the lack of in-office socializing and camaraderie — but Kuperman counters that the distributed office means there are no complaints that a co-worker cracks his knuckles or plays her music too loudly. Kuperman feels that this is a great time to be in game development, with changes to the creation process enabling end-to-end benefits. With crowdfunding platforms, such as Kickstarter and Fig, it’s easier for a studio to work on a project without needing to make a deal (and share future revenue) with a publisher. Game engines, such as Unity and Unreal, are incredibly powerful, but also free to use until you start selling the product you’ve created. And there are a bunch of digital-sales platforms on which to retail a product, so a developer can self-publish quite easily. Even if the developer opts to work with a publisher to bring a product to market, Kuperman says there are still benefits from those tools. “A developer can be relatively self-sufficient and come to the publisher, saying ‘Look at what I’ve produced so far. Is this something that you’d be interested in?’ So you have all those things out there — you have a very robust ecosystem for games development now.” Sponsored posts are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

While the notebook makes some compromises , it offers an excellent package at an affordable price. Just like its other lines, Lenovo has brought the latest and greatest from Intel to the ThinkPad 13. The 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs are available in several flavors, although choice is limited to the low-voltage U class reserved for ultrabooks. Our review model is a base-level model. It sports an Intel Core i3-7100U, Intel HD Graphics 620, 4 GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 128 GB M.2 SATA SSD. Aside from the internal components, nothing has changed from last year’s model. The excellent keyboard , ample port selection, and lightweight MIL-STD-810G rated chassis remain the same. As such, we will forego detailed looks at the case, maintenance, and input devices. Further detail on these parts of the notebook experience can be found in our 2016 ThinkPad 13 review. This review will be primarily concerned with the performance changes brought by Kaby Lake.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed What happens when a vendor doesn’t patch its software? 24 Apr 2017 11 Microsoft Post navigation Previous: Ransomware hidden inside a Word document that’s hidden inside a PDF Next: LinkedIn app’s oversharing via Bluetooth sparks alarm by Danny Bradbury 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Microsoft engineers won’t be happy this month, thanks to the community-minded actions of a Github user named Zeffy. Not content with the way that Redmond was updating its software, he decided to patch Microsoft’s patch. Zeffy is irritated with Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer CPUs. The company, which worked hard to push users to upgrade to Windows 10, announced in January last year that it would not update versions of these older operating systems running on seventh-generation processors (that’s Kaby Lake silicon from Intel, and Bristol Ridge silicon from AMD). A select set of products using sixth-generation Skylake processors would continue to get support until the middle of this year, it said. On April’s patch Tuesday, the policy finally took effect. Microsoft’s update messages told users of older operating systems using seventh-gen chips that their combinations of Windows version and CPU were not supported. Windows 7 and 8.1 users running Intel seventh-generation Core processors, along with AMD “Bristol Ridge/Ryzen/Zen,” and Qualcomm 8996 chips are being locked out of updates, according to Bleeping Computer. “A giant middle finger” In the Readme.md file on his Github repo, Zeffy calls this “a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. He took matters into his own hands, expanding the Microsoft update file so that he could see all the update files it contained. Then, he excluded all the binaries that were related to Windows Update, leaving him with 14 files. He compared those with the ones already on his system, and found one file containing two functions: IsDeviceServiceable and IsCPUSupported. He patched the file to bypass those functions, preventing Windows Update from checking to see whether it liked the host CPU or not. This isn’t the first time that one person has patched another’s software. Naked Security has already written about Operation Rosehub, a volunteer effort by 50 engineers patching open source projects that used a flawed version of the Apache Common Collections library. Many projects used this code, including WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Jenkins. No one came to patch many open-source projects relying on the Apache library, so Google stepped up. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Another example of guerrilla patching is 0patch, a project from Slovenian consulting firm Acros Security. This approach uses what the firm calls “micro-patching“, in which the binary isn’t modified at all. Instead, the patches are in-memory changes, typically shorter than a tweet, that block malware trying to exploit a particular vulnerability. The idea is to quickly patch binaries against specific exploits before the vendor can. In many cases, it can be easier to install a targeted in-memory patch than to try and test a bundle of different patches that will affect binaries directly, explained Acros co-founder Mitja Kolsek. Working around inadequate patching policies These different approaches to guerrilla patching highlight existing problems with software updates. 0patch has appeal because it’s an easier way for enterprise admins to protect their software without relying on binary patches that may break the systems. The project has now issued more than 300 patches for various products, many of which were not zero-days. Like 0patch, Operation Rosehub has appeal because in some cases, vendors simply don’t patch vulnerabilities quickly enough. In Google’s case, the problem lay with open-source projects for which no single person has responsibility. This highlights one of the key problems with open source: many eyes may eventually start a problem, but no one may step up to fix it. Zeffy’s case highlights something different altogether: selective patching, designed to support a vendor’s own agenda at the expense of its users. Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on current-generation processors furthers its own agenda, which has always been to force as many Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10 as possible. Microsoft explains this by arguing that developers would have to work too hard to support “Windows 7’s expectations” when running on newer silicon. Nevertheless, it in effect holds users of older versions to ransom, which is what irked Zeffy so much. This is unfortunate, because fighting the security battle is already hard enough. We should be able to rely on software vendors to support their products on all platforms until their official end of life. Microsoft has vowed to offer extended support for Windows 7 – which includes security updates at no extra charge – until January 2020. Windows 8 gets extended support until January 2023. If patches themselves become a battleground, and users who don’t want to upgrade their OS must begin hunting around for tools that let them patch vendors’s own patches, then system protection – already a complicated and uncertain process – becomes even more daunting for that vast majority of users that simply wants to feel safe when using their operating system. Zeffy’s irascible fix might not be the last.

If all our parents followed this dorks advice and use his patch, we will be expected to fix the issues. Everyone knows that eventually you must upgrade your hardware. Hey, where is my patch I want Windows NT back? Geeeeeese come on. Reply Andrew says: April 24, 2017 at 7:25 pm If Microsoft didn’t want to update Windows 7 until 2020 and Windows 8 until 2023, they shouldn’t have said that. Zeffy going around the “older CPU” block to get patches for his system is irrelevant. This is an issue with Microsoft not updating older operating systems, as they said they would, using hardware as the deciding factor. I personally don’t find Windows 10 the “steaming pile” that Zeffy thinks it is, however if I had a 7th gen CPU and wanted to continue using Windows 7 or 8, I shouldn’t require a special process to do so. Microsoft is advancing their agenda to get people to upgrade to Windows 10 if on newer hardware or risk being vulnerable to security deficiencies on their operating system. Bottom line is that Windows 7 and 8 are not at their End Of Life dates and as such, should continue to receive security patches.

MS is more like a dictator than a product. Oh sure they make a crippled version for home users, that just adds commands to limit things, but its still the same crap, not better performing. Back when,,,, we hacked XP down under 70mb in memory and it rocked for gaming (would have been good for work too if we hadn’t taken all print function out) If MS doesn’t make a better product, someone else will, and will take their market (fingers crossed sooner than later).

Reply Don Funkhouser says: April 25, 2017 at 1:10 am Not a chance. Linux still doesn’t allow users to run the software that they need. No Adobe, no real Presentation software (like for churches, concerts, etc.), poor multi-monitor support beyond 2 screens, lack of fully featured office apps (no macros in the linux alternatives), lack of top games, I could go on and on. Reply Pingu says: April 25, 2017 at 11:57 pm Linux still doesn’t allow users to run the software that they need Well if you need to run a “Windows” programme you have to use (the correct version of) Windows or emulation – like when you need to run a “Mac” (or DOS) programme under Windows. If however your needs are expressed as “general functionality” there are numerous Linux options (the problem if anything is too many options) So – if you “need Adobe” as in “reading and writing pdf’s” there are alternatives to “Acrobat” that run under Linux (and Windows). – if you need “Adobe” as in “photo-editing”, why aren’t you using a Mac – which is probably better than Windows or Linux (which does have photo editing software) – if you need “Presentation” software (like Powerpoint), Open Office has Impress which certainly meets my needs for projected “slides”. – Open Office or Libre Office are both “fully featured” office suites – albeit they use options other than “MS VBA” for “programming” (Open Basic, Javascript, BeanShell, Python). – I have never gone beyond two screens but would expect there to be solutions out there (Search “Linux Multi-screen”) – Games? Yeah, Linux isn’t intended for the “top games”. But is Windows best for games or is a dedicated games system a better bet? Some Linux users curse Windows for not providing the functionality they need! Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Skinny bundles do not a revolution make By Rich Jaroslovsky • 04/25/17 6:00am Sooner or later, someone will come up with a sleek, savvy reimagining of television for a mobile-centric, constantly connected audience—but we aren’t there yet. Unsplash/Frank Okay Remember “reinventing television?” Apple was supposed to do it. Or Google. Or maybe Comcast. Or seemingly 100 start-ups, each with its own vision of cable-cutting channel packages, interactive program guides or whatever. And yet here we are in 2017, still cursing at our service providers while deciphering clunky “smart-TV” (what a misnomer!) interfaces, juggling remote controls and selecting different HDMI inputs depending on where the content is available. (“It’s on Amazon Prime…wait, there’s no Apple TV app for that…”) At a time when television content is going through a new Golden Age, with more sources of quality programming than ever before, television access is arguably worse than ever. The biggest innovation is the advent of the “skinny bundle”—scaled-down versions of traditional cable packages delivered via the Internet at prices that, once you factor in all the add-ons, only look good when compared to the incredible inflation of traditional cable and satellite bills. A lot of the problems around TV were supposed to have been solved by now. Not long before he died in 2011, Apple founder Steve Jobs famously confided to biographer Walter Isaacson that he had a vision for “an integrated television set that is completely easy to use … I finally cracked it.” That set the stage for years of rumor and speculation that an Apple-branded set was on the verge of release, with billionaire investor Carl Icahn forecasting that the company would sell 37 million sets by now. Actual number of Apple-branded TVs sold: Uh, zero. The company shelved its plans a couple years ago, and Icahn dumped his position in Apple last year. Then there was Intel. You couldn’t imagine a more unlikely candidate to reimagine television than the chipmaker, but the cloud-based service it developed, called OnCue, was an ambitious effort to deliver pay-TV channels side-by-side with online content. OnCue generated a good deal of Silicon Valley buzz in 2012 and 2013, and Intel had even begun showing it off in private to select journalists. But the company abruptly shuttered the project and sold the technology to Verizon, apparently scared by the cost of acquiring content. The list goes on and on. There was TiVo, which pioneered the digital video recorder but struggled for years to break the cable and satellite companies’ chokehold on the market for set-top boxes; it finally sold out to software-and-data company Rovi last year. (While the buyer has taken on the TiVo name, it is getting out of the hardware business in favor of licensing its technology to others.) Then there’s Aereo, which delivered over-the-air TV via the Internet to mobile devices—busted by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case brought by the broadcasters. You get the picture. TV has so far proven itself largely immune to reinvention; it says something that even the famously hidebound auto industry is a bigger magnet for Silicon Valley energy and innovation these days. Certainly, not every effort has petered out. Comcast, for instance, has continued to enhance its Xfinity X1 platform, adding seamless Netflix access last year and promising something similar for YouTube. But Comcast is, after all, still at its core a cable provider with all that entails, including high prices (the average monthly bill, which may include other services besides TV, is now over $150) and a sometimes uncertain grasp of the concept of customer service. For instance, though I was an early X1 adopter, it wasn’t until I questioned the system’s limited functionality on several TVs in my house (no DVR features, no Netflix) that I learned there was new equipment available to address the problems. There are still experiments going on in the TV space—but they don’t tend to come from anyone you’ve ever heard of, and it remains to be seen whether they will have much of an impact. For example, Cheddar, a business-oriented online video operation aimed at social-media-savvy millennials, is partnering with (of all people) Dunkin’ Donuts to give away digital antennas. The idea is to use over-the-air signals to get their online content onto TV sets, showing I guess that everything old is new again. Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for the television industry to successfully address larger trends—like the explosion in video consumption on mobile devices, where users tend to prefer shorter programs that are formatted to be viewed vertically rather than sideways. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former Disney and Dreamworks executive who’s raised some $600 million for his next venture, called WndrCo, says creating such “new TV” is the biggest opportunity he sees right now. Sooner or later, someone will come up with a sleek, savvy reimagining of television for a mobile-centric, constantly connected audience. But we aren’t there yet—and, as with so many other tech issues, we shouldn’t mistake a clear view for a short distance.

A Diverse Workforce is an Agile Workforce: Computacenter on Digital Transformation 2017-04-25 Print Tweet   Computacenter and Intel have come together to present a new people-based approach to user adoption of new technology and digital transformation in the workplace, with a focus on managing workforce diversity. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE If companies want to have a diverse workforce, they must remember that people will adopt new digital platforms at different speeds. Managing diversity in the workplace means carefully considering the ways people want and need to work and presenting new solutions in a way that supports that, giving people time and encouragement to transition to newer technologies. Tessa Swithenby, Director of Communications, Engagement, and Education at Computacenter, argues, A technology-centric approach is self-defeating. A people-centric approach is liberating. People understand that they are at the heart of the strategy, and so they invest their time and talents in achieving it. By focusing on people, the organisation makes it clear that the technology is there to serve them, not the other way around. While there may have traditionally existed a divide between workplace technology and everyday technology, now people are coming to expect their workplace tools to be simpler, easier, and more attractive to use. When technology is challenging and frustrating, it keeps people from being productive. While upgrading to better technology is one aspect of digital workplace transformation, its not the whole story. Its also about changing the mindset and culture of the workplaceintegrating that technology in such a way that encourages users to embrace and utilise new digital tools at their disposal. Steve Rayner, Computacenters Group Service Innovation Director asserts that its important to develop workplace solutions as if the users [your employees] have a free choice about whether they will use them or not. And they do have a choice: they could use their own [introducing the challenge of Shadow IT], or they could simply leave for an employer where they can work the way they want to. Everyone needs help learning and adopting new technology; its not about digital natives versus digital novices. The technology should be there to support the work people do so that they will want to contribute their talents and efforts to generating great ideas and making great things happen. It is in the interest of workforce diversity that companies approach digital transformation and user adoption from a people-first standpointthats how you begin to have an agile workforce. Diversity in the workforce means a broader talent base, which in turn means more productivity, efficiency, and creativity across the entire organisation. Considering the different ways people work and introducing technology in a way that supports rather than limits that will spell more success in user adoption, yielding returns for the company financially, and in a very human way.

Exhibiting under the theme of "Leading New ICT, The Road to Digital Transformation", Huawei is teaming up with industry-leading partners to showcase its latest products and solutions based on new ICT technologies such as IoT, industry cloud, All-Cloud network, and enterprise wireless. It will show how these products and solutions can be harnessed to accelerate the digital transformation of manufacturing, logistics, and energy industries. Huawei will also unveil ground-breaking cooperations with General Electric Company (GE), Intel, Toshiba and T-System. This year, Hannover MESSE has embraced the theme of "Integrated Industry – Creating Value". Traditional manufacturing is being redefined and will eventually become a fully-connected intelligent industry with connected manpower, application systems, ultimately bringing an era of networked manufacturing. Inaugural Presentation of Huawei's Flagship Manufacturing Solutions to Accelerate Digital Transformation Commenting on the digitalization of the manufacturing industry, Yan Lida, President of Huawei Enterprise Business Group, said: "Digital transformation of the manufacturing industry requires the convergence of new ICT with advanced manufacturing technologies, and more importantly, the use of these technologies throughout the design, production, management, and service phases. Using collaborative ICT such as IoT, cloud, and Big Data, Huawei teams up with partners to develop more efficient, smart, and innovative solutions for industrial digital transformation. During Hannover MESSE 2017, Huawei will launch joint innovations with industry-leading partners, such as GE, Toshiba, Intel, T-System.

Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports.

The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn’t standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there’s no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won’t be until there’s an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom.

The telecom industry’s lobbying muscle pushed a consumer privacy measure to a swift death in Congress. Republicans struck down Obama-era rules that would have imposed tight restrictions on what broadband companies. (AP) NEW YORK: Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. Early Tech Resistance The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. Calm Before The Storm The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." What Comes Next The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

However, Vietnam’s IT human resources are alarmingly lacking both in quantity and quality, as commented by deputy prime minister Vu Duc Dam. Lack of human resources “To expand production, in the first recruiting batch of 2017, we are recruiting thousands of engineers and bachelors who graduated or will graduate before December 31, 2017,” read Samsung Vietnam’s latest announcement in March 2017. Samsung currently has eight centres and factories with more than 150,000 million employees over the world.  However, they require a huge amount of manpower in order to achieve their development plan. FPT Software has brought 10,000 staff on board, raising the total number to ten per cent of the total domestic IT human resources. To carry out the growth plan during the 2017-2020 period, chairman of FPT Software Hoang Nam Tien emphasised that they target to recruit 20,000 staff to all positions of managers, programmers, bridge software engineers, comtors, and project managers.  Many of these positions will offer high salary and work abroad, such as long-term employment opportunities in Japan with salary ranging from $2.800-$3.000 a month. “We have an advantage in  digital transformation capacity and the rapid scalability of human resources of 30-40 per cent per year,” said Tien. FPT Corporation is looking to recruit nearly 50,000 personnel for the positions of student interns, managers, senior leaders in the areas of engineering, technology, and economics by 2020. The demand for IT personnel is growing rapidly in Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), Viettel, CMC, and a series of IT software companies, domestic startups, and multinational corporations operating in Vietnam, such as Samsung, LG, Intel, and IBM, to meet the demand to expand production and new orders. According to the latest report by VietnamWorks on the Vietnamese IT sector in 2017, manpower demand hit an unprecedented peak with roughly 15,000 job postings in 2016. As predicted by VietnamWorks, given that 80,000 IT employees will graduate from school in 2017-2018, Vietnam is projected to face a critical manpower shortage of 70,000 IT staff. As by 2020, the shortage will increase by 500,000 employees. According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, the total current IT manpower is over 600,000 employees. Of this number, employees working in the hardware industry make up about 300,000.  The remaining staff are working in the field of software industry and digital content creation. Vietnam is forecasted to require 1.2 million IT employees by 2020. Poor quality Not only the shortage of manpower, the quality of IT human resources is also cause for concern. At LG’s factory in Hai Phong, IT engineers working at the R&D centre have to further train and transfer in three years, workers involved in quality testing or product warranties must train from four months to a year, while assembly line workers will work after one month of training. At FPT, university graduate IT engineers are obliged to re-train for a year. To deal with training and re-training issues, Samsung has invested more than VND38 billion ($1.8 million) in supporting Vietnamese universities to develop high-quality IT human resources, while Huawei also spent more than $2 million on social programmes, mostly focusing on training and human resources development. At a recent meeting with FPT University, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam pointed out that the demand for human resources in the IT industry has increased dramatically, while the number of university and college graduates is very limited and falls far below the requirements of enterprises. An important reason pointed out by the deputy prime minister is that “the higher education environment does not meet the needs of businesses and the economy.” Nguyen Thanh Nam, vice president of FPT University, said that the IT industry is developing, changing day by day, so authorities should compile a reasonable training plan in the shortest time so that ordinary people can also participate in the fourth industrial revolution. Minister of Information and Communications Truong Minh Tuan also affirmed that he will concentrate all resources to support, train, and develop human resources specialised in electronics, telecommunications, information technology, and information security.  He said the goal is not only to focus on quantity, but also to ensure the quality of expertise and especially to have the necessary soft skills and good foreign language skills to integrate further into the global technology market. “In 2017, the Ministry will work closely with the Ministry of Education and Training to ensure the IT and telecommunication human resources training will be closely linked to market demand and technological development trends in the world. Moreover, training activities, scientific research and activities be closely linked to  needs of enterprises in the field of IT and telecommunications will,” Minister Truong Minh Tuan said.

All he wanted was for Future Barry to reveal Savitar’s identity, but what he got was something very different. Disclosure time: I fully expected to hate “The Once and Future Flash.” All season long, Barry has made things worse when he travels through time. Why would an adventure to the future be any different? We still don’t know what the long-term ramifications of his visit will be, but as things stand right now, I’d classify his trek a success. We’ll have to wait and see if his visit does more good than harm or not. Image via The CW It will be complicated, at least, because the future that Barry traveled to will likely cease to exist now that he’s been there, regardless of whether he’s able to save Iris or not. In the meantime, his presence helped bring lost souls back together again. He didn’t know it, but Barry went on a rescue mission to save Iris, but he also ended up saving the future Team Flash. In the end, this future quest was different than those before. Barry was able to get information which actually could help save Iris, unlike his vibes to the future which only provided unrelated facts about future events. Now, he has “actionable intel.” What a buzz phrase these days… In the future, Barry found a dismantled Team Flash with the team members shattered by Iris’ death (except for HR who remained his cheerful, artistic self). Barry abandoned his speedster identity, his family and team to suffer the loss of his true love alone even though he eventually trapped Savitar away. The West family was left in shambles. Joe drowned in his depression. Kid Flash was no more after a traumatizing battle with Savitar left Wally with a shattered spine. Joe was then responsible for caring for his shell of son, Wally, and continued to visit Iris’ grave without Barry by their sides. The most shocking revelation was that Caitlin turned against Team Flash in the present day as Killer Frost and partnered with Savitar. It’s unclear if she helped take Iris’ life or not, but at some point, she did destroy Cisco’s hands, eliminating his ability to vibe. But the sting was really that one of their own betrayed them, and continued to in the future. She could have helped Barry by revealing Savitar’s identity, but she was too far gone and instead taunted him. Image via The CW While it’s odd that Future Barry never figured out Savitar’s identity even though he trapped him, it may not really matter in the quest to save Iris. Barry came back with a promising lead on how to trap Savitar in 2017. He has the speed trap device Future Barry used and the name of the scientist who created it. If he can find Tracy Brand and she has the knowledge to deconstruct it, perhaps Team Flash will be able to save Iris. But Team Flash also has another team member to save as well: Caitlin. She in a dangerous predicament with her Killer Frost persona taking over her body, and it’s even worse now that she’s with Savitar. This leads back to that important question: Who is Savitar? The list of possibilities narrowed after this hour. First, it must be someone that Caitlin knows and trusts given her reaction to his reveal. Prior to this episode, Wally was a popular guess, but since he’s in a catatonic state in the future, it’s not him. My guess has been Ronnie Raymond for a while, and given Caitlin’s now-revealed connection to Savitar, it further cements that theory for me. Ronnie has a legitimate reason to be upset with Barry for his death in the singularity. And, since Ronnie was taken from Caitlin, it would be understandable if he would want to make Barry suffer by taking Iris away. “The Once and Future Flash” used time travel to show us what a future without Iris would look like, help Barry get information he can use to actually try and save Iris, and further Caitlin’s Killer Frost story. It was emotional and intense. Most importantly, it propels the story forward for the last few episodes of the season. Image via The CW The longterm ramifications of Barry’s trip could be devastating, but in the short term, he was able to accomplish more than he possibly imagined. Rating: ★★★★★ Excellent Miscellanea:  — Julian: “2017. The year it all began.” — Killer Frost: “I’m not your friend, Flash.” — Killer Frost: “I’ll never tell. You’re gonna be so surprised when you find out.” –Barry: “I wasn’t there for you?” Joe: “Why start now? I need you to leave. Please.” –Cisco really wanted Barry to stick around. Could the technology he used to keep Barry in the future be used to slow down Savitar in the past? — Future Barry: “It will break you. She’s the love of your life, Barry. She was the love of my life.” — Team Flash! — The metas, Mirror Master and Top, causing problems in the future seemed a little out of place in the hour, but it brought future Team Flash back together again, so it worked. — Cisco: “Weird, it feels just like ‘Back to the Future — which would make me Doc Brown.” — Cisco: “Hey, you know you’re my BFF, right?” Barry: “You too, man.” — Killer Frost: “What do you need me to do?” — What did you think of Future Barry’s suit?

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Asus VivoPC X compact gaming desktop now available for $799 04/24/2017 at 10:21 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments The Asus VivoPC X is a VR-ready desktop PC that’s about the size of a game console. It measures 11″ x 10.2″ x 3″ and weighs about 4.4 pounds. And under the hood, the system features a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA graphics, and support for up to 16GB of RAM and dual storage. First unveiled at CES in January, the VivoPC X is now available for purchase. You can pick one up from Newegg or Amazon for $799. Amazon is also offering a VR bundle with an Oculus Rift headset and Oculus Touch controllers for $1398, but it’s actually cheaper right now to just buy the headset + controllers separately. The VivoPC X comes with a Core i5-7300HQ processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. The system features two HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, four USB 3.1 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and has an M.2 slot for an optional solid state drive in addition to the included hard drive. It also features Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, and a headset jack. Asus says the system can support display resolutions up to 3,840 x 2160 pixels, or up to three full HD displays at once.

You know replaceable SSD, RAM, CPU, and (small) GPU. Because RyZen and Vega will make these systems cheap or redundant in the near future, so having it user serviceable is a much better option even if it means the total package is slightly larger.

"Post [Holdings] and Cardinal Health have one thing in common here: they're not getting enough credit for how they're trying to change their stripes with these acquisitions they just announced," the "Mad Money" host said. Post Holdings, the United States' third-largest cereal maker and the company behind Honey Bunches of Oats and Raisin Bran, is buying the United Kingdom's second-biggest cereal company, Weetabix, for £1.4 billion. Though the Street wrote the takeover off as being too pricey, Cramer sees the payoff ahead. Weetabix does business internationally, with operations in Asia and Africa, while Post gets 93 percent of its sales from the United States and the rest from Canada. "I think the international cross-selling opportunities could be enormous here," Cramer said, adding that the company is a smart acquirer that knows how to under-promise and over-deliver. Cardinal Health may have slashed its full-year earnings guidance, turning investors off to its future prospects, but Cramer sees upside ahead for its $6.1 billion acquisition of Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency divisions. "What really matters is that these Medtronic assets will help Cardinal Health continue to diversify itself away from that lousy drug wholesaling business that caused the darned shortfall in the first place, and they'll give the company's medical supplies segment a much needed shot in the arm," Cramer said. Furthermore, Cardinal's disappointing guidance could give the company just enough weakness to spring from, as it expects this deal to boost earnings by 55 cents in 2019. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pedestrian passes the bull statue in the Financial District near the New York Stock Exchange in New York. As the bull market surges higher and earnings reports continue to top expectations, Cramer turned to technician Mark Sebastian's charts to find out whether the upward move is at all sustainable. Being an expert on the CBOE Volatility Index — VIX for short — Sebastian compared the near term volatility tracker to the S&P 500 to show the strength of the market's trajectory. When centrist Emmanuel Macron came in first place in France's first-round elections Sunday, the S&P took off, rallying 1.6 percent since Friday's close. But the VIX saw an even bigger drop, cratering at the unusually low level of 10.5. "Looking at this moment through the prism of the big rally we got last November when the VIX plummeted, Sebastian thinks this is showing that we have got a lot more room to run," Cramer said. "Based on the action in the VIX, he easily sees the S&P traveling to 2,450 before it runs out of steam." Siegfried Layda | Getty Images Cramer is always up for analyzing the stock market's valuation when commentary suggests that it has run too far too quickly and is too expensive. So the "Mad Money" host decided to compare the leading stocks' future price-to-earnings multiples from 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, to now to see whether there is any weight to the argument that today's market is too pricey. In 2000, tech giants were already running the show. Microsoft traded at 59 times earnings, Cisco at 179 times earnings, Intel at 126 times earnings and Oracle at 87 times earnings. Now, Microsoft trades at 20 times earnings, Cisco at 13 times earnings, Intel at 17 times earnings, and Oracle at 16 times earnings. "When you consider that the average stock in the S&P 500 sells for 21 times earnings, not only are these four tech stocks ridiculously undervalued versus their prices back then, they're actually cheaper than the average stock in the S&P right now," Cramer said. Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images A worker passes a bag of food to a customer at the drive-thru window at a McDonald's fast food restaurant in White House, Tennessee. Then, after Dow components Caterpillar, DuPont, and McDonald's surprised the Street with huge earnings gains, Cramer looked into the companies to see if their wins were real or one-offs. The market has grown used to what Cramer calls "manufactured earnings beats," or reports that come in a penny better than expected because of share buybacks or other corporate tricks. But not these companies. All three outshone expectations via execution of smart tactics that seemed out of reach several years ago, the "Mad Money" host said. Finally, Cramer spoke with Briggs & Stratton Chairman, President and CEO Todd Teske on Tuesday to gauge the company's future in light of the manufacturing stock's massive jump. Teske attributed the engine maker's success to its push into the commercial market as well as increasing sales, but said he was concerned with the United States' growing skills gap. The gap is extended by companies like Briggs & Stratton that rely on robots for a bulk portion of their manufacturing and thus require high-skilled laborers to maintain operations. "I and other manufacturing CEOs have been out there talking a lot about the fact that we need people who can run robots, program robots, CNC equipment, robotic welding and things like that," the CEO said. "It's a big issue." And while the manufacturer has training programs in place for new workers, Teske said that more should be done on a nationwide scale if the federal government tightens visa laws. "I think there's more that we need to do as a country because the skills gap is only going to get worse, especially as more jobs come back here to the U.S. if, in fact, some of the administration['s] policies start to take hold," Teske told Cramer. In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Magna International Inc.: "Well, you don't want to buy it for [a rumor it will work with Apple on self-driving cars] no matter what, because that's way too far in advance and if you do want autonomous driving, you know I believe in Waymo, which is Google, which is Alphabet, which is owned by my charitable trust. I think Magna is too cheap to sell, but it is related to autos and everything related to autos is stalled. But I am not going to tell you to sell it. I just can't count on buying it right here." Sprint Corp.: "Last night we had [T-Mobile CEO] John Legere on and he was lobbing his usual bombs and throwing the claymore mines around and doing the bazookas, and all I can tell you is that he had good things to say about Sprint. And in the conference call, he even talked about looking, you know, trying to figure out what to do with them, maybe Dish. I want to own Sprint." Questions for Cramer?

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD slips up as leak indicates its Vega GPUs are… AMD slips up as leak indicates its Vega GPUs are coming ‘this quarter’ By Mark Coppock — April 25, 2017 10:06 AM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been waiting to build a new gaming PC around AMD's Vega GPU architecture, then you're wait might be coming to a close. AMD has made some waves lately with its new Zen architecture and Ryzen processors, offering a line of CPUs with competitive performance to Intel’s Core processors and even more competitive pricing. Now, AMD fans are waiting for the company to make its next move by introducing its next generation Vega GPUs. Until now, AMD hasn’t provided any information on when Vega might be officially introduced, leaving gamers waiting impatiently for stronger competition with Nvidia’s Pascal architecture. Today, however, it looks like AMD might have let the cat out of the bag, with its AMD Poland Facebook page indicating that Vega will arrive this quarter, as Wccftech.com reports. Of course, it’s entirely possible that someone at AMD Poland spoke out of turn, and so this information should be considered unverified at this point. But there’s other information that seems to confirm an imminent release, such as a Vega GPU showing in CompuBench benchmark results — something that usually happens shortly before a new component is released. In addition, AMD has now provided Vega OpenGL support for Linux, and the company has apparently devoted 80 percent of its driver engineers to Vega optimization for the past few months. Simply put, while nobody knows when Vega will arrive, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that it’s going to show up in gaming PCs sooner rather than later. By the CompuBench results, Vega will offer at least competitive performance compared to the Nvidia GTX 1080 but significantly lower than the GTX 1080 Ti. Without knowing where in the Vega line the tested GPU is positioned, we don’t know if that’s low-end, midrange, or high-end Vega performance. Nevertheless, AMD fans should have some tantalizing options to choose from. AMD 687F:C1 GTX 1080 Ti Catmull-Clark Subdivision Level 3: 81.251 mTriangles/s 245.95 mTriangles/s Catmull-Clark Subdivision Level 5: 239.511 mTriangles/s 353.415 mTriangles/s Subsurface Scattering multiple view: 6,262.991 mSamples/s 9,610.488 mSamples/s TV-L1 Optical Flow: 56.729 mPixels/s 64.918 mPixels/s Level Set Segmentation – 128: 10,281.757 mVoxels/s N/A Level Set Segmentation – 256: 10,844.834 mVoxels/s N/A AMD recently released a new Radeon RX 500 Series of GPUs based on its current Polaris generation, and so anyone who wants decent AMD gaming performance without spending serious money has that option to consider. But otherwise, it’s looking like anyone planning on a truly high-end gaming experience won’t have too long to wait before they’ll be able to look outside of Nvidia’s lineup when choosing their next GPU.

Call of Duty: WW2 will be sold at stores, and some of the people working at those stores are so excited they’ve broken whatever NDAs they’re under to share images of newly-received marketing materials. The latest Call of Duty: WW2 retail leak, shared on Twitter by BERNiE HiGHROLLER‏ and passed on via Charlie Intel, shows off the Pro Edition, which is exclusive to GameStop in the US. According to this source, Call of Duty: WW2 Pro Edition comes with a collectible steelbook and the inevitable season pass, and “additional bonus content”, which usually means skins or multiplayer goodies. The images also make mention of a Call of Duty: WW2 PS4 beta, which is no surprise given how much Sony and Activision want to have each other’s babies, Oh, and pre-orders include an exclusive Call of Duty: WWW2 hat. Like, a real world hat, not an in-game hat. I don’t think they wore snapbacks during WW2. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: WW2 will be revealed at 10:00am PT/1:00pm ET/6:00pm UK April 26, so we don’t have long to wait before all this information will (probably) be freely available on retailer sites. An earlier retail leak dropped some details on Call of Duty: WW2’s campaign and standalone co-op story mode, and Activision itself accidentally leaked Call of Duty WW2 screenshots through the franchise website. Call of Duty: WW2 is expected to release on PC, PS4 and Xbox One on November 3. As usual, it will almost certainly be one of the biggest entertainment releases of the year, making every other game and most books, albums and movies look like small beans indeed. It’s no wonder Activision can’t keep a lid on it, hey.

Google parent Alphabet will provide an update that day. The search and ad giant has been in the news recently over concerns about ads appearing on inappropriate YouTube content. Amazon will also report, and we'll be looking to see if the firm can continue to push gross margins higher. Third, we have Microsoft, which has been on a roll recently, with the cloud growing quickly and legacy businesses holding their own. Intel is also due. We're expecting modest growth for the year as data center growth is offset by declines in PC sales. There are plenty of consumer firms reporting, too, including Chipotle, Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Starbucks, and Procter & Gamble. We'll get a sense of the industrial economy from Alcoa, 3M, Boeing, Ford, and GM. In healthcare, Express Scripts, Eli Lilly, and Amgen will report. And finally, oil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are due Friday. The first reading of first-quarter GDP will be released Friday, and director of economic analysis Bob Johnson is expecting an anemic start to 2017. Other data includes consumer sentiment gauges, housing metrics, and durable goods orders. Stay tuned to Morningstar for our take on these stories.

But that’s set to change in the next 12 to 18 months, so let’s look at what could drive M&A deals going forward. Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and deals database tracked $1.5 billion investments in the last 12 months to Q1 2017, and found only $600 million of M&As in the same period. That dynamic of investments outstripping M&As is typical of early-stage tech markets, when deal making is all about investment for growth rather than consolidation for dominance or cost. However, as the VR/AR market continues to scale, M&A deal flow is on the rise. Major corporations are actively honing their strategies on where and who to buy. Startups are also considering larger corporate parents to provide safe harbor, until the market is big enough for their business models to sing. And as often happens, early-stage companies that can’t raise the next round are looking for mergers with better funded startups to leverage their tech and talent. *Also Read:* How Virtual Reality Industry Hopes to Take Tech Mainstream *It’s good to be the king* VR’s apex predators are Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive. But apex predators are giant, toothsome beasts that need to eat. A lot. High-end PC VR is compelling. However, buying the headset, controllers, PC, graphics card and premium software to make it fun put it beyond the reach of mass-market consumers. So while there are hundreds of thousands of Oculus and Vive users today, Digi-Capital’s forecasts see console/PC VR’s combined installed base only topping 20 million units by the end of the decade (Note: this is installed base, not annual unit sales, and excludes higher volume mobile VR). And this is for companies used to operating in markets with users counted in the billions. Facebook’s enterprise value is close to $400 billion, it paid $3 billion for Oculus, and Mark Zuckerberg might invest $3 billion more on top of that. Facebook could fund Oculus’ PC division indefinitely, and HTC also has a large cash stockpile (although perhaps not quite such a big one) to fund the Vive division. With two T-Rex’s and not enough food, something’s got to give at the high end. It’s not clear what deal (if any) might result, but watch this space. *Also Read:* Oculus Co-Founder Palmer Luckey Exits Facebook *Picks and shovels* While it’s not surprising to see corporates buying component makers and solution providers to accelerate internal development, VR/AR’s roster of buyers has been impressive for such an early stage market. Microsoft bought ODG’s patents for up to a reported $150 million. Apple bought Metaio. Google, Facebook, Intel and Snapchat each bought multiple component makers and solution providers. For core technology startups around mobile AR and AR smartglasses in particular, the high level of interest from corporate acquirers looks set to deliver more deals this year. *Consolidation blues* Some VR/AR sectors have become crowded already, with hundreds of startups chasing the same early stage consumers (and their wallets). The two sectors with lowest barriers to entry and the highest number of startups are VR video and VR games. While some of the best-funded companies have the resources to see them through, others are already facing the financial realities of this stage of the market. Expect to see consolidation in these sectors in 2017, with a spurt of investment and growth coalescing around mobile AR in the wake of Facebook’s AR Platform launch at F8. *Also Read:* Virtual Reality Firm Upload to Open LA Headquarters in April (Exclusive) *Through the looking glass* Nobody has come close to an Oculus-size deal in AR, with the largest full-stack AR acquisition being Intel buying Recon for $175 million. AR smartglasses could take a few years to conquer AR’s five consumer challenges (hero device, all day battery life, cellular connectivity, app ecosystem, telco cross-subsidization). Meanwhile, mobile AR could become the dominant form of consumer AR through a combination of Facebook’s AR platform and whatever Apple and Samsung introduce, if and when they enter the market. Given some folks’ wait-and-see approach to what the Facebook/Oculus deal means, AR’s consumer market might need to become more established before corporates leap to the first billion-dollar AR acquisition. *Everything else* VR/AR advertising, peripherals, distribution, social, enterprise and location-based VR have the benefit of not being overcrowded, but they also don’t have a catalyst to kick off M&A in a major way yet. For large scale deal activity here, the total VR/AR installed base needs to scale to where corporates can’t stay on the sidelines any longer, and also need specific skills and tech they can’t develop in-house. *Also Read:* Virtual and Augmented Reality Investment Hit Record $2.3 Billion in 2016 (Guest Blog) *Where do we go from here?* As VR/AR goes through a hinge year between last year’s launch and the coming inflection point around mobile AR, deal makers are being forced to consider where and when to move. Buy too early and risk being accused of irrational exuberance, buy too late and risk missing the boat. As always with VR/AR, it’s all a question of vision. All the investments and M&As in VR/AR for the last 5 years are tracked in detail in Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and bundled deals database. *Related stories from TheWrap:* How Virtual Reality Industry Hopes to Take Tech Mainstream Virtual Reality Firm Upload to Open LA Headquarters in April (Exclusive) Virtual and Augmented Reality Investment Hit Record $2.3 Billion in 2016 (Guest Blog) » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 1 week ago< > Embed ​Facebook Brings Augmented Reality to Your Phone - CNET 00:40 Later this year, Facebook will begin releasing technology that will let you and your child turn your doctor's waiting room table into a battlefield for a tower defense video game only you two can see.

The winners were announced Tuesday. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press; Lauren O'Neil/CBC; Marion Curtis/Associated Press) Related Stories Webby Awards: CBC's Missing & Murdered podcast, NFB's Seances vie for online prize Lady Gaga, Pokemon Go and Steve Buscemi are among the winners of this year's Webby Awards. The annual honour, now in its 21st year, celebrates the best of the internet and web culture. Gaga won a pair of Webbys for her high-tech tribute to David Bowie at last year's Grammys, which was produced in partnership with Intel. Pokemon Go was picked as best game and won two other awards after becoming a smartphone sensation last summer. And Steve Buscemi snagged the prize for best actor, thanks to his performance in Louis C.K.'s web series Horace and Pete.   In total, there are 407 Webby winners this year, with prizes in the special achievement, web, online film and video, advertising and media, mobile sites and apps, social and podcasts and digital audio categories. On top of that, there's two winners in most of these categories: recipient of the Webby Award (chosen by the academy) and the Webby's People's Choice Award (chosen by public voting). Some of the nominees snagged both prizes. A few nominees with Canadian connections were named winners: the people's choice Webby for game or application in advertising and media was given to Absolut Deadmau5, a VR storytelling adventure featuring the hit Canadian DJ. And for the best use of data driven media award within the advertising and media category, projects with Canadian ties won both the Webby and the people's choice awards. Publicis New York was given the Webby for their "I'm Moving to Canada" campaign for Doctors of the World. It took the sky-high search results of people looking to move to Canada during the U.S. election and turned them into donations for Syrian medical aid.  FCB Toronto and the Canadian Down Syndrome Society won people's choice for their Down Syndrome Answers video series, which featured people with Down Syndrome answering and offering insight into the 40 most common questions asked about the condition.   The CBC podcast Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams​ was nominated for best documentary in the podcasts and digital audio category, but didn't end up winning. The awards will be handed out in New York during a ceremony next month hosted by Joel McHale. And of course, organizers will be strictly enforcing the prize's trademark five-word acceptance speeches. Here are a handful of some other notable winners, who will be feted in May: Artist of the year: Solange ​Best actress: Gillian Anderson, The Fall Social movement of the year: Women's March Best writing (editorial), web: The New Yorker (Webby winner and people's choice) Comedy: long form or series, online film and video: Jimmy Kimmel Live's mean tweets series With files from the Associated Press Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines 'We've had 700 calls on this': Landowners left hanging by gas company's demise video Pope Francis decries 'culture of waste' in surprise TED Talk Pass the butter: Cutting saturated fat does not reduce heart disease risk, cardiologists say Blue Jays' Coghlan flies over catcher to help Toronto beat St. Louis read comments U.S. says softwood lumber imports don't play by rules, but Canada replies: See you in court read comments video Latest Entertainment News Headlines Bachelor star Chris Soules jailed after deadly Iowa crash Best year he's ever had? 2016 was the year of Drake, according to stats Night Trap, controversial horror game from the '90s, set for a re-release Scott Baio explains 'if you do drugs or drink, you're going to die' remarks after Erin Moran's death 'Has it affected him?'

SolidRun, which is known for its NXP i.MX6 based HummingBoard SBCs and Marvell Armada 38x based ClearFog Pro and scaled down ClearFog Base networking boards, has spun a $349 (and up) Marvell MacchiatoBIN SBC that showcases Marvell’s high-end Armada 8040 SoC. The 170 x 170mm “community” Mini-ITX board ships with schematics and layout files, and offers an open source, mainline Linux 4.4x BSP. Marvell MacchiatoBIN from two angles (click images to enlarge) The Marvell MacchiatoBIN is notable for combining a relatively low price with support for high-end networking features like OpenDataPlane (ODP), OpenFastPath (OFP) and ARM network functions virtualization (NFV). Linaro’s ODP, which was announced back in 2013, is an open source data plane API that enables Linux software portability between networking SoCs, regardless of the underlying chip architecture. OpenFastPath is an open source implementation of a high performance TCP/IP stack. ARM NFV — ARM’s fairly recent answer to Intel’s NFV — is designed to work with ODP to enable virtual network function (VNF) applications, such as deploying virtual set-top boxes. The MacchiatoBIN’s Linux BSP is said to be optimized for ODP. The BSP includes U-Boot 2015.x, mainline U-Boot, UEFI EDK2, Linux LTS kernel 4.4.x, mainline Linux, Yocto 2.1, SUSE Linux, and netmap. Marvell MacchiatoBIN front panel view (click image to enlarge) Marvell’s Armada 8040 (88F8040) supplies far more networking support and overall firepower than the single- or dual-Cortex-A9 Armada 38x found on the 38x-MicroSOM computer-on-module that drives the ClearFog boards. Marvell also offers a similar dual-core sibling called the Armada 8020. Marvel Armada 8040 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Unlike the ClearFog and HummingBoard SBCs, the MacchiatoBIN does not house the SoC on a separate COM. The Armada 8040 is hidden under a heatsink needed to dissipate the heat from four Cortex-A72 cores that can run at up to 2GHz. There’s no GPU on this headless SoC, but you get networking acceleration, including a packet processor with a security co-processor, and DMA and XOR (RAID 5/6 acceleration) engines. MacchiatoBIN simplified block diagram (left) and detail view (click images to enlarge) The Armada 8040 also implements Marvell’s Modular Chip (MoChi) architecture and associated MoChi interconnect (MCI), which “enables driver-transparent expansion beyond the standard device offering.” MCI is said to support the MacchiatoBIN’s dual 10GbE and single 2.5GbE and 1GbE Ethernet ports, as well as the 4x PCIe 3.0, USB 3.0, 3x SATA 3.0, and microSD 3.0 interfaces. The SoC’s MoChI/MCI functionality is expressed via a USB-C port, and “is essentially transparent to the driver,” says Marvell. All the connected MCI interfaces appear to drivers as though they were integrated functions of the SoC itself, enabling a Virtual System-on-Chip (vSoC) implementation, says the chip designer. The Marvell MacchiatoBIN ships with 4GB or 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and offers unspecified, possibly optional amounts of SPI and eMMC flash. The microSD slot is available with an optional, empty 8GB card. In addition to the I/O listed farther above, you get USB 2.0 and UART headers, a JTAG interface, and a Marvell TDM low-speed module expansion header. The TDM header includes SPI, I2C, TDM, and power interfaces. A Mini-ITX case is standard, and power supplies for the 12V input are optional. Other community-backed networking boards include the Banana Pi BPI-R2 router board and Turris Omnia router board. Neither has 10GbE or 2.5GbE ports, however. Specifications listed for the Marvell MacchiatoBIN include: Processor — Marvell Armada 8040 (4x Cortex-A72 cores @ up to 2GHz); packet, security, DMA, and XOR co-processors Memory/storage: 4GB to 16GB of single-channel DDR4 RAM with optional ECC and single/dual chip select support SPI and eMMC flash (unspecified, possibly optional) MicroSD slot with optional 8GB card 3x SATA 3.0 connectors Networking: 2x 10GbE ports via copper or SFP 2.5GbE port via SFP 1GbE (Gigabit Ethernet) port via copper Other I/O: USB 3.0 port Micro-USB port with UART console support and converter cable USB 2.0 headers USB-C port with MoChi MCI interface 2x UARTs Reset and fan headers Boot and frequency selectors 20-pin CPU JTAG debugger Expansion — 4x PCIe 3.0 slots; Marvell TDM low-speed module expansion header Other features — Reset button; 3x heatsinks (1x CPU, 2x Ethernet); Mini-ITX case Power — 12V DC input and adapter with ATX connector; optional 12V (110/220V) or ATX power supplies Dimensions — 170 x 170mm (Mini-ITX) Operating system — Linux BSP with U-Boot 2015.x, mainline U-Boot, UEFI EDK2, Linux LTS kernel 4.4.x, mainline Linux, Yocto 2.1, SUSE Linux, and netmap/DPDK   Further information SolidRun’s Marvell MacchiatoBIN starts at $349 with 4GB RAM, or $498 with 16GB. An FCC waiver is required for U.S. import.

Twitter Facebook Huawei, Google supercharge Android with new Raspberry Pi-like board The HiKey 960 will be the go-to computer board for Android and will sell for US$239 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 26 April, 2017 08:00 - - - - print email Comments Prepare to run Android at blazing fast speeds on a new Raspberry Pi-like computer developed by Huawei. Huawei's HiKey 960 computer board is priced at US$239 but has some of the latest CPU and GPU technologies. Google, ARM, Huawei, Archermind, and LeMaker all played roles in developing the board. The HiKey 960 is meant to be a go-to PC for Android or a tool to develop software and drivers for the OS. The board development was backed by Linaro, an organization that develops software packages for the Android OS and ARM architecture. Linaro CEO George Grey recently said it was sad that Android developers had to write code on x86 chips. He encouraged the organization's members to build a superfast computer so developers could build ARM software on ARM architecture. Intel has scaled back Android support on x86 PCs and isn't making smartphone chips. The HiKey 960 can be used to create robots, drones, and other smart devices. But it's mainly intended to be an Android PC or a tool for developers who want to write and test applications. The board can deliver performance similar to the latest smartphone and tablets. It has a Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core chip, which has four high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 and four low-power Cortex-A53 cores. The Kirin 960 is also used in the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone, which started shipping late last year. The HiKey 960 has 32GB of storage and 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The Mali-G71 GPU is capable of delivering 4K graphics and is based on ARM's latest Bitfrost architecture. However, the board will only have HDMI 1.2a slot, which is a 1080p display output. Other features include dual-band 802.11 b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. The board has a PCIe m.2 slot to add additional storage or wireless capabilities. It also has 40-pin and 60-pin expansion connectors and multiple high-definition outputs so cameras can be connected to the board. It will ship in the U.S., European Union, and Japan in early May. It will later ship worldwide. The board will also support multiple Linux versions in the future. You can load Android 7.1 on the board, but you will need to be technically savvy and have knowledge of command-line operations. Instructions to load Android 7.1 are on Google's website. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Huawei, Google supercharge Android with new Raspberry Pi-like board The HiKey 960 will be the go-to computer board for Android and will sell for US$239 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 26 April, 2017 08:00 0 - - - - print email Prepare to run Android at blazing fast speeds on a new Raspberry Pi-like computer developed by Huawei. Huawei's HiKey 960 computer board is priced at US$239 but has some of the latest CPU and GPU technologies. Google, ARM, Huawei, Archermind, and LeMaker all played roles in developing the board. The HiKey 960 is meant to be a go-to PC for Android or a tool to develop software and drivers for the OS. The board development was backed by Linaro, an organization that develops software packages for the Android OS and ARM architecture. Linaro CEO George Grey recently said it was sad that Android developers had to write code on x86 chips. He encouraged the organization's members to build a superfast computer so developers could build ARM software on ARM architecture. Intel has scaled back Android support on x86 PCs and isn't making smartphone chips. The HiKey 960 can be used to create robots, drones, and other smart devices. But it's mainly intended to be an Android PC or a tool for developers who want to write and test applications. The board can deliver performance similar to the latest smartphone and tablets. It has a Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core chip, which has four high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 and four low-power Cortex-A53 cores. The Kirin 960 is also used in the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone, which started shipping late last year. The HiKey 960 has 32GB of storage and 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The Mali-G71 GPU is capable of delivering 4K graphics and is based on ARM's latest Bitfrost architecture. However, the board will only have HDMI 1.2a slot, which is a 1080p display output. Other features include dual-band 802.11 b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. The board has a PCIe m.2 slot to add additional storage or wireless capabilities. It also has 40-pin and 60-pin expansion connectors and multiple high-definition outputs so cameras can be connected to the board. It will ship in the U.S., European Union, and Japan in early May. It will later ship worldwide. The board will also support multiple Linux versions in the future. You can load Android 7.1 on the board, but you will need to be technically savvy and have knowledge of command-line operations. Instructions to load Android 7.1 are on Google's website.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Apr 25 - 5:47 AM Comcast wants to replace old boxes, but there's a catch Apr 24 - 5:10 PM Andrew Harnik / AP President Trump gives an interview to the Associated Press on his first 100 days in office. by Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, and Lori Robertson, FactCheck.org Close icon Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley, and Lori Robertson FactCheck.org In an interview with the Associated Press, President Trump put some spin on what he has done — and hasn’t done — as he nears the completion of his first 100 days in office: Related Coverage Trump seeks 15 percent corporate tax rate, even if it swells the national debt Trump touts executive orders he once lambasted Hardball health care option may cost Trump and taxpayers • Trump said he has not labeled China a currency manipulator, as promised, because it hasn’t manipulated its currency since he took office out of respect for him. The Chinese president “knew I would do something,” Trump said. In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014. • The president also said that the wall he wants to build on the Mexico border will cost “$10 billion or less,” but cost estimates by his own Department of Homeland Security and two independent organizations say it could cost at least twice that much. The president also repeated several false and misleading claims, including taking too much credit for job creation. Analysis The Associated Press interviewed Trump in the Oval Office on April 21, and published a transcript of the interview on April 24. The interview comes as the president nears completion of his first 100 days in office — which will occur on April 29 — and dealt in part with the promises he made during the campaign. China’s currency During the campaign, Trump issued a “100-day action plan to Make America Great Again.” One of those promises dealt with China’s history of devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage. In his action plan, Trump said on his first day in office he would “direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.” That has not happened. In fact, the Treasury Department issued a report on April 14 that declined to label China a currency manipulator. The president told the Associated Press that “things change” and he needs “flexibility” once he takes office. He said the decision was in part political, as he is trying to convince China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. But then he twisted the facts about China’s history of devaluing its currency. Trump said he decided not to label China a currency manipulator, in part, because it has not manipulated its currency since he took office. Trump claimed credit for that, saying “there’s a certain respect” that China’s President Xi Jinping has for him and “he knew I would do something” if China devalued its currency. In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014, years before Trump took office. Trump, April 21: But [Chinese] President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there’s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he’s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, “By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you’re a currency manipulator.” It doesn’t work that way. … And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don’t get it, in which case they’re very stupid people, or they just don’t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, “He didn’t call them a currency manipulator.” Well, for two reasons. Number One, he’s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it’s like generalities, it’s not. They have — they’ve actually — their currency’s gone up. So it’s a very, very specific formula. And I said, “How badly have they been,” … they said, “Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.” That’s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. As the Washington Post explained, “The value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency manipulation occurs when a country buys or sell [sic] large amounts of its own currency on global markets to change the price. But U.S. policy is really directed at countries that sell large volumes of their own currency to lower its price — a practice that makes a country’s exports relatively cheap on global markets, hurting American exporters. In previous years, when China artificially lowered the value of its currency, it helped the country export products to the United States, and U.S. industries and workers balked at what they saw as an unfair competitive edge.” The Treasury report found that “after engaging in one-way, large-scale intervention to resist appreciation of the RMB [the Chinese currency] for a decade, China’s recent intervention in foreign exchange markets has sought to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have negative consequences for the United States, China, and the global economy.” Moreover, the report notes that China’s “lack of intervention to resist appreciation” has been occurring “over the last three years.” In other words, China didn’t make a change in its policy since Trump took office, or because — as Trump said — of a perceived threat that Trump would “do something.” Economists broadly agree that China has not been holding down its currency since 2014 or 2015. “The accusation that China is manipulating its currency in order to gain an unfair advantage for its exports is not supported by economic facts,” Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and formerly head of the IMF’s China Division, told us in an email. “Since mid-2014, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC, China’s central bank) has in fact been intervening in currency markets to prevent the renminbi (RMB) from falling too sharply in value against the dollar. Over the past three years, China has burnt up $1 trillion of its stock of foreign exchange reserves in order to support its currency and prevent it from depreciating as much and as fast as market forces seem to want.” “Thus, China has, if anything, been doing the U.S. a favor by not letting the RMB depreciate as much and as fast against the dollar as indicated by market pressures,” Prasad said. “The reason it has done this is largely to forestall any domestic financial instability from panic-driven capital outflows if it were to allow the RMB to depreciate a lot, especially over a short period.” Brad Setser, a senior fellow and acting director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said conventional wisdom is that China shifted from buying reserves to selling reserves several years ago. “If by manipulation, you mean – when did China stop accumulating reserves to hold its currency down, it stopped manipulating in 2014 or 2015,” Setser told us via email. But Setser said the issue is made more complex, “because China has held its currency relatively stable against the dollar this year, and that is arguably a change (though holding the currency stable against the dollar has been relatively easy for China because the dollar has been relatively stable or even weakened a bit against the other big currencies).” Some consider manipulation to mean any government intervention in the market at all, not just depreciating currency, Setser said. But it is clear from Trump’s statements that he was concerned about China holding down its currency to gain a trade advantage, to the detriment especially of U.S. manufacturers. Economists say that’s exactly what China was doing for more than a decade, but as Eduardo Porter put it for the New York Times, “Trump Isn’t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late.” Trump said his decision to not label China a currency manipulator was partly political, since he is trying to convince China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. We take no position on that. But Trump’s claim that China stopped manipulating its currency when he took office — and more, that it did so “because there’s a certain respect, because [Xi] knew I would do something or whatever” — is another example of Trump taking credit for something that long predates his presidency. Spinning the border wall costs During the campaign, Trump also promised to build a “big, fat beautiful wall” along the southern border. In his 100-day action plan, Trump said he would work with Congress to fully fund the wall “with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.” The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as we will explain later, has moved forward with the project, so that promise is a work in progress. But in the AP interview, Trump lowballed the estimated cost of the project, claiming it will cost “$10 billion or less.” Trump, April 21: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I’m seeing. I’m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive. Associated Press: What do you think the estimate on it would be? Trump: Oh I’m seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. … The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It’s not going to cost anywhere near that. Associated Press: You think $10 billion or less. Trump: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it’s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. We can’t predict the future, but the estimates to date have been much higher than $10 billion: • According to an internal document obtained by Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security estimated the cost could be as much as $21.6 billion. • Bernstein Research, an investment-management and research firm, has estimated that the cost of the project is “widely expected to be greater than $15 billion and perhaps as much as $25 billion.” • MIT Technology Review, a magazine published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated in October that a 1,000-mile wall could cost between $27 billion and $40 billion. The cost of the wall will depend on many factors — such as the height and length of the wall, the construction materials used, and whether parts of the wall are substituted with fencing or other barriers. Let’s take a look at what the Trump administration envisions and how much it might cost. On March 17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals “to acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.” One RFP is for a “solid concrete border wall,” and the second RFP is for “other border wall.” For the “other border wall,” the RPF says: “Prototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).” So, we know that the administration is at least considering not just a solid concrete wall, but a combination of walls and other barriers. The wall — whether solid concrete or an alternative design — must be between 18 feet and 30 feet tall and 2 feet wide, according to the RFPs. It also must go 6 feet below the ground to prevent people from tunneling under the wall. As for the length of the wall, the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,933 miles. But the DHS document obtained by Reuters indicated that the administration will not seek to build new barriers the full length of the border. “The plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020,” Reuters wrote on Feb. 9. “With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.” The 654 miles of existing barriers is a reference, as we have written before, to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology. In its report, Bernstein Research wrote that under the 2006 law “18ft tall steel ‘primary fencing’ is used in many urban areas … to less substantial ‘vehicle fencing’ in lower-risk areas.” The cost of the primary fencing, also known as pedestrian fencing, averaged about $6.5 million per mile under the 2006 law, according to a September 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office. At that per-mile average price (not adjusted for inflation), a 1,250-mile “wall” constructed entirely of pedestrian fencing would cost more than $8 billion. More recently, Trump’s chief budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told talk show host Hugh Hewitt in March that the per-mile cost “starts at $8 million per mile” and “goes up to about $25 million per mile.” The range of Mulvaney’s per-mile cost estimates would place the total cost at between $10 billion and $31.25 billion for 1,250 miles of walls and fences. Mulvaney added that the total cost “just depends on … what you decide to build in what areas.” As we said, Homeland Security estimated that the 1,250-mile combination of fences and walls under the Trump administration plan could cost as much as $21.6 billion. Bernstein Research estimated the cost at between $15 billion and $25 billion. The firm — which provided its estimate during the campaign, when Trump gave no details on the size and scope of the project — assumed construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall at 40 feet tall and 7 feet deep, but only 10 inches thick. MIT Technology Review provided its cost estimate in October. The magazine’s cost estimate of between $27 billion and $40 billion assumes construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall that is 50 feet tall and 10 feet underground — which is taller and deeper than the specifications ordered by DHS, but not as long. We don’t know what the wall will cost, but independent analyses and Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security say a border wall could cost twice as much as Trump’s figure. Job creation and other repeats In his interview, Trump also repeated claims we have fact-checked before — most of them dealing with his campaign promise to be “the greatest jobs president God has ever created.” Trump once again claimed too much credit for job creation, saying, “we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.” As we wrote two weeks ago, under Trump, the U.S. job growth has been 317,000 jobs in February and March. That’s according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The January job numbers — an additional 216,000 jobs — were based on a survey that was done before Trump was inaugurated. This job growth is a continuation of a trend that began pre-Trump: The economy added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of the 96 months under President Obama, and as of March, the U.S. has had 77 straight months of job growth. The president also cited examples of his job creation, and in some cases he took too much credit. Trump: As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma [chairman of Alibaba Group], he comes up, he says, “Only because of you am I making this massive investment.” Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that. But, as we’ve written before, investments made by Ford and GM were part of longtime trends and market decisions. Ford CEO Mark Fields, for example, praised Trump’s promises to cut taxes and regulation, but said recent investments in U.S. plants were market-based. Asked on Fox Business News if he would have made the investments had Trump not won the election, Fields said, “Yes, absolutely.” As for Intel, we wrote in February that Trump had a stronger case in that instance. The Intel CEO credited Trump’s pro-business policies for a $7 billion investment in an Arizona factory, though Intel had announced a $5 billion investment in that facility in 2011. The project wasn’t completed. “We’re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,” Intel spokesman William Moss said. “That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro business and pro investment goals.” And Jack Ma, of Alibaba, the e-commerce Chinese company, told Trump in early January that he would add 1 million U.S. small businesses to the online platform over the next five years, a move Alibaba said could add 1 million jobs (one each per small business). Trump also again took credit for saving hundreds of millions on the F-35 jet made by Lockheed Martin, savings that were in the works before he was sworn in. “[A] little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget,” he said, going on to say that he called Lockheed and said he would have to “bid this out to another company, namely Boeing” and that “I started getting competing offers back and forth.” Trump claimed he saved $725 million. In the past, he has claimed a savings of $600 million. But as the Washington Post‘s Fact Checker found, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, had already announced on Dec. 19 — before Trump met privately with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson — that the cost of the F-35 would come down. His cost reduction estimate came out to $549 million to $630 million, according to the Post’s calculation. Aviation Week also wrote that Trump “overstates” his role and that the price reduction on the jet had been “ongoing.” In addition, the president rehashed a campaign claim that distorts the facts on the vetting process required for those entering the U.S. Trump: We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. Trump didn’t specify that he was talking about refugees, but he indicated he was speaking about his “stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.” Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made similar claims. For instance, in a late August speech on illegal immigration, he said that Syrian refugees seeking admission to the U.S. have “no documentation” and “no paperwork.” That’s false. As we wrote, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Congress in October 2015 that “we’ve found with Syrian refugees … in general they have many, many documents.” Documents were also one part of the vetting process, she said. Those applying for refugee status are also interviewed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and go through security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. There’s a health screening and a three-day “cultural orientation,” too.

Transform’s enterprise SaaS platform is the only all-in-one big data analytics platform designed specifically for enterprise revenue acceleration. It features a self-constructing data engine that ingests and models specific threads of data from a customer’s internal information systems, online ad systems, and third-party data services. The platform’s role-based machine learning BOTS provide insights, predictions and recommendations specific to users with job functions across the overall sales and marketing organization. As a result, Transform’s RDP delivers a 10x reduction in the time and cost of legacy enterprise business intelligence implementations and enables businesses to optimize their sales, marketing, advertising, channels, promotions and incentives.  „We believe that businesses should be getting a lot more from the massive investments they make in sales and marketing — more sustainable and predictable revenue growth. And we believe that data is the key. So, we’re changing the game for enterprise business intelligence, proving it doesn’t have to take years and cost millions of dollars,” Transform’s co-founder and CEO, Tom Chiarella said. „Furthermore, we believe that our customers require actions, not simply charts and graphs geared for a few internal analysts and specialists.” Two years ago, Transform’s R&D group searched for a cloud-native data warehouse technology to underpin its vision for the Revenue Data Platform. Transform wanted to equip customers such as Disney, Intel, Macy’s, American Apparel, Verizon and Xerox with timely insights and actionable recommendations to boost revenue growth. The modern cloud data warehouse Transform sought had to bring all revenue-related data into one location so companies could analyze, pinpoint revenue gaps and reposition how they marketed, promoted, priced and sold their products and services. After evaluating a number of cloud database technologies, Transform selected Snowflake for its unique built-for-the-cloud architecture. „Snowflake’s decoupling of storage and compute, its truly elastic nature and ability to syndicate data made it an ideal choice,” said Murali Krishnan, VP of Technology who joined Transform after 22 years at Microsoft. „Snowflake enables our RDP platform to deliver the best of virtually unlimited scalability, security, real-time performance, and cost-effectiveness for our customers.” With Snowflake’s exponentially faster performance, ability to run ad hoc reporting, scale seamlessly from 1gb of data to multi-PBs, Transform customers shifted from analytics performed weekly, monthly or quarterly by the IT team, to real-time analytics performed by anyone involved in revenue generation. For example, Transform’s major retailer customers moved off their legacy systems to RDP powered by Snowflake. These major brands now have a single source of truth for revenue data, direct from ERP and POS sources, and easily integrated with marketing, sales, product and inventory data. Transform also enables retailers to produce predictive insights to improve in-store conversion, product performance, pricing and promotions ROI, customer support insights and enablement, and market opportunities. For example, Transform can quickly uncover why one retailer’s physical store performed significantly better than another. Transform communicates recommended daily actions to store managers to help boost sales based on previous performance, current inventory and evolving customer trends. „Our great aim is not insights or even knowledge, but actions,” said Transform co-founder and COO, Randa Minkarah. „We want to empower everyone within the company who has a role in revenue to take action that yields real incremental customers, sales and revenue.” Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said Transform is one of many innovative SaaS industry analytics solution providers that has chosen Snowflake. „Transform’s innovative application helps enterprises take decisive action to improve their top line, and we’re happy to be an integral part of their solution.” About Transform Transform Inc. is a Seattle-based company launched in 2014 with the first-of-its-kind, data-driven revenue growth platform for enterprise businesses.

By Eugene Kiely, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson Posted on April 25, 2017 Summary In an interview with the Associated Press, President Donald Trump put some spin on what he has done — and hasn’t done — as he nears the completion of his first 100 days in office: Trump said he has not labeled China a currency manipulator, as promised, because it hasn’t manipulated its currency since he took office out of respect for him. The Chinese president “knew I would do something,” Trump said. In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014. The president also said that the wall he wants to build on the Mexico border will cost “$10 billion or less,” but cost estimates by his own Department of Homeland Security and two independent organizations say it could cost at least twice that much. The president also repeated several false and misleading claims, including taking too much credit for job creation. Analysis The Associated Press interviewed Trump in the Oval Office on April 21, and published a transcript of the interview on April 24. The interview comes as the president nears completion of his first 100 days in office — which will occur on April 29 — and dealt in part with the promises he made during the campaign. China’s Currency During the campaign, Trump issued a “100-day action plan to Make America Great Again.” One of those promises dealt with China’s history of devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage. In his action plan, Trump said on his first day in office he would “direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.” That has not happened. In fact, the Treasury Department issued a report on April 14 that declined to label China a currency manipulator. The president told the Associated Press that “things change” and he needs “flexibility” once he takes office. He said the decision was in part political, as he is trying to convince China to lean on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. But then he twisted the facts about China’s history of devaluing its currency. Trump said he decided not to label China a currency manipulator, in part, because it has not manipulated its currency since he took office. Trump claimed credit for that, saying “there’s a certain respect” that China’s President Xi Jinping has for him and “he knew I would do something” if China devalued its currency. In fact, China has not been devaluing its currency to create a trade advantage since 2014, years before Trump took office. Trump, April 21: But [Chinese] President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there’s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he’s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, “By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you’re a currency manipulator.” It doesn’t work that way. … And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don’t get it, in which case they’re very stupid people, or they just don’t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, “He didn’t call them a currency manipulator.” Well, for two reasons. Number One, he’s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it’s like generalities, it’s not. They have — they’ve actually — their currency’s gone up. So it’s a very, very specific formula. And I said, “How badly have they been,” … they said, “Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.” That’s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. As the Washington Post explained, “The value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency manipulation occurs when a country buys or sell [sic] large amounts of its own currency on global markets to change the price. But U.S. policy is really directed at countries that sell large volumes of their own currency to lower its price — a practice that makes a country’s exports relatively cheap on global markets, hurting American exporters. In previous years, when China artificially lowered the value of its currency, it helped the country export products to the United States, and U.S. industries and workers balked at what they saw as an unfair competitive edge.” The Treasury report found that “after engaging in one-way, large-scale intervention to resist appreciation of the RMB [the Chinese currency] for a decade, China’s recent intervention in foreign exchange markets has sought to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have negative consequences for the United States, China, and the global economy.” Moreover, the report notes that China’s “lack of intervention to resist appreciation” has been occurring “over the last three years.” In other words, China didn’t make a change in its policy since Trump took office, or because — as Trump said — of a perceived threat that Trump would “do something.” Economists broadly agree that China has not been holding down its currency since 2014 or 2015. “The accusation that China is manipulating its currency in order to gain an unfair advantage for its exports is not supported by economic facts,” Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and formerly head of the IMF’s China Division, told us in an email. “Since mid-2014, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC, China’s central bank) has in fact been intervening in currency markets to prevent the renminbi (RMB) from falling too sharply in value against the dollar. Over the past three years, China has burnt up $1 trillion of its stock of foreign exchange reserves in order to support its currency and prevent it from depreciating as much and as fast as market forces seem to want.” “Thus, China has, if anything, been doing the U.S. a favor by not letting the RMB depreciate as much and as fast against the dollar as indicated by market pressures,” Prasad said. “The reason it has done this is largely to forestall any domestic financial instability from panic-driven capital outflows if it were to allow the RMB to depreciate a lot, especially over a short period.” Brad Setser, a senior fellow and acting director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said conventional wisdom is that China shifted from buying reserves to selling reserves several years ago. “If by manipulation, you mean – when did China stop accumulating reserves to hold its currency down, it stopped manipulating in 2014 or 2015,” Setser told us via email. But Setser said the issue is made more complex, “because China has held its currency relatively stable against the dollar this year, and that is arguably a change (though holding the currency stable against the dollar has been relatively easy for China because the dollar has been relatively stable or even weakened a bit against the other big currencies).” Some consider manipulation to mean any government intervention in the market at all, not just depreciating currency, Setser said. But it is clear from Trump’s statements that he was concerned about China holding down its currency to gain a trade advantage, to the detriment especially of U.S. manufacturers. Economists say that’s exactly what China was doing for more than a decade, but as Eduardo Porter put it for the New York Times, “Trump Isn’t Wrong on China Currency Manipulation, Just Late.” Trump said his decision to not label China a currency manipulator was partly political, since he is trying to convince China to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. We take no position on that. But Trump’s claim that China stopped manipulating its currency when he took office — and more, that it did so “because there’s a certain respect, because [Xi] knew I would do something or whatever” — is another example of Trump taking credit for something that long predates his presidency. Spinning the Border Wall Costs During the campaign, Trump also promised to build a “big, fat beautiful wall” along the southern border. In his 100-day action plan, Trump said he would work with Congress to fully fund the wall “with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall.” The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as we will explain later, has moved forward with the project, so that promise is a work in progress. But in the AP interview, Trump lowballed the estimated cost of the project, claiming it will cost “$10 billion or less.” Trump, April 21: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I’m seeing. I’m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive. Associated Press: What do you think the estimate on it would be? Trump: Oh I’m seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I’ll do it for $10 billion or less. …  The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It’s not going to cost anywhere near that. Associated Press: You think $10 billion or less. Trump: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it’s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. We can’t predict the future, but the estimates to date have been much higher than $10 billion: According to an internal document obtained by Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security estimated the cost could be as much as $21.6 billion. Bernstein Research, an investment-management and research firm, has estimated that the cost of the project is “widely expected to be greater than $15 billion and perhaps as much as $25 billion.” MIT Technology Review, a magazine published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated in October that a 1,000-mile wall could cost between $27 billion and $40 billion. The cost of the wall will depend on many factors — such as the height and length of the wall, the construction materials used, and whether parts of the wall are substituted with fencing or other barriers. Let’s take a look at what the Trump administration envisions and how much it might cost. On March 17, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals “to acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.” One RFP is for a “solid concrete border wall,” and the second RFP is for “other border wall.” For the “other border wall,” the RPF says: “Prototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).” So, we know that the administration is at least considering not just a solid concrete wall, but a combination of walls and other barriers. The wall — whether solid concrete or an alternative design — must be between 18 feet and 30 feet tall and 2 feet wide, according to the RFPs. It also must go 6 feet below the ground to prevent people from tunneling under the wall. As for the length of the wall, the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,933 miles. But the DHS document obtained by Reuters indicated that the administration will not seek to build new barriers the full length of the border. “The plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020,” Reuters wrote on Feb. 9. “With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.” The 654 miles of existing barriers is a reference, as we have written before, to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology. In its report, Bernstein Research wrote that under the 2006 law “18ft tall steel ‘primary fencing’ is used in many urban areas … to less substantial ‘vehicle fencing’ in lower-risk areas.” The cost of the primary fencing, also known as pedestrian fencing, averaged about $6.5 million per mile under the 2006 law, according to a September 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office. At that per-mile average price (not adjusted for inflation), a 1,250-mile “wall” constructed entirely of pedestrian fencing would cost more than $8 billion. More recently, Trump’s chief budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told talk show host Hugh Hewitt in March that the per-mile cost “starts at $8 million per mile” and “goes up to about $25 million per mile.” The range of Mulvaney’s per-mile cost estimates would place the total cost at between $10 billion and $31.25 billion for 1,250 miles of walls and fences. Mulvaney added that the total cost “just depends on … what you decide to build in what areas.” As we said, Homeland Security estimated that the 1,250-mile combination of fences and walls under the Trump administration plan could cost as much as $21.6 billion. Bernstein Research estimated the cost at between $15 billion and $25 billion. The firm — which provided its estimate during the campaign, when Trump gave no details on the size and scope of the project — assumed construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall at 40 feet tall and 7 feet deep, but only 10 inches thick. MIT Technology Review provided its cost estimate in October. The magazine’s cost estimate of between $27 billion and $40 billion assumes construction of a 1,000-mile concrete wall that is 50 feet tall and 10 feet underground — which is taller and deeper than the specifications ordered by DHS, but not as long. We don’t know what the wall will cost, but independent analyses and Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security say a border wall could cost twice as much as Trump’s figure. Job Creation and Other Repeats In his interview, Trump also repeated claims we have fact-checked before — most of them dealing with his campaign promise to be “the greatest jobs president God has ever created.” Trump once again claimed too much credit for job creation, saying, “we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.” As we wrote two weeks ago, under Trump, the U.S. job growth has been 317,000 jobs in February and March. That’s according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The January job numbers  — an additional 216,000 jobs — were based on a survey that was done before Trump was inaugurated. This job growth is a continuation of a trend that began pre-Trump: The economy added more than 250,000 new jobs a month in 20 of the 96 months under President Obama, and as of March, the U.S. has had 77 straight months of job growth. The president also cited examples of his job creation, and in some cases he took too much credit. Trump: As an example, Ford, General Motors. I’ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma [chairman of Alibaba Group], he comes up, he says, “Only because of you am I making this massive investment.” Intel, only because of you. … The press never writes that. But, as we’ve written before, investments made by Ford and GM were part of longtime trends and market decisions. Ford CEO Mark Fields, for example, praised Trump’s promises to cut taxes and regulation, but said recent investments in U.S. plants were market-based. Asked on Fox Business News if he would have made the investments had Trump not won the election, Fields said, “Yes, absolutely.” As for Intel, we wrote in February that Trump had a stronger case in that instance. The Intel CEO credited Trump’s pro-business policies for a $7 billion investment in an Arizona factory, though Intel had announced a $5 billion investment in that facility in 2011. The project wasn’t completed. “We’re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,” Intel spokesman William Moss said. “That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro business and pro investment goals.” And Jack Ma, of Alibaba, the e-commerce Chinese company, told Trump in early January that he would add 1 million U.S. small businesses to the online platform over the next five years, a move Alibaba said could add 1 million jobs (one each per small business). Trump also again took credit for saving hundreds of millions on the F-35 jet made by Lockheed Martin, savings that were in the works before he was sworn in. “[A] little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget,” he said, going on to say that he called Lockheed and said he would have to “bid this out to another company, namely Boeing” and that “I started getting competing offers back and forth.” Trump claimed he saved $725 million. In the past, he has claimed a savings of $600 million. But as the Washington Post‘s Fact Checker found, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, had already announced on Dec. 19 — before Trump met privately with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson — that the cost of the F-35 would come down. His cost reduction estimate came out to $549 million to $630 million, according to the Post’s calculation. Aviation Week also wrote that Trump “overstates” his role and that the price reduction on the jet had been “ongoing.” In addition, the president rehashed a campaign claim that distorts the facts on the vetting process required for those entering the U.S. Trump: We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. Trump didn’t specify that he was talking about refugees, but he indicated he was speaking about his “stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.” Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump made similar claims. For instance, in a late August speech on illegal immigration, he said that Syrian refugees seeking admission to the U.S. have “no documentation” and “no paperwork.” That’s false. As we wrote, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Congress in October 2015 that “we’ve found with Syrian refugees … in general they have many, many documents.” Documents were also one part of the vetting process, she said. Those applying for refugee status are also interviewed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and go through security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. There’s a health screening and a three-day “cultural orientation,” too.

Military Military: The Intel San Diego destroyer arrives off Korea, part of growing 'armada' North Korea holds artillery drill as tension spikes North Korea puts on a massive live-fire artillery drill as a U.S. submarine docks in the South amid growing concern over Pyongyang's nuclear program. Ryan Brooks reports.   North Korea puts on a massive live-fire artillery drill as a U.S. submarine docks in the South amid growing concern over Pyongyang's nuclear program. Ryan Brooks reports.   Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter Amid escalating tension with North Korea, a San Diego Navy destroyer started two days of exercises with South Korea’s navy off the Korean peninsula. The Wayne E. Meyer -- which left San Diego in January as part of the Carl Vinson carrier group — is operating with the South Korean destroyer Wang Geon in waters west of the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. Navy said in a statement released today. Meanwhile, the U.S. submarine Michigan docked in Busan, South Korea, yesterday. Navy officials said the guided-missile submarine is getting a scheduled port visit during a regular deployment. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The two ships are part of what’s a growing show of U.S. naval forces around Asia as North Korea threatens to test more of its missiles and even sink an aircraft carrier. The U.S. destroyer Fitzgerald is also doing exercises for the next couple days with the Japanese destroyer Chokai in waters west of Japan. Two days ago, the Vinson and the San Diego-based cruiser Lake Champlain commenced exercises with two Japanese navy ships while traveling through the Philippine Sea. On April 11, President Donald Trump said he was sending an “armada” toward Korea as a muscle-flexing move during an escalation in tension over nuclear weapon capabilities. The Vinson group was said to change plans and rush toward Korea. However, the Vinson group surprised the world by first heading to the Indian Ocean for planned exercises with Australia. The confusion has been chalked up to crossed wires between the military and the White House, Caption Congress considering new 'tax' on troops for GI Bill A new proposal in Congress would impose a new $2,400 fee on troops who want to sign up to get the GI Bill after discharge.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ALCF Seeking Proposals to Advance Big Data Problems in Big Science The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility Data Science Program (ADSP) is now accepting proposals for projects hoping to gain insight into very large datasets produced by experimental, simulation, or observational methods. The larger the data, in fact, the better. From April 24 to June 15, ADSP’s open call provides an opportunity for researchers to make transformational advances in data science and software technology through allocations of computer time and supporting resources at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. The ADSP, now in its second year, is the first program of its kind in the nation, and targets “big data” science problems that require the scale and performance of leadership computing resources, such as ALCF’s two petascale supercomputers: Mira, an IBM Blue Gene/Q, and Theta, an Intel/Cray system that came online earlier this year. Data—the raw, voluminous, bits and bytes that pour out of today’s large-scale experiments—are the proverbial haystacks to the science community’s needles. Data analysis is the art (of sorts) of sorting and making sense of the output of supercomputers, telescopes, particle accelerators, and other big instruments of scientific discovery. ADSP projects will focus on employing leadership-class systems and infrastructure to explore, prove, and improve a wide range of data science techniques. These techniques include uncertainty quantification, statistics, machine learning, deep learning, databases, pattern recognition, image processing, graph analytics, data mining, real-time data analysis, and complex and interactive workflows. The winning proposals will be awarded time on ALCF resources and will receive support and training from dedicated ALCF staff. Applications undergo a review process to evaluate potential impact, data scale readiness, diversity of science domains and algorithms, and other criteria. This year, there will be an emphasis on identifying projects that can use the architectural features of Theta in particular, as future ADSP projects will eventually transition to Aurora, ALCF’s 200-petaflops Intel/Cray system expected to arrive late next year. To submit an application or for additional details about the proposal requirements, visit http://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-data-science-program. Proposals will be accepted until the call deadline of 5 p.m. CDT on Thursday, June 15, 2017. Awards will be announced in September and commence October 1, 2017. Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline. Argonne researchers work closely with researchers from hundreds of companies, universities, and federal, state and municipal agencies to help them solve their specific problems, advance America’s scientific leadership and prepare the nation for a better future. With employees from more than 60 nations, Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now With workplace cyberattacks on the rise, industry experts are pressing businesses to train their workers to be more vigilant than ever to protect passwords and sensitive data and to recognize threats. “It is imperative for organizations of all sizes to instill among employees the critical role they play in keeping their workplace safe and secure,” said Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, a group that promotes education on the safe and secure use of the internet. The group's members include such major technology companies as Cisco, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft. Kaiser made his comments timed with last week’s release of a Dell End-User Security Survey that found that 72% of workers are willing to share confidential company information without regard for proper data security protocols. The survey was conducted online in late February and early March with results from 2,608 professionals in companies with more than 250 workers. “Cybersecurity education needs to be an integral part of the workplace culture,” Kaiser added. “Cybersecurity education doesn’t mean hosting a one-time course or seminar; it means making security a collaborative, continuous cultural initiative.” Creating a security culture at a company can be complicated. The survey found that 65% of employees recognize their responsibility to protect confidential information, but many said security programs limit their productivity. Of those who received cybersecurity training at work, 24% admitted they went ahead and used unsafe behaviors anyway in order to complete a task. There is a “balance between protecting your data and empowering employees to be productive,” said Brett Hansen, vice president of endpoint security and management at Dell. Data security needs to be the top priority “while maintaining productivity,” Hansend said. It's a difficult task that requires companies to create simple, clear policies that address potential breaches. The survey found that unsafe behaviors for accessing, sharing and storing data are common in the workplace. Forty-six percent of employees admitted to connecting to public Wi-Fi to access confidential information, while 49% admitted to using a personal email account for work tasks. The survey found 35% said it was common to take corporate information with them when leaving a company. “As the Dell survey clearly indicates, there is still much work to be done regarding cybersecurity education and training for employees,” said Kristin Judge, director of government relations for the Alliance, via email.   “The trend we are seeing is one of creating a culture of cybersecurity within an organization, which means taking cybersecurity best practices out of the IT department and bringing them into the risk management discussion… Effectively responding to cyber threats is relatively new on the list of day-to-day business practices -- so it will take some time to establish and instill widespread organizational change.” The alliance urges companies to talk frequently to workers about: Rules for keeping a clean machine, including what programs, apps and data that workers can install and keep on their work computers; Best practices for passwords, including making them long and strong, with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, and changing them routinely; Throwing out suspicious links in email, tweets, posts, online ads, messages or attachments—even if they know the source; Remembering to back up work, based on the policies of each company; Speaking up if they notice strange happenings on their computer. For business travelers going abroad, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center has posted a series of travel tips. They include suggestions such as taking a different mobile phone from the one you typically use and checking for updated cybersecurity alerts at the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team’s website.

Blog :  Pluribus Networks Extends SDN Reach Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar Pivot3 Hooks HCI Platforms Up to NVMe Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 25 Apr, 2017          |         |     Share Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) has been all the rage in IT circles as of late, but most IT organizations don’t yet fully appreciate just how converged things may soon get. As systems that support the NVM Express (NVMe) interface developed by Intel become more widely available, the level of application performance that can be achieved on HCI systems is about to substantially increase. Pivot3 today announced it will become one of the first providers of HCI systems to add support for NVMe PCIe flash in the form of systems dubbed Acuity. Pivot3 says these systems will be 450 percent faster than SATA solid-state drives (SSDs) and 119 percent faster than SAS SSDs. Company CEO Ron Nash says this is significant because it increases the number and types of application workloads that can efficiently be deployed on an HCI platform. “HCI can be used for about 60 percent of application workloads today,” says Nash. “We think that’s about to move up to 80 to 85 percent.” Nash says the Acuity platform represents the first new HCI platform Pivot3 has rolled out since acquiring NexGen Storage last year. Naturally, competition across the HCI sector is fierce and without a doubt every provider of this class of platforms will be embracing NMVe. Nash says one of the things that differentiates Pivot3 the most is that it has developed a quality-of-service (QoS) engine that gives IT organizations the ability to define policies to determine the exact amount of resources any application running on an HCI platform should receive. That’s about to become a bigger issue, says Nash, because the next generation of HCI platforms that make use of NVMe will be able to more easily support multiple applications. Just how HCI platforms will ultimately impact IT organizations as compute and storage continue to be unified remains to be seen. But the one thing that is for certain is that a much greater percentage of the systems being deployed going forward are going to be in the form of one type of HCI platform or another.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Intel’s 3D XPoint Optane SSD and Optane Memory are now available Intel’s 3D XPoint Optane SSD and Optane Memory are now available Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago Featured Tech News, SSD Drives Following on from last month’s announcements, this week Intel’s first 3D XPoint products officially became available. For the budget-oriented market, there is Optane Memory, a small M.2 cache drive intended to boost mechanical HDD performance, meanwhile for data-centres, Intel has the Optane DC P4800X, a super speedy PCIe SSD built using 3D XPoint memory. The Optane DC P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than many leading SSDs and should help fill the gap created by DRAM shortages. According to Intel, this drive is particularly ideal for “critical applications with aggressive latency requirements”. This makes sense, as 3D XPoint is built to offer extremely low latency while being built to last. In terms of read and write speeds, this SSD offers up to 2GB/s over a PCIe connection. It consumes around 14 watts under heavy load, making it very power efficient, another thing that is increasingly important for server farms and data centres. This particular SSD will be available directly through Intel, with the 375GB version costing $1520. In the future though, there will be 750GB and 1.5TB versions. For those who don’t have thousands of pounds, there is Optane Memory. These 16GB or 32GB M.2 cache SSDs cost $44 and $77 respectively and are intended to help speed up boot and load times for users who only have a mechanical hard drive to work with. According to Intel’s own stats, Optane Memory should provide up to a 67 percent performance boost when paired with a HDD. The let down here is that Optane Memory compatibility is limited to 200-series motherboards and Kaby Lake (or newer) processors. So unless you’re building a budget system right now in 2017, then you may not be able to use this new tech at all. You can check the full list of compatible motherboards and CPUs, HERE.

An article in the April 3, 2017 issue of Pension & Investments states that Comptroller Stringer objects to the fact that virtual-only meetings — conducted solely by remote communications such as online access — create barriers by filtering exchanges and "cherry picking" the shareholders who are allowed to ask questions. According to Michael Garland, NYC assistant comptroller for corporate governance, virtual-only meetings "prevent shareholder proposal proponents from presenting resolutions directly to boards and senior management," adding that it's important for shareholders and corporate executives to "interact face-to-face" in a live meeting. Mr. Stringer's office will be sending letters to S&P 500 corporations, such as Duke Energy, Ford, Intel, and ConocoPhillips, asking them to stop using virtual-only meetings and return to live or hybrid meetings. This requirement will be expanded to all shareholder companies by next year's annual meeting. The virtual-meeting only ban is a welcome opportunity for P&V Enterprises, who specialize in conducting both virtual-only and hybrid meetings that combine a "live" in-person event with a "virtual" online component. The NYC-based, husband-and-wife firm has over 55 years' experience in theatrical staging, technology, and multi-media production, and has operated a subsidiary PNVWebcasts for the past seven years. According to P&V partner and executive producer Vince Ahaesy, "A virtual meeting is where the entire audience is viewing or listening online only and not present at the meeting venue. A hybrid meeting combines both a live audience and an audience listening and/or viewing the event over the internet. A hybrid meeting can be simultaneously broadcast to online participants and incorporate text messaging from the internet audience and up to 8 live speakers from most parts of the world." Ahaesy explains that a virtual-only meeting can incorporate live participation from the audience, too. "It's a question of management and the priorities of the client holding the meeting. Of course, it's more difficult to avoid questions and comments when there are live people in the room than it is to ignore remote viewers, but good results are possible with virtual-only meetings when they are managed and produced properly. The communication can be two-way and relevant." Pat Ahaesy, P&V president and partner, concurs. "Hybrid meetings, which combine a live audience with a virtual audience from anywhere in the world, do offer a more interesting and fun experience for all concerned. The two-way component is the key to a productive and informative meeting, no matter which way you do it. This can be achieved by using text, tweets, and any social media platform, as well as live through return audio or audio/video played in the meeting room, as well as to all internet attendees. Text seems to be the most accepted means of return comments and questions, enabling participation to the entire web audience. "In our experience, it's best when the audio or audio/video is kept to about 6 to 8 participants," says Vince Ahaesy, "usually major participants or speakers who couldn't make it to the live event. If you expand that to include all audience participation, it feels like you're herding cats and it can become a fail point. Text seems to be used most often as it's usually the most practical method for return comments and questions, giving the entire web audience participation. More people will be comfortable using this than other methods." The participation level between the virtual audience and the live event is a function of the client and the producer. There must be someone from the client in the control room to decide who speaks and when, just like a moderator on the stage for the live event. As it is not always possible to get to everyone who wants to be heard, the discussion can go on after the event as a text-messaging or live-chat follow up, or a continuation of the webcast at an agreed-upon time.

Create an Account By Starla Pointer • Staff Writer • April 24, 2017 Tweet Y-C School Board race: Watson challenges Nettles YAMHILL-CARLTON — Incumbent Holly Nettles, operations manager with the Yamhill Community Care Organization, is facing a challenge from Ken Watson, a retired Yamhill-Carlton teacher now serving as Yamhill Fire Department chaplain, for Position 5 on the Yamhill-Carlton School Board. Voters will fill the post in a mail-ballot election concluding Tuesday, May 16. Ballots must be returned to the Yamhill County Clerk’s Office, by mail or in person, by 8 p.m. election night. The Watson-Nettles race is one of two in the district this spring. In addition, incumbent Jami Egland, a state employee with a business in Carlton, is facing a challenge from Terah Long Mitchell, who works for Intel, for Position 1. Look for a story about that race in the Friday News-Register. Software engineering manager William “Jack” Bibb Jr. is running unopposed for Position 4. Rick Yeo, who currently holds the seat, is not seeking re-election. Nettles, a six-year Yamhill resident, was appointed to the board in August 2015 to replace Carlton resident Carol West. Nettles previously worked with other volunteers on the Ford Foundation project supplying bike racks to Yamhill and Carlton. She was one of five who applied for appointment to the seat. Being appointed to the board offered her a chance to serve the community and learn more about the school district, said Nettles, who has two children, now in the second and fifth grades. “I love this community, and I wanted to be a good role model,” she said. She said being able to listen to constituents and make tough decisions are key elements to the job. “I’ve been very proud of the board we have,” she said. “We don’t always see things the same way, but we usually come to consensus.”   Board members “get to find out all the amazing things we are doing in the district,” she said. “It’s so rewarding to see the impact you’re having on children’s lives.” She said she enjoys the student and teacher presentations at each meeting. For instance, students from the elementary school recently told board members about their good behavior game. “I feel so connected to the schools,” she said. “I feel so blessed to live here.” Nettles helped campaign for the $14.2 million bond measure voters approved last May. It will pay for repairs across the district and build a new high school gym and career tech education center. Some of the work, such as addressing deferred maintenance, is already underway; major construction will begin this summer. Seeing the sorely needed bond projects come to fruition is one reason Nettles is seeking to retain her seat. “I want to be part of that process,” she said. “I feel this is the best way for me to be involved and help lead the district in positive directions. There’s a lot more work to do.” Nettles added she wants to help the district deal with challenges such as balancing the budget in light of a state funding shortfall. “We’re looking to try to stretch every penny as far as we can,” she said. She noted Y-C is putting together its budget based on “one of the potential lowest funding scenarios.” That way, the district can add features if more money comes in, rather than having to make additional cuts. Next year, Y-C High will have an official student representative at each board meeting. The rep not only will report to the board about high school activities, but will return to his or her school to tell other students what the board is doing. Nettles said she’s excited about the prospect. She wants to increase communication between the district, community members and students. She especially wants people to know they are welcome at board meetings, held at 7 p.m. on the second Monday of each month. If they can’t attend, meeting minutes are available on the district’s website, she notes. Nettles said she favors “better communication and transparency.” Without good communication, she said, it’s easy for people to hear misinformation and make assumptions.  “We really have to be pro-active,” she said. “We need to work together to create positive change. “Democracy is not a spectator sport. We really have to get involved.” Watson taught for 30 years at Yamhill Grade School and retired in 2005. He now volunteers as a pastor with the fire department and his church.  “I love my community,” he said. “I’m blessed to be member. I’m looking for ways to contribute to help the community to be such a good place.” He supported the efforts to pass the Y-C School District’s construction and remodeling measure last year. This spring, he filed to run for office because he wants to bring his expertise to the school board. Watson said he sees the role of board members as making sure the district “educates kids and gives kids the skills they need to effectively be part of the workforce and society.” While he’s always believed in teaching basic skills, he said, “Increasingly, I’m a believer that teaching kids to be good problem-solvers and apply knowledge is just as important.” As a former teacher, Watson believes teachers are important. Administrators and board members must support the teaching staff, he said. The school board needs to represent the concerns of the community, as well, he said. He took note of the recent controversy over a book, “Eleanor & Park,” being used in eighth-grade classes at YCIS. The novel contains multiple examples of foul language and references to budding sexuality. Citizens filled the board room to speak for and against “Eleanor & Park,” and the board ended up removing it from use. After a second, equally passionate meeting, the board appointed a review committee to make recommendations. “I agreed with the position the board took that the book wasn’t appropriate for the way it was being used,” Watson said. He said he was happy the board listened to all the public comments. “As a teacher, I know sometimes well-intentioned teachers need reminders to be respectful of the concerns of students’ families,” he said. In general, Watson said, “I’m pretty happy with the school system in Yamhill.” He said he has no real complaints about the administration, which has “managed to preserve a good learning environment for the most part and be responsive.” Watson called himself a social conservative. “But that doesn’t mean I’m desiring to turn the schools into a reflection of my strong religious beliefs,” he said, “as much as it reflects my concern that schools can become excessively involved as leaders of social change. On that I would be socially conservative.” He said he believes students have a right to free speech and expression. However, he said, schools “don’t necessarily need to give them a megaphone.” Another challenge for the school board this year, and in feature years, will be funding. Watson said Y-C may face funding shortages because of state cuts and rising PERS costs. The latter is “a huge challenge,” he said, noting he is a beneficiary himself. “It won’t be the position of our board to solve the PERS crisis, but it will be a challenge for us to wrestle with the effects.” He said he believes in strong investment in public education. As a school board member, though, he will have to recognize that funds are limited and deal with that. “There will be challenges and the need for restraint for educational bodies to be realistic in view of current economic realities for all public employers,” he said.   Related Articles AN F.A.Q.

This is my 25th NAB. I have only missed two days (due to my grandfather’s passing) in the 25 years. When I started coming in 1992, I was a senior in college. One day, a bunch of us were discussing what equipment to buy to start our own projects and our businesses, S-VHS or Hi-8. The chief engineer of the campus studio, who overheard the conversation, told us that none of us should be allowed to graduate without going to NAB. He told us that is where you need to go to get all of your questions answered. Back then there was no internet to do research.  I packed up and headed out to Vegas for my first time. As I made my way past the banks of portable pay phones, (back then only the top execs could afford the two-pound cell phones), I marveled at the interesting exhibits, then I found out that was just the lobby. I wasn’t on the show floor yet. Once I found my way there — a whole other story due to not having a properly processed badge — I found out that if your badge says “Student,” no one will talk to you. Apparently students are all “starving” and don’t have money. I did learn a lot, though. I used to call my dad every night after the show closed and tell him about all of the cool new things I saw. He would say to me, “Cool, yes. But do we really need it? If we get it, how long will it take to make it pay for itself and make us money?” Even though he passed away over 10 years ago, I still mentally have these conversations with him. The answers are pretty similar to the ROI product reviews I have been doing for StudioDaily for the last 11 years. I’m honored to be covering the show for StudioDaily once again. Without further delay, here are some of the cool products I discovered on NAB 2017 day 1: HP DreamColor Z31x Studio Display (4K) This new display from HP to be released later this year has some amazing features never seen before in a studio reference display — or probably any other display. It has built in calibration, no additional hardware needed. It has a small calibration tool that automatically folds down from the top of the display to make sure the colors are true to spec. Displays must warm up for 50 minutes in order to get the truest picture, so HP built in a programmable timer that can not only turn on the Z31x 50 minutes before you arrive at work but also program the calibration process to start after so many hours of use. As this display may be used with more than one computer, it has a built in KVM switch so you can control multiple computers with one keyboard and mouse through this reference monitor. Its sub-$4000 price range will probably shake up the world of expensive 4K reference monitors. HP Zbook 17 G4 HP’s line-up of mobile workstations keeps getting more and more powerful, and can easily rival desktop workstations. CPUs range from a basic Intel Core i5 to a 3.1 GHz Quad-core (8-thread) Xeon, with up to 64 GB RAM and up to an Nvidia P5000 with 16 GB of discrete graphics. The Zbook 17 G4 is also available, with the optional DreamColor display and touch display options. Prices vary depending on options. FeiuyTech G5 Gimbal This action-cam carrying gimbal has a number of unique features that I haven’t seen in other similar gimbals. a) For set-up (and multiple other uses) it has a mini tripod built into the grip. b) A button on the grip enables and disables the rotation correction. For instance, if you are in a car, and it is on, and you want to turn the camera from looking ahead to looking to the driver on the left, the gimbal will keep the camera facing forward. If you turn it off, it will only correct for the up and down motion and swinging motion and you can turn it to the driver. c) It is rugged. On Sunday, the FeiuyTech took a number of press off-roading in fast off-road vehicles. I was holding one, shooting laps while going over jumps. On landing, the force of the impact of hitting the ground caused me to slam the gimbal into the unpadded tubular roof support. The gimbal continued to function without issue. d) You can customize the gimabal’s function via an app. For instance, if you want there to be a bit more or less camera shake, you can program the gimbal’s motors for more or less motion compensation. Yi 4K+ action cam This long-anticipated action cam takes quality to a new level with the ability to record 4K at 60p. This bests the industry’s most widely recognized action cam, the GoPro 5, which tops out at 4K 30p. The Yi is also less expensive, at around $350 to the GoPro 5 Black at $399, and uses the same high quality Sony sensor. Additionally, it can be controlled with a smartphone app and can take 12-megapixel stills. Sony PXW-X70 4K Software Upgrade The Sony PXW-X70 was released in 2014 as a 1080p HD camcorder. It has a one-inch Exmor CMOS sensor, dual XLR audio inputs, a 12x Zeiss lens and HDMI and HD-SDI out. Now you can purchase a software upgrade that will give this full-featured, lightweight and compact camera 4K 24p/25p/30p recording modes and 4K live out through HDMI for $499. For all the benefits that 4K gives you, even if you’re still working in HD, it’s probably worth the investment. Sennheiser MKE 2 This microphone from Sennheiser was developed as an audio solution for the normally horrible sound recorded by action cams. GoPro worked with Sennheiser to make a waterproof microphone that could attach to the GoPro Hero 4. The microphone features a windscreen that looks fluffy but is actually quite stiff and helps the mic work under water. Right now the MKE 2 will only work with the GoPro 4 series. The mic is available for $199. Blackmagic Design Davinci Resolve 14 Beta Integrating their latest acquisition, audio company Fairlight, Resolve now has the ability to do a full audio mix without additional audio editing applications. It will also integrate with Fairlight’s audio accelerator card and new console for a more hands on approach. Performance enhancements will make a number of color-correction and effects 10 x faster. The basic version is free and in beta now; the Resolve Studio upgrade is $299. Blackmagic Design ATEM Television Studio Pro HD This is BMD’s first switcher and console in one unit. The a price is less than half the cost of their basic switcher console (switcher not included). It has four each of HDMI and HD-SDI inputs for a total of eight inputs available at once and has a top resolution of 1080 60p. It can also be controlled with a computer interface as previous models. At an MSRP of $2,295, these are revolutionary features, considering what control surfaces usually sell for.   Did you enjoy this article?

Launched back in 2013, G-Sync is a piece of Nvidia tech housed in certain computer monitors and gaming laptops to increase their performance, with a focus on reducing input lag and eliminating screen tearing. If you're in the market for a new PC monitor or a G-Sync gaming laptop, you'll want to know the benefits of G-Sync — as well as how it compares to AMD's FreeSync alternative. What is screen tearing? One of biggest benefits of a G-Sync monitor or laptop display is its ability to resolve an issue known as screen tearing. In certain cases, the video signal from the graphics card will output to the monitor at a rate the display is not capable of handling, which results in a horizontal line or "tear" across the screen. Traditionally, this is helped by enabling V-Sync within a game's settings menu to throttle the output from the graphics card to match the monitor and avoid screen tearing. However, enabling V-Sync can introduce input lag and put a greater strain on your graphics card, which in turn, can affect overall performance during gameplay. How is G-Sync better than V-Sync? While V-Sync makes the graphics card change its output to work better with your monitor, G-Sync works by directly controlling the display to handle the video signal from the graphics card. This eliminates the drawbacks of V-Sync while still avoiding screen tearing. Because monitors have a fixed refresh period and graphics cards have inconsistent output based on the image they're rendering, problems arise when graphics cards output too quickly or too slowly to the monitor. G-Sync changes the monitor's refresh rate so that it works best with what the graphics card is delivering, including making real-time predictions of the graphics card output based on recent performance. What are the best laptops with G-Sync support? Nvidia brought G-Sync support to gaming laptops in 2015, delivering all of the benefits of a G-Sync monitor to a laptop display. Interestingly, Nvidia makes use of its G-Sync tech without relying on the same chip needed in stand-alone PC monitors, instead making use of the graphics card to control output and avoid screen tears or input lag. MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops The Alienware 17 R4 comes in two G-Sync configurations, currently starting at $2,199, and compares well to high-end PC gaming rigs. The base G-Sync model comes equipped with a GTX 1070 and an Intel i7-7700, but those can be bumped up to a GTX 1080 and an i7-7820 for $2,499. Either model is more than enough to tackle new releases at the display's 1440p resolution with full G-Sync support. But if you're looking for a no-compromise portable gaming machine, the Origin PC Eon17-SLX 10 Series for the princely sum of $4,708 will get you there (and back again). Stocked with a 4K G-Sync display and two GTX 1080s, this would hard to beat for any gaming setup, be it a console, laptop or desktop gaming PC. What are some good G-Sync monitors? Among our top picks for PC monitors over at sister site Tom's Guide, we reviewed three G-Sync displays worth considering. The Dell 24 S2417DG comes in at a remarkably low $469 for a 1440p, 24-inch screen with G-Sync support. But you can go further up the scale with the $1,290 Acer Predator X34, a 34-inch, 1440p, curved display designed to fill your field of view. If you're looking for a 4K G-Sync experience, the Acer Predator XB321HK is our pick. This 32-inch display lists for $1,399 and represents a high end for gaming monitors, coming equipped with onboard software extras and strong built-in speakers. How does G-Sync differ from FreeSync? Nvidia's G-Sync and AMD's FreeSync accomplish a lot of the same things, just through different methods. Both of them combat screen tearing by employing "adaptive sync" technology to avoid the input lag of traditional V-Sync. However, G-Sync does hold an edge when working with low frame rates that can arise during graphically intense moments. Lower frame rates will cause a FreeSync monitor to fall back on traditional V-Sync methods, which brings back the old issues of either input lag or screen tearing if you choose to disable V-Sync. A G-Sync monitor doesn't make the same use of V-Sync, instead handling low frame rate issues on its own. Another major difference is the proprietary nature of G-Sync, which requires a special Nvidia chip to be installed in the monitor or laptop. AMD FreeSync is an open standard that makes use of pre-existing DisplayPort technology, which helps keep the cost down compared to equivalent G-Sync monitors. Compare this Asus G-Sync 24-inch 1080p monitor at $449.99 to this Asus FreeSync display of the same size and resolution, which sells for only $179.99. What does G-Sync mean for 4K and HDR? When you get a new G-Sync monitor, you're not just getting a display capable of handling issues with frame rates, screen tearing and input lag. According to Nvidia, you're also getting the latest perks of 4K and HDR gaming. New G-Sync monitors come outfitted with the latest improvements to make the most of 4K and HDR (high dynamic range), with features like better backlighting and quantum dot technology to increase the color depth delivered by the latest standards in HDR. G-Sync HDR displays are not only useful for the latest graphics cards; they're also a good fit for HDR-enabled gaming consoles such as the PS4, PS4 Pro and Xbox One S. Is G-Sync worth it? If you're looking for a display that won't get in the way of visual fidelity or gameplay performance, you should strongly consider a G-Sync monitor or laptop. It'll help you take full advantage of the rest of your hardware without forcing compromises like input lag. For competitive gaming and best-in-class visual fidelity, a G-Sync display is an essential part of the package. Which GPU is Right For You The Best Laptops for Every Need Our Favorite Gaming Keyboards Add a comment Email Firstname Name Comment 4 comments TREY LONG Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 8:22 pm G sync is clearly superior as testing when lower frame rates enter the picture, as they often do with AMD GPUs. For customers who want the best, it's currently Nvidia. William Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 7:12 pm G-sync in a laptop doesn't use any special chip at all. It intact is a software based version on laptops that have a special cookie (licence) embedded into the laptops bios with GPU ID, screen model as well as system info tried together in an encrypted string for when the Nvidia driver loads during kernel level it checks verifies and then enables gsync. Also. The GPU has to be a gsync version which also includes a special vbios. Factual Fred Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 4:08 pm As uber powerful custom gaming rig builders we recommend Nvidia's superior Gsync monitors along with their performance per watt dominating GPUs the same goes for gaming laptops. You get what you pay for, Gsync is worth the extra up front investment for its many long term visual advantages, Gsync gaming is a must have. anonymous Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 9:02 am And now the comparison between G-Sync and FreeSync: Advantages of FreeSync: Higher theoretical range Lower input lag (no additional buffer layer) Many more monitors available FREE (as opposed to $100 to $200 of the G-Sync module) You don't need an Nvidia GPU, it's an open standard Options to change what happens when FPS is outside of range (for example run max monitor refresh rate with V-Sync or without V-Sync) Advantages of G-Sync: Absolutely none Back to top Find a Review All Categories Laptops Tablets Accessories All Subcategories Business Desktop Replacement Gaming Multimedia Student Brand ASUS Acer Alienware Aorus Apple CTL Corp.

However, if you have a strict budget of $700, it's a little more difficult to find a system that meets your appropriately high expectations. Over on our forums, user Shiveng asks for help finding a sub-$700 notebook with a full HD (1080p), a slim chassis and enough performance for video editing and entertainment. Shiveng also names a discrete graphics card and the latest Intel "Kaby Lake" CPUs as nice-to-haves but not absolute requirements. In the original post, Shiveng says that this outdated Lenovo Ideapad 700, which uses an older 6th-Generation CPU and a mechanical hard drive, seems like a decent deal, because Amazon has it for $609. However, the Ideapad 700 is not only a discontinued model from last year, but it's also a bit bulky and its hard drive is a major drawback. We recommend that consumers buy laptops with Solid State Drives whenever possible, because SSDs boot, launch programs and do anything involving disk activity three times faster than HDDs. If Shiveng wants an extremely portable and premium design, we strongly recommend the Asus ZenBook UX330UA. This 13.3-inch laptop has an aluminum lid and weighs just 2.7 pounds, but it also has a 1080p screen, a Kaby Lake Core-i5 CPU and a 256GB SSD. It even lasts over 10 hours on a charge. The UX330UA offers performance that's good enough for some video editing, but it doesn't have discrete graphics. While it's a much-heavier 5.6-pounds and doesn't have the attractive design of the UX330UA, Acer's Aspire E 15 E5-575G-57D4 gives a 15.6-inch, 1080p screen, Nvidia 940MX graphics, a 256GB SSD and an Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-7200U CPU for just $599. To find a laptop with a discrete GPU and a faster, quad-core CPU for under $700, Shiveng may want to consider an older model that's technically discontinued but still for sale. Amazon has the 2015 version of the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 gaming laptop for just $669 with a quad-core Core-i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, a 1080p screen and Nvidia GTX 960M graphics. While the laptop has a 6th-Gen processor and a last-gen Nvidia card, getting an equivalent model with current-generation products would be hundreds of dollars more. We really like the Inspiron 15 7000, in both its current and previous generations, because of its attractive design, comfy keyboard and fantastic value. We'd go for the lighter UX330UA with its 10 hours of battery life, but any of the three laptops we recommended above will give Shiveng performance that's good enough for some video editing, along with a sharp 1080p screen. Most importantly, they all have SSDs. ✖ Laptop Guide Laptop Buying Guide: 8 Essential Tips The Best & Worst Laptop Brands Laptop Tech Support Showdown: Undercover Report Should I Buy a Chromebook?

I just picked up a refurbished 15.6" with one for $1200. The newer Nvidia cards get a lot more performance out of the same power draw, and they really dont cost THAT much more. The 1060 is the sweetspot in price, performance, and portability for me. The 1070 is a better card BY A LOT, but those laptops thend to be a lot thicker and they cost a good chunk more than the 1060 usually. Hope that helps! Nicholas Bohn Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 12:40 pm Anyone who's looking for a PC that's portable, and has discrete graphics, and has powerful processing should look at gaming PC's. Asus ROG series is a nice one. MSI also makes a bunch of good options. You're always going to be trying to balance cost-performance-capability. For the price difference, the value between the 6th gen i7-6700 and the i7-7700 isn't worth it. So you're looking for an i7-6700 with a GTX 1050 Ti Graphics card @ the $1k price point, and a GTX 960M at the $700 price point. You likely aren't going to get an SSD at those prices, which would be really nice to have so if you can get one do it! RAM should be around 8gb or so, which should be fine since your graphics card memory is more important. Try to get the 4 or 6gb cards, not the 2 or 3 gb cards. Bigger bulkier models will give you more performance per dollar, that'd be the sacrifice I would make. Also don't buy anything with a touchscreen or a 4K monitor, at your price point they're luxuries you can't afford. Denis Says: April 23rd, 2017 at 8:43 am Hi, I`m too looking for a laptop for video editing and photoshop but my budget is little higher. I can`t decide between these three. What would you recommend?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Transform Builds its Big Data, Revenue Analytics SaaS Solution on Top of Snowflake The #1 Cloud Data Warehouse chosen over the competition for its innovative technology and built-for-the-cloud architecture SAN MATEO, CA–(Marketwired – Apr 25, 2017) – Snowflake, the data warehouse built for the cloud, today announced that Transform Inc., developer of the first enterprise Revenue Data Platform or RDP, has selected Snowflake as the foundational data store for its software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that delivers high performance, big data analytics to enterprises keen to optimize their ability to grow revenue. Transform’s enterprise SaaS platform is the only all-in-one big data analytics platform designed specifically for enterprise revenue acceleration. It features a self-constructing data engine that ingests and models specific threads of data from a customer’s internal information systems, online ad systems, and third-party data services. The platform’s role-based machine learning BOTS provide insights, predictions and recommendations specific to users with job functions across the overall sales and marketing organization. As a result, Transform’s RDP delivers a 10x reduction in the time and cost of legacy enterprise business intelligence implementations and enables businesses to optimize their sales, marketing, advertising, channels, promotions and incentives.  „We believe that businesses should be getting a lot more from the massive investments they make in sales and marketing — more sustainable and predictable revenue growth. And we believe that data is the key. So, we’re changing the game for enterprise business intelligence, proving it doesn’t have to take years and cost millions of dollars,” Transform’s co-founder and CEO, Tom Chiarella said. „Furthermore, we believe that our customers require actions, not simply charts and graphs geared for a few internal analysts and specialists.” Two years ago, Transform’s R&D group searched for a cloud-native data warehouse technology to underpin its vision for the Revenue Data Platform. Transform wanted to equip customers such as Disney, Intel, Macy’s, American Apparel, Verizon and Xerox with timely insights and actionable recommendations to boost revenue growth. The modern cloud data warehouse Transform sought had to bring all revenue-related data into one location so companies could analyze, pinpoint revenue gaps and reposition how they marketed, promoted, priced and sold their products and services. After evaluating a number of cloud database technologies, Transform selected Snowflake for its unique built-for-the-cloud architecture. „Snowflake’s decoupling of storage and compute, its truly elastic nature and ability to syndicate data made it an ideal choice,” said Murali Krishnan, VP of Technology who joined Transform after 22 years at Microsoft. „Snowflake enables our RDP platform to deliver the best of virtually unlimited scalability, security, real-time performance, and cost-effectiveness for our customers.” With Snowflake’s exponentially faster performance, ability to run ad hoc reporting, scale seamlessly from 1gb of data to multi-PBs, Transform customers shifted from analytics performed weekly, monthly or quarterly by the IT team, to real-time analytics performed by anyone involved in revenue generation. For example, Transform’s major retailer customers moved off their legacy systems to RDP powered by Snowflake. These major brands now have a single source of truth for revenue data, direct from ERP and POS sources, and easily integrated with marketing, sales, product and inventory data. Transform also enables retailers to produce predictive insights to improve in-store conversion, product performance, pricing and promotions ROI, customer support insights and enablement, and market opportunities. For example, Transform can quickly uncover why one retailer’s physical store performed significantly better than another. Transform communicates recommended daily actions to store managers to help boost sales based on previous performance, current inventory and evolving customer trends. „Our great aim is not insights or even knowledge, but actions,” said Transform co-founder and COO, Randa Minkarah. „We want to empower everyone within the company who has a role in revenue to take action that yields real incremental customers, sales and revenue.” Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said Transform is one of many innovative SaaS industry analytics solution providers that has chosen Snowflake. „Transform’s innovative application helps enterprises take decisive action to improve their top line, and we’re happy to be an integral part of their solution.” About Transform Transform Inc. is a Seattle-based company launched in 2014 with the first-of-its-kind, data-driven revenue growth platform for enterprise businesses. Transform’s customers gain the ability to predict and optimize all aspects of revenue generation including marketing, sales and product strategies. Transform provides data collection, refinement and analysis that is delivered as visualized recommendations. The result is rapid action to drive top line growth. For more information on Transform, please visit www.transform.co. About Snowflake Snowflake is the only data warehouse built for the cloud. Snowflake delivers the performance, concurrency and simplicity needed to store and analyze all an organization’s data in one location. Snowflake’s technology combines the power of data warehousing, the flexibility of big data platforms and the elasticity of the cloud at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Tracking Pai's next steps on net neutrality By Li Zhou 04/25/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Margaret Harding McGill and Ashley Gold TRACKING PAI’S NET NEUTRALITY NEXT STEPS — FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has two speeches lined up this week, including one on Wednesday where he’s expected to address the future of internet regulations and his vision for revamping the net neutrality rules, Margaret reports. Pai may also circulate a notice of proposed rulemaking on his net neutrality rollback to his fellow commissioners as soon as Thursday, sources tell POLITICO. That would set up a vote on the issue at the FCC's May 18 meeting. Some sources also noted that the coming NPRM could simply propose to get rid of the regulatory classification of broadband providers while seeking comment on ways to preserve the rules. We’ll be tracking Pai’s remarks today at the National Association of Broadcasters conference and tomorrow at an event hosted by FreedomWorks and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council at the Newseum. Watch the NAB speech today at 12 p.m, EST, here. Story Continued Below — Dems gearing up for a fight: Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told Ashley on Monday that Democrats are ready to fight back on any proposed plans to roll back Obama-era net neutrality regulations — and that the FCC should prepare to hear from the public. “[Pai] is going to gut net neutrality and I think he’s making a mistake,” Schatz, a member of the Commerce Committee, said. “When you’re taking something away, people get very, very angry. I anticipate that this is going to be an unprecedented online backlash.” — Pai on Monday also unveiled a federal advisory committee on diversity and digital empowerment that’s intended to nurture diversity within the “communications marketplace.” “The committee could help the FCC promote diversity in the communications industry by assisting in the establishment of an incubator program and could identify ways to combat digital redlining,” Pai said in a statement, which also said the FCC will solicit members once the committee is established.

ADMIN OFFICIALS TO HUDDLE WITH HILL ON TAX REFORM — Trump advisers including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are set to meet with GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) to talk tax reform today, POLITICO’s Brian Faler reports. “Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) are also slated to attend, according to a Ryan spokeswoman.” Trump has said he will share a major announcement on tax reform on Wednesday. TRUMP & TECH: THE 100 DAY CHECK-IN — We’re keeping tabs on what the Trump administration has — and hasn’t — done in the tech and telecom policy arena thus far as the president’s 100th day in office approaches this Saturday. We touched on personnel openings and regulatory rollbacks in yesterday’s MT and are taking a closer look at a few of the job pledges that tech companies have made, along with Trump’s approach to immigration. — Tech job promises: Several tech and telecom giants have been among the companies that Trump has met with and touted as examples of job creators he helped inspire, even though aspects of many of these moves had already been in the works. Charter Communications is among the latest to make an announcement like this following a meeting with Trump. In March, it shared a $25 billion investment plan and re-upped a 20,000-jobs pledge, but analysts who track the company said the spending commitment isn’t any fresher than the jobs promise the company had made last year, Margaret reported. Earlier in the year, Intel also made a commitment to open up a factory in Arizona that would contribute to 10,000 new jobs, a project that it originally started during the Obama administration. At the end of last year, Softbank pledged to create a $50 billion fund to support burgeoning U.S. tech startups, money that's part of a broader effort it had first announced prior to huddling with Trump. — Executive actions on immigration: The announcement of Trump’s first travel ban seemed to serve as a watershed moment for tech companies mobilizing in opposition against one of the new administration’s policies, with many of them taking a strong stand against it. A large number of tech giants have maintained this position and recently signed on to an amicus brief speaking out against the administration’s second iteration of a travel ban. H-1B visas, too, continue to be a major focal point — especially following a recent “Buy American, Hire American” executive order that includes a review of high-skilled immigration programs, which could result in changes to the program that’s popular with tech companies. IP BONANZA — The Senate Judiciary Committee has a hearing this morning on intellectual property that features witnesses from Intel and U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement. — The Institute for Policy Innovation is also holding a World Intellectual Property Day event with remarks from Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley today. And tomorrow, the Copyright Alliance will holds its own gathering including keynotes from Karyn Temple Claggett, the acting register of copyrights, and House IP subcommittee vice-chairman Doug Collins (R-Ill.) SPEAKING OF COPYRIGHT — The back-and-forth on the register of copyrights bill, which would make the position a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed role, continues to heat up. “Despite widespread agreement that the Copyright Office is in need of modernization, the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act fails to make modernization a priority and will do just the opposite,” says Joshua Lamel, the executive director of the Re:Create Coalition, a collective that includes tech groups like CTA. “We urge the House to consider these concerns and oppose the bill.” The American Conservative Union on Monday emphasized the need to pass this legislation to “recognize the contributions of copyright to the economy …. [and ascribe] to the position of register an importance commensurate with the sector it oversees.” SILICON VALLEY MUST-READS — — It’s a bird, it’s a plane: It’s a flying car! Alphabet’s Larry Page seems to be getting one of his long-held goals off the ground, so to speak. Page’s company, Kitty Hawk, shared a video of one of its vehicles on Monday, The Verge reports. — LinkedIn vs. Salesforce: Microsoft intends to mine the troves of data LinkedIn has to take on Salesforce, Reuters reports. Artificial intelligence is expected to play a massive role in this competition as well. — Wikipedia jumps into fake news fight: “Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is launching an online publication with the aim to fight fake news by pairing professional journalists with an army of volunteer community contributors,” The Guardian reports. “Wikitribune plans to pay for the reporters by raising money from a crowdfunding campaign.” OUT AND ABOUT — The Internet Association is hosting a conversation with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) this evening, an event which is also serving as a fundraiser for Wyden. … The ACT | App Association and its fly-in of app execs is meeting with “committee staff, including the HELP Committee to highlight the imperative for comprehensive computer science education across the country, as well as House and Senate Judiciary committees to discuss ICPA and lawful access to data,” according to a spokeswoman. TRANSITIONS — Eric Zulkosky, director of member services and policy adviser for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, is headed to GOP lobbying firm Fierce Government Relations. Zulkosky oversaw Scalise’s telecommunications and technology portfolio for his work on the Energy and Commerce Committee. "From his time as legislative director in my personal office, to his important role in the majority whip office, Eric's talent and hard work have helped him rise through the ranks and develop skills and relationships that will ensure he excels in the next chapter of his career,” Scalise said.

Uber faces EU challenge as well: The firm is arguing that it’s a digital company and not a transportation company, a distinction that means that it would not have to adhere to some of the same laws as transport companies, Reuters reports. Dorsey pressed on diversity: In a Periscope conversation with the cast of upcoming film The Circle, the Twitter founder grappled with questions about diversity in tech, The Verge reports.

Transform's enterprise SaaS platform is the only all-in-one big data analytics platform designed specifically for enterprise revenue acceleration. It features a self-constructing data engine that ingests and models specific threads of data from a customer's internal information systems, online ad systems, and third-party data services. The platform's role-based machine learning BOTS provide insights, predictions and recommendations specific to users with job functions across the overall sales and marketing organization. As a result, Transform's RDP delivers a 10x reduction in the time and cost of legacy enterprise business intelligence implementations and enables businesses to optimize their sales, marketing, advertising, channels, promotions and incentives.  "We believe that businesses should be getting a lot more from the massive investments they make in sales and marketing -- more sustainable and predictable revenue growth. And we believe that data is the key. So, we're changing the game for enterprise business intelligence, proving it doesn't have to take years and cost millions of dollars," Transform's co-founder and CEO, Tom Chiarella said. "Furthermore, we believe that our customers require actions, not simply charts and graphs geared for a few internal analysts and specialists." Two years ago, Transform's R&D group searched for a cloud-native data warehouse technology to underpin its vision for the Revenue Data Platform. Transform wanted to equip customers such as Disney, Intel, Macy's, American Apparel, Verizon and Xerox with timely insights and actionable recommendations to boost revenue growth. The modern cloud data warehouse Transform sought had to bring all revenue-related data into one location so companies could analyze, pinpoint revenue gaps and reposition how they marketed, promoted, priced and sold their products and services. After evaluating a number of cloud database technologies, Transform selected Snowflake for its unique built-for-the-cloud architecture. "Snowflake's decoupling of storage and compute, its truly elastic nature and ability to syndicate data made it an ideal choice," said Murali Krishnan, VP of Technology who joined Transform after 22 years at Microsoft. "Snowflake enables our RDP platform to deliver the best of virtually unlimited scalability, security, real-time performance, and cost-effectiveness for our customers." With Snowflake's exponentially faster performance, ability to run ad hoc reporting, scale seamlessly from 1gb of data to multi-PBs, Transform customers shifted from analytics performed weekly, monthly or quarterly by the IT team, to real-time analytics performed by anyone involved in revenue generation. For example, Transform's major retailer customers moved off their legacy systems to RDP powered by Snowflake. These major brands now have a single source of truth for revenue data, direct from ERP and POS sources, and easily integrated with marketing, sales, product and inventory data. Transform also enables retailers to produce predictive insights to improve in-store conversion, product performance, pricing and promotions ROI, customer support insights and enablement, and market opportunities. For example, Transform can quickly uncover why one retailer's physical store performed significantly better than another. Transform communicates recommended daily actions to store managers to help boost sales based on previous performance, current inventory and evolving customer trends. "Our great aim is not insights or even knowledge, but actions," said Transform co-founder and COO, Randa Minkarah. "We want to empower everyone within the company who has a role in revenue to take action that yields real incremental customers, sales and revenue." Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said Transform is one of many innovative SaaS industry analytics solution providers that has chosen Snowflake. "Transform's innovative application helps enterprises take decisive action to improve their top line, and we're happy to be an integral part of their solution." About Transform Transform Inc. is a Seattle-based company launched in 2014 with the first-of-its-kind, data-driven revenue growth platform for enterprise businesses. Transform's customers gain the ability to predict and optimize all aspects of revenue generation including marketing, sales and product strategies. Transform provides data collection, refinement and analysis that is delivered as visualized recommendations. The result is rapid action to drive top line growth. For more information on Transform, please visit www.transform.co. About Snowflake Snowflake is the only data warehouse built for the cloud.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Fujitsu Offers Unrivaled Mobility With New Superior LIFEBOOK Model SUNNYVALE, Calif., April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- News facts: The lightest-ever Fujitsu notebook, LIFEBOOK U937, offers maximum ultra-mobile portability International edition of flagship LIFEBOOK model weighs just two pounds, yet delivers all-day battery performance plus embedded biometric authentication and full connectivity Fujitsu America, Inc. today introduces its new flagship notebook - Fujitsu Notebook LIFEBOOK® U937 – in North America. With a starting weight under two pounds (1.76 lbs, 799 grams), the lightest ever ultra-mobile model in the Fujitsu line-up joins an exclusive club of sub-1kg 13.3-inch clamshell notebooks that can also provide up to 15.5 hours of battery performance. The LIFEBOOK U937 is no lightweight when it comes to performance, power and connectivity. It features the latest, 7th generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor, solid-state drives, and runs Microsoft Windows® 10 Pro, making it the perfect choice for the busy executive who needs more than a tablet while on the move. With a full-size keyboard, choice of black or red colors, and 13.3-inch FHD display with optional touchscreen, the LIFEBOOK U937 provides the freedom to work anywhere, anytime. Nor is there any compromise on security for the LIFEBOOK U937, with biometric security included as standard, with the choice of either fingerprint reader or palm vein authentication. Further protection comes with an integrated SmartCard reader and enterprise-class TPM 2.0 encryption. A solid magnesium housing ensures the 15.5mm thin LIFEBOOK U937 is tough on the outside, too. In many cases, shorter battery life, lower performance or limited connectivity – for example the necessity of using dongles for external ports – have been the trade-offs for a lightweight notebook. There is no need to make these compromises with the LIFEBOOK U937, with up to 15.5 hours of battery life and boasts a full set of interfaces including full-size LAN and HDMI connector, plus embedded WLAN connectivity and Bluetooth®. For additional convenience, Fujitsu also offers a USB Type-C® port replicator, allowing connection to an external display, mouse, keyboard, and other peripherals. Kevin Wrenn, senior vice president, Fujitsu America, Inc., said: "Previously, CIOs had to balance weight, performance, battery life and security when selecting notebooks for their staff. The new LIFEBOOK U937 was purpose-built to deliver these first-rate features in a 13.3-inch clamshell notebook, so IT executives can deliver powerful notebooks that offer the freedom to work from anywhere, anytime. Weighing in well under two pounds, the new flagship LIFEBOOK model is equipped with best-in-class components and biometric security as a standard, as well as a battery that can easily last throughout standard and extended workdays." Availability The first shipments of LIFEBOOK U937 models are expected in North America on May 16, 2017   Notes to editors Weight varies according to system configuration. Key features of the LIFEBOOK U937 include: 7th generation Intel® Core™ processor Ergonomic anti-glare, 13.3-inch FHD display with an optional touchscreen PCIe interface in order to process data faster Best-in-class connectivity with embedded WLAN, Bluetooth Super secure, biometric authentication with either embedded palm vein technology or fingerprint sensor and Integrated SmartCard reader Up to 15.5 hours battery runtime USB Type-C port replicator facilitates workplace sharing Full-sized interfaces eliminate the need for adapters Solid magnesium housing ensures durability Ultra lightweight, starting from 799g and only 15.5 mm thin Online resources Find out more on our Website: http://www.shopfujitsu.com/view/lifebook-u937-notebook Read the Fujitsu blog: http://blog.ts.fujitsu.com Follow Fujitsu on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/FujitsuAmerica Follow us on LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/fujitsu-america Find Fujitsu on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/Fujitsu Fujitsu pictures and media server: http://mediaportal.ts.fujitsu.com/pages/portal.php For regular news updates, bookmark the Fujitsu newsroom: http://www.fujitsu.com/us/about/resources/news/ About Fujitsu Fujitsu is the leading Japanese information and communication technology (ICT) company, offering a full range of technology products, solutions, and services.

Transform's enterprise SaaS platform is the only all-in-one big data analytics platform designed specifically for enterprise revenue acceleration. It features a self-constructing data engine that ingests and models specific threads of data from a customer's internal information systems, online ad systems, and third-party data services. The platform's role-based machine learning BOTS provide insights, predictions and recommendations specific to users with job functions across the overall sales and marketing organization. As a result, Transform's RDP delivers a 10x reduction in the time and cost of legacy enterprise business intelligence implementations and enables businesses to optimize their sales, marketing, advertising, channels, promotions and incentives.  "We believe that businesses should be getting a lot more from the massive investments they make in sales and marketing -- more sustainable and predictable revenue growth. And we believe that data is the key. So, we're changing the game for enterprise business intelligence, proving it doesn't have to take years and cost millions of dollars," Transform's co-founder and CEO, Tom Chiarella said. "Furthermore, we believe that our customers require actions, not simply charts and graphs geared for a few internal analysts and specialists." Two years ago, Transform's R&D group searched for a cloud-native data warehouse technology to underpin its vision for the Revenue Data Platform. Transform wanted to equip customers such as Disney, Intel, Macy's, American Apparel, Verizon and Xerox with timely insights and actionable recommendations to boost revenue growth. The modern cloud data warehouse Transform sought had to bring all revenue-related data into one location so companies could analyze, pinpoint revenue gaps and reposition how they marketed, promoted, priced and sold their products and services. After evaluating a number of cloud database technologies, Transform selected Snowflake for its unique built-for-the-cloud architecture. "Snowflake's decoupling of storage and compute, its truly elastic nature and ability to syndicate data made it an ideal choice," said Murali Krishnan, VP of Technology who joined Transform after 22 years at Microsoft. "Snowflake enables our RDP platform to deliver the best of virtually unlimited scalability, security, real-time performance, and cost-effectiveness for our customers." With Snowflake's exponentially faster performance, ability to run ad hoc reporting, scale seamlessly from 1gb of data to multi-PBs, Transform customers shifted from analytics performed weekly, monthly or quarterly by the IT team, to real-time analytics performed by anyone involved in revenue generation. For example, Transform's major retailer customers moved off their legacy systems to RDP powered by Snowflake. These major brands now have a single source of truth for revenue data, direct from ERP and POS sources, and easily integrated with marketing, sales, product and inventory data. Transform also enables retailers to produce predictive insights to improve in-store conversion, product performance, pricing and promotions ROI, customer support insights and enablement, and market opportunities. For example, Transform can quickly uncover why one retailer's physical store performed significantly better than another. Transform communicates recommended daily actions to store managers to help boost sales based on previous performance, current inventory and evolving customer trends. "Our great aim is not insights or even knowledge, but actions," said Transform co-founder and COO, Randa Minkarah. "We want to empower everyone within the company who has a role in revenue to take action that yields real incremental customers, sales and revenue." Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said Transform is one of many innovative SaaS industry analytics solution providers that has chosen Snowflake. "Transform's innovative application helps enterprises take decisive action to improve their top line, and we're happy to be an integral part of their solution." About Transform Transform Inc. is a Seattle-based company launched in 2014 with the first-of-its-kind, data-driven revenue growth platform for enterprise businesses. Transform's customers gain the ability to predict and optimize all aspects of revenue generation including marketing, sales and product strategies. Transform provides data collection, refinement and analysis that is delivered as visualized recommendations. The result is rapid action to drive top line growth. For more information on Transform, please visit www.transform.co. About Snowflake Snowflake is the only data warehouse built for the cloud.

Senate Republican and Democratic leaders hold their weekly press conferences around 2 p.m. The House is back with first votes at 6:30 p.m. OVER BEFORE IT STARTED? President Trump said Monday he’s open to pushing a fight over border wall funding to September, seemingly removing the biggest obstacle to averting a government shutdown this week. The news is welcome to Republicans, who were facing the dilemma of crossing the president by ignoring his demands or joining with him and inviting a shutdown. Congress is expected to pass a short-term extension later this week to give lawmakers time to wrap up negotiations on a bigger deal. Burgess with the latest: http://politi.co/2q9RhwG RYAN IN THE HOT SEAT — House Speaker Paul Ryan is coming off the two-week recess with major pressure to help deliver Trump a legislative win. Yet Ryan, who is juggling government funding negotiations and pressure from the White House to vote on an Obamacare repeal, is dealing with a novice president unschooled about how Congress actually works and a divided conference that is resisting pressure to compromise on health care. Example du jour: The White House didn’t give the speaker’s office so much as a heads up before it started whispering last week about the potential for a House vote on the Obamacare repeal this week. The move left House leaders scrambling to tamp down expectations and walk back what the White House was saying. “You do hear: ‘Is Paul Ryan the right person to lead the conference?’” said one senior House Republican. “But we’re still in the same place we were a year and a half ago. Who would lead the conference? He’s the best person to lead the conference, and there isn’t a close second.” Rachael and Bres: http://politi.co/2qa2qxz COMING ATTRACTIONS — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and NEC Director Gary Cohn will be on the Hill today meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and chairmen of the tax-writing committees on Trump’s tax plan, coming tomorrow. You wanna do what? The president’s plan will propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, a move that already has deficit-minded Republicans up in arms and would likely run afoul of Senate budgetary rules, meaning he’d need Democratic buy-in to see such an idea enacted. The Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin: http://on.wsj.com/2q9IqeD STARTING YOUR TUESDAY OFF RIGHT. Welcome to April 25 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. MONDAY’S MOST CLICKED: Rachael, Kyle and Burgess’ story about the shutdown fight over the border wall. 100 DAY READ — Gabriel Debenedetti on how Trump's first 100 days have helped Democrats channel their rage and resuscitate the party while still obscuring the same problems: http://politi.co/2p0tPnG MUM GOES THE MODERATE — Conservative hardliners seem to be falling in line behind the latest GOP compromise to repeal Obamacare. But many moderates, whose support is also essential to the bill’s passage, are unmoved. "This amendment doesn't do anything to change my position on the health care bill," said Tuesday Group co-chair Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). His comment is telling because fellow Tuesday Group leader Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) is the one working with the Freedom Caucus to broker a deal. Jen Haberkorn, Josh Dawsey and Adam Cancryn with more: http://politi.co/2q9Q7kU HAPPENING TODAY — Lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee will be viewing classified documents from the Department of Defense related to former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The request came after news last month that Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did for the Turkish government during the campaign. BRIEFING BRIEF — On Friday, some Democrats’ eyes rolled when they received new guidance from the White House redirecting Wednesday’s North Korea briefing from the Senate to the White House itself. They could not understand why the briefing would move from a room specifically built for such briefings, a SCIF, to a White House auditorium. ** A message from ZERO TO THREE: It’s time to Think Babies. Hey Congress: We’re coming to your crib! Babies and parents from every state are coming to Capitol Hill to see you – and to bring national attention to what babies and families need to thrive. Meet the babies May 2 at 12:00pm, Upper Senate Park. http://bit.ly/2mrnlvh ** So what happened? An administration official explained that President Donald Trump offered the venue to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a “gesture” but said the decision was left to McConnell. "The president offered to host the meeting and the majority leader agreed,” McConnell spokesman David Popp told Huddle. But Democrats don’t buy it: They think the venue was changed for better optics for Trump. GET ON WITH IT, DEMS SAY — Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee are publicly expressing their frustrations with what they say are unnecessary efforts by Republicans on the panel to slow down the investigation into Russia. The committee has yet to issue a single subpoena for documents, key witnesses or request crucial records from the Trump campaign despite a push from Democrats to do so, Michael Isikoff reports for Yahoo News. Fact du jour: Only seven part-time staffers are working on the Senate Intel’s Russia probe. By comparison, the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks had 46 staffers. Reuters Dustin Volz: http://reut.rs/2pvrClW The pace has Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the panel's top Democrat, “very frustrated” according to CNN. And Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has feuded with Senate Intel Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) about which staffers get to view intelligence related to the probe, told Manu Raju he has “serious concerns.” It’s time to start following “the money, following the trail of the dead bodies,” Wyden said.

Jones previously worked as senior counsel to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and senior Democratic counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. One startling fact: Of the roughly 340 top Senate staffers, only six are African American, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in a release announcing Jones’ move. Bret Manley, legislative director for Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), starts a new gig May 1 as assistant vice president of government affairs for the Association of American Railroads.

Picking a processor for a gaming PC is a long-term decision. The processor decides how powerful your PC is overall and can make a big difference in frame rates when gaming, even if you have the best graphics card. In this group test, we evaluate three of Intel’s latest processors and four of AMD’s new Ryzen chips to see which deserves a place in your next rig. A quick guide to CPUs If a chip has more cores, it’s going to be better with multi-tasking and demanding software that utilises more ‘threads’ when going about its business. However, the latest games don’t tend to benefit much from having more than four threads, but having fewer than four could see you seeing some serious bottlenecking in more complex titles such as Battlefield 1. Meanwhile, a higher clock speed (measured in GHz) will make single-threaded software feel snappier and most games perform better. Those are the two key factors, but there’s plenty more to consider. Price is important too because it’s no good wasting money on a chip that’s overpowered. Related: A beginner’s guide to CPUs Look at chipsets, too, because these determine the features on your motherboard. High-end chipsets will support multiple graphics cards, numerous USB ports and better storage hardware, whereas more affordable chipsets and their corresponding motherboards will be more restrictive. That’s fine if you’re only building a modest gaming rig, but no good if you want to use numerous peripherals, several hard disks and expand the machine in the future. For example, if you want to overclock your 7th-gen Intel processor, you’ll need a motherboard using either the Z170 or Z270 chipset. Otherwise you’re wasting its potential. Related: Best gaming PC builds from £500/$500 How we test We have two test benches, one for AMD and one for Intel. The minor differences in cooler and SSD should make minimal differences to performance, but as with all benchmarking, there is a small margin of error that we take into account in our conclusions. Intel test machine Asus Strix Z270H Gaming motherboard 16GB Corsair Vengeance 3000MHz DDR4 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Intel 600p SSD Corsair Hydro H100i V2 cooler AMD test machine Gigabyte AX370-Gaming 5 16GB Corsair Vengeance 3000MHz DDR4 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung 960 Evo SSD Noctua NH-U12S cooler We used the following benchmarks: Cinebench - this popular CPU benchmark tests single- and multi-threaded performance by rendering a 3D scene purely using CPU power. It's comparable across both Intel and AMD platforms, which makes it perfect for processor comparisons and for determining which chips are better with single-threaded tasks and which are better for more intensive workloads. POVRay - this is a ray-tracing test that renders a complex graphical scene using a CPU's various cores and threads. That makes it an ideal test for heavy workloads - and, therefore, perfect for high-end processors. Handbrake - this is a video transcoding test that represents one of the toughest tasks that most home users will require from their PCs. It uses every core available on a CPU, too, so it's an important test for multi-threaded performance. PC Mark 8 - this is a popular, multi-platform tests that runs an entire PC through a range of common tasks, so it's a great measure of baseline performance in several different scenarios. Power tests - we test entire machines at idle and peak loads to determine which processors require the most electricity. Heat tests - in a similar vein, we also measure the temperatures produced by processors. These can be drastically altered by the cooling used in a PC, but it's still important to know how much heat a chip will generate - and therefore what kind of cooling it'll need in a home PC. The Witcher 3 - this is one of the world's most popular single-player games, and it's graphically demanding but light on the CPU - it has a minimal processing workload and only uses a single core. That makes it representative of most games on the market, which makes it reliable for benchmarking. Battlefield 1 - this complex first-person shooter is a game where the best players use lighting speed to win matches, so it's important to find out whether a CPU is going to bottleneck the title and reduce its performance levels. It's more demanding of processors, too, thanks to a larger number of human or AI opponents. Ashes of the Singularity - this is the most CPU-intensive title we test, and that's no surprise - this RTS renders hundreds of characters at once, which puts enormous strain on a processor. It's got a conventional benchmark, and it also predicts a maximum CPU framerate if the GPU wasn't a factor in the test. NOTE: Our testing of Ashes took place before the game's developers released a Ryzen optimsation patch, which will substantially improve AMD's results in these tests. As soon as we're able to update our numbers, we will.Scroll to the very bottom of this page for performance graphs. 1 / 8 Intel Celeron G3950 Key features: Two cores, two threads 3GHz clock speed 51W TDP No overclocking Intel LGA 1151 socket Cooler included Review price: £53 Supplied by Overclockers UK The budget processor for eSports The Celeron G3950’s key attribute isn’t anything to do with Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture – it’s the £54 price. That makes it the cheapest chip in this group and a compelling choice for a budget rig for eSports and low-end gaming. The chip is compatible with Intel's latest B250 or Z270 motherboards, but it'll only work on Skylake H110, B150, H170 and Z170 boards after a BIOS update, which requires a Skylake processor to be fitted. In other words, pick your motherboard carefully. The budget price does mean a reduced specification. This dual-core chip doesn't have Hyper-Threading and its 3GHz frequency is as far as it'll go. It’s not unlocked, it has less cache than its pricier peers, and memory support tops out at 2,400MHz DDR4. It’s no good for multi-tasking, but some of its benchmark results are surprisingly decent. Its 122cb result in Cinebench’s single-threaded test is within touching distance of some AMD parts, and its single-core POVRay result of 311 points is only four points behind the Ryzen 7 1700. The Celeron’s single-threaded performance lends itself to less intensive gaming. Our Celeron-powered rig played Witcher 3’s 1080p test at 61fps with medium graphics settings, and it ran Battlefield 1 at 32fps with the same options. The Battlefield results is disappointing but not surprising: the game's minimum system specs dictate a quad-core processor. Still, this chip will be great for titles like DOTA 2, League of Legends and CS:GO which use a single CPU core and don’t require as much pure speed. The CPU peaked at 39°C and the PC only draw 67W from the mains, too, which means it’s easier to build this chip into a smaller, quieter case – ideal for carrying to esports events. The Celeron G3950 will balk at demanding games and huge resolutions, but don’t discount this chip if you’re into esports – it’s dirt cheap and it’ll handle those low-end games with room to spare. 2 / 8 Intel Core i3-7350K Key features: Two cores, four threads 4.2GHz clock speed 60W TDP Unlocked multiplier Intel LGA 1151 socket No cooler supplied Review price: £169 Supplied by Overclockers UK A expensive dual-core chip for overclocking enthusiasts The Core i3-3750K might cost just £170, but it doesn’t make a huge amount of sense to use this affordable part in a gaming PC. For starters, it’s Kaby Lake, so it benefits from an improved 14nm manufacturing process, better speeds, higher Turbo frequencies and a new graphics architecture, although the latter in this case is irrelevant because our tests use a dedicated graphics card. Its two cores have Hyper-Threading, making for four threads, and it runs at 4.2GHz. That’s one of the highest speeds of any Kaby Lake chip, which makes up for the absence of Turbo Boost. This means it’s going to be super-snappy in desktop tasks, but might fall behind in intensive, multi-threaded workloads. This chip faces a stern test from the new AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (see #2), which has double the cores but a slower clock speed. The Core i3’s Witcher 3 average of 49.8fps was more than 10fps behind the 1500X, Intel’s chip was 7fps behind in Ashes of the Singularity and 2fps back in Battlefield 1. The 7350K returned mixed results in application tests: its better speed saw its single-core test results outpace AMD, but it fell miles behind in multi-threaded tests, as you’d expect given the difference in core count. There’s one area where the i3-7350K really excels. This is the only sub-£200 Intel chip with an unlocked multiplier, which means it can be overclocked to around 5GHz. That’s impressive, but it’ll only deliver big improvements in single-threaded applications and some games The i3-7350K is great for cheap overclocking, and its single-threaded pace sees it beat the 1500X. On the Intel side of things, it’s one of the cheapest ways to get into overclocking, so enthusiasts will have bags of fun. But you’ll need a pricier Z170 or Z270 motherboard to actually benefit from it, so the cost savings on the chip side are cancelled out by the more expensive motherboards. For most people, it’s not the sensible choice, even if it really tickles our love of overclocking. A more sensible choice would be the Intel Core i3-7100, which clocks in at 3.8GHz, has two cores with Hyper-Threading and costs substantially less at just £116. 3 / 8 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Key features: Four cores, eight threads 3.5GHz base clock speed, 3.7GHz boost 65W TDP XFR-enabled AMD AMD4 socket Wraith Spire cooler supplied Review price: £189 The best gaming CPU under £200The 1500X is the most affordable Ryzen chip, but that doesn’t mean it’s weak. It has four hyper-threaded cores (equating to eight threads) clocked to 3.5GHz, and the X suffix means it benefits from Extended Frequency Range, which gives it higher boosting capabilities than vanilla Ryzen chips. This £189 chip competes well with Intel. Its nearest competition is the £180 Core i3-7350K, which has a better raw speed of 4.2GHz but half the threads. Ryzen’s newer architecture and improved core count helped it excel in gaming tests. Its 61.1fps average in Witcher 3’s 1440p Ultra test was better than every Intel chip we’ve tested, and it was almost as impressive in Battlefield 1 – its 83.3fps average was only a couple of fps behind far pricier Intel parts. The 1500X scored 47.8fps in the CPU-intensive Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. That’s still better than most Intel chips – and even a frame or two ahead of more expensive Ryzen chips. The 1500X is a rock-solid gaming chip, but it returned mixed results in application tests. The Core i3 is significantly quicker in single-core tests, but the 1500X is faster in multi-core benchmarks – no surprise given it has double the cores. If you need a CPU for multi-tasking, though, other Ryzen processors have even more cores. Its 100W power consumption is a tad higher than Intel, and it’s not as good at overclocking – we were only able to nab another 0.2GHz out of it in our tests, which didn’t really seem worth the effort or increased power consumption and heat. Those are minor issues, though, which pale in comparison with the 1500X’s upsides. It’s quicker than its Core i3 rival in games tests, and it’s better in multi-threaded applications, too – the Core i3 chip is only faster in single-threaded benchmarks. The 1500X  is versatile and just as affordable, so it’s a top-notch choice. Read our full AMD Ryzen 5 review 4 / 8 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Key features: Six cores, 12 threads 3.6GHz base clock speed, 4GHz Turbo 95W TDP XFR-enabled AMD AM4 socket No cooler supplied Review price: £249 A six-core i5 alternativeThe £249 Ryzen 5 1600X challenges the £225 Core i5-7600K (see #4)  – a popular mid-range chip. The AMD chip’s six hyper-threaded cores beat the Intel CPU, which has four cores and no hyper-threading, but the Core i5 fights back with a 3.8GHz base speed that’s 200MHz faster than the 1600X, and will go well beyond when overclocked. That makes an interesting battle: AMD should succeed in multi-threaded tests, but it’ll be weaker in single-threaded applications. The 1600X’s single-core Cinebench and POVRay results of 161cb and 383 are slower than the 181cb and 444 scored by the Core i5. The tables were turned in multi-threaded tasks: the AMD chip’s multi-core Cinebench pace of 1,240cb was around twice as quick as the Core i5 – and even better than the Core i7-7700K. The 1600X’s 60.8fps average in Witcher 3 was around ten frames better than every Intel chip, and its 82.2fps pace in Battlefield 1 was nine frames quicker than the i5-7600K. AMD’s hardware was slower in Ashes of the Singularity, though. The 1600X’s power consumption of 137W is higher than Intel chips, which will make a difference in compact PC builds. It’s a little behind Intel when overclocking, too; we improved the chip to 4GHz, but that’s no better than its boost clock. The Core i5 can achieve bigger tweaks that deliver better gains. Our tests on both chips were conducted at stock speeds. Despite that, the 1600X is excellent. Its six-core design performs well in games and dominates multi-threaded tasks. Its single-core pace is less impressive, which is worth bearing in mind if you play older games that benefit more from faster clock speeds. It’s neck-and-neck between the 1600X and the 7600K (below); the 7600K is a better overclocker so should manage much better gaming performance if you put in the effort and buy a Z170 or Z270 motherboard. Without any messing around, though, the excellent six-core 1600X is very impressive. Read our full AMD Ryzen 5 review 5 / 8 Intel Core i5-7600K Key features: Four cores, four threads 3.8GHz base clock, 4.2GHz boost 91W TDP Unlocked multiplier Intel LGA 1151 socket No cooler supplied Review price: £225 Supplied by Overclockers UK The best gaming CPU for overclocking Intel’s mid-range chips have long been a favourite for gaming systems and for good reason. They offer ample power for ploughing through the latest titles but don;t come with the high-end excesses saved for more expensive silicon. The Core i5-7600K is a quad-core part that runs at 3.8GHz with a Turbo peak of 4.2GHz. It doesn’t have quite as much cache as a Core i7 chip and it doesn’t have Hyper-Threading, so the four cores you see is exactly what you get. There’s a new player in town, though: the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, outlined above. The Core i5’s rapid clocks mean it’s a barnstormer in single-threaded tasks: its 181cb Cinebench single-core score is better than every Ryzen chip and will make a difference when you’re not playing games; editing photos and loading up web pages will definitely benefit. As you can see from the 1600X’s entry, the 7600K naturally fell quite some way behind the 1600X in multi-threaded multimedia benchmarks. But this test is about gaming. Its 49.3fps Witcher 3 average is behind the 60.8fps scored by Ryzen, and the results were similar in Battlefield 1 and Ashes of the Singularity. The i5-7600K isn’t slow and it’s not going to cause any bottlenecking issues, but the AMD 1600X appears to be faster in our tests at stock speeds. The big thing here is that the Core i5 chip can overclock higher than its AMD rival and consumes less power, which will make a difference in more compact PC builds where heat is an issue. This is far from a knockout for AMD, and Intel fans can take stock that Team Blue still has its own advantages. If you don't want to overclock and prefer to stick with Intel, the 3.5GHz Intel Core i5-7400 is a decent option, with four cores and a £180 price tag. 6 / 8 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Key features: Eight cores, 16 threads 3GHz base clock speed, 3.7GHz Turbo 65W TDP No XFR AMD AM4 platform Wraith Spire LED cooler supplied The cheapest eight-core processor The Ryzen 7 1700 is the cheapest eight-core processor on the market – there’s nowhere else to get support for sixteen threads for £300. Elsewhere, the 1700 has a fairly mediocre clock speed of 3GHz with a boost peak of 3.7GHz, and it has many familiar attributes of Zen: the 14nm manufacturing process, the large caches and the improved hyper-threading and boosting. It’s also missing the X suffix found on other Ryzen chips. That means the 1700 isn’t able to boost as much as other AMD chips – it can improve the speed of a core by 50MHz, but X-branded chips can add 100MHz. That restricts performance, but it brings the TDP down to 65W – far lower than full-fat Ryzen and Intel parts. This £300 AMD chip sidles up against Intel’s Core i7-7700K, which costs £330 (below). The Intel part has four hyper-threaded cores, so it falls behind in that department, but its 4.2GHz clock speeds is far better and should give it an advantage in the gaming tests. The Ryzen 1700 led the way in Witcher 3 with a 10fps advantage over Intel at 1440p, but in Battlefield 1 its average of 82.2fps was 5fps behind the Core i7-7700K. AMD was further behind in Ashes of the Singularity, which is sensitive to single-core clock speed: Ryzen averaged 67.6fps, but the Core i7-7700K neared 100fps. AMD’s chip was behind in single-threaded benchmarks too. Its 134cb Cinebench result was miles behind the Core i7-7700K’s 193cb result, and it was around 500 points slower in PC Mark 8. Ryzen succeeded in multi-threaded tests. Its POVray multi-threaded result of 2,897 easily beat the 2,119 scored by the Core i7, and its 81s Handbrake transcoding pace was fifteen seconds better than Intel. The 1700’s results make it difficult to recommend as a pure gamer’s chip. Its six-core design means it’s the obvious choice if you need to run multi-threaded applications, but the quad-core Intel is no slouch – and the i7-7700K is better in games and single-threaded tests. For pure gaming, the 7700K is the better bet. Read our full AMD Ryzen 7 1700 review 7 / 8 Intel Core i7-7700K Key features: Four cores, eight threads 4.2GHz base clock, 4.5GHz Turbo 91W TDP Unlocked multiplier Intel LGA 1151 socket No cooler supplied Review price: £330 The fastest gaming CPU Intel’s top consumer processor costs £330, and you get an awful lot for that cash: its stock and boost speeds of 4.2GHz and 4.5GHz are unrivalled, and its four cores are hyper-threaded. It’s got more cache than other Intel chips, and its 14nm manufacturing process keeps the power consumption below many AMD parts. That would ordinarily make the i7-7700K a top buy, but Ryzen has muddied the waters. Specifically, the Ryzen 7 1700 outlined above. Intel faces a challenge, but benchmarks reveal that the i7-7700K is ready for battle – especially in gaming tests and single-threaded applications. The i7-7700K’s Witcher 3 result of 50fps is behind Ryzen, but Intel fought back with a nine-frame lead in Battlefield 1 – and it then outpaced the 1700 by around 40fps in the CPU-intensive Ashes of the Singularity test. The 7700K’s good performance continued to single-threaded tests: its 472-point result in POVRay was easily ahead of the Ryzen chip’s 315-point result, and it was nearly 60 points better in Cinebench. The Core i7 proved itself a better overclocker than its competition from AMD, too, and its power consumption wasn’t much higher than the Ryzen 7 1700.   The only area where the Core i7-7700K fell behind was in multi-threaded benchmarks, where the Ryzen chip’s eight cores delivered a comprehensive victory. The Core i7 is hardly slow, though, and it will be quicker in most games. If you want to build a high-end gaming rig, the Core i7-7700K is still the chip to choose. Read our full Intel Core i7-7700K review 8 / 8 AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Key features: Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base speed, 4GHz Turbo XFR-enabled 95W TDP AMD AM4 socket No cooler supplied Review price: £500 The best CPU for streamersIntel had spent years without competition at the top of the CPU market, but AMD’s new architecture has blown away the blue team with a multi-threaded attack led by the £500 Ryzen 7 1800X. AMD’s new flagship has a fearsome specification. It’s clocked to 3.6GHz with a 4GHz Turbo speed. It has the numerous benefits of Zen, like a new manufacturing process, better boosting and smarter task delegation. This chip occupies an interesting spot in the market. Its £500 price is high compared to the Core i7-7700K – a chip that has half the number of cores but a far higher speed of 4.2GHz. That part costs a relatively affordable £330. To get similar Intel technology, you’ll need to spend more than £1,000 on the i7-6900K. The new architecture and eight-core design helped the 1800X excel in multi-threaded tests. Its Cinebench score of 1,615cb is almost twice as good as the 7700K, and it was more than 1,000 points ahead in POVRay. It took 70s to transcode our test video – 26s quicker than the i7-7700K. It even beat the i7-6900K in those tests. The 1800X’s slower speed and higher core count returned mixed pace in games tests. Its 62.1fps result in Witcher 3 beat the i7-7700K but couldn’t outpace the pricier Intel 6900K (which we’ve not included here due to its price), and the 1800X was marginally slower than both Intel processors in Battlefield 1. There was little to choose between the three parts in the CPU-intensive Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. The 1800X’s weakest performance came in single-threaded tests, where it regularly beat the i7-6900K but fell behind the i7-7700K. That’s no surprise, as the quad-core Intel chip has everything beat on raw speed. The 1800 X is better than both rivals in multi-tasking, and it’s great in games, too – either on par with Intel or faster. Its weakest performance comes in single-threaded tests, but it’s hardly slow. If you want to build a high-end gaming PC and fancy yourself as a game streamer, this is a superb choice. With loads of cores available for video encoding and gaming simultaneously, it’s an excellent option. It’s pricier than the Core i7-7700K, sure, but you get extra versatility from those extra cores alongside top-notch speeds in many tests. When its price is considered, the 1800X is the best high-performance processor on the market right now. Read our full AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review Summary You've read our reviews, now take a look at our data yourselves. We've included all our gaming benchmarks and a couple of non-gaming tests as well. Battlefield 1 (average fps) The Witcher 3 (average fps) Ashes of the Singularity (average fps) NOTE: Our testing of Ashes took place before the game's developers released a Ryzen optimsation patch, which will substantially improve AMD's results in these tests. As soon as we're able to update our numbers, we will.

So it’s refreshing when they come out with the rare critical look at the stock market and suggest stocks you might want to avoid. Credit Suisse takes a stab at this every quarter in a report that will delight any contrarian. The bank highlights “crowded trades,” or companies that are so favored by mutual fund managers and Wall Street analysts that they look like trouble. These quarterly reports, called “The Darlings of Active Managers” and “Carving Up the Consensus,” aren’t predictions that overcrowded sectors and stocks are about to crash. Instead, they’re names and groups that are more vulnerable to weakness because everyone loves them. The logic here is twofold. First, if everyone loves these stocks, who is left to buy them? And if they are priced to perfection, then just a little bad news might get a stampede going. Selling can beget selling, as the herd heads for the exits. Do you have what it takes to launch a successful startup?(2:00) David Jegen of F-Prime Capital, the venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments, talks to MarketWatch about what young entrepreneurs can do to secure funding for their startup. Credit Suisse says its research has a decent record of predicting underperformance, and it works best on crowded trades in the large-cap and growth categories. Who doesn’t like a winner? Since bullish crowds push stocks higher and this draws in even more investors who want to run with the bulls, it’s no surprise that the most crowded trades are usually the stocks that have performed the best. “The bias is that the recent past will repeat itself near term,” says Eric Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management. But the problem is that most of the potential profits have already been made in darling stocks, since they turn into crowded trades. “The best company in the world isn’t a great investment if everyone thinks it is the best company in the world,” says Marshall. Instead, stocks that offer the greatest opportunities are the ones that no one is talking about, he says. That’s how contrarians think. But people, being people, they often love to be with the crowd. So they pile into popular trades even if it’s not the best way to make money. Here are some of the most popular sectors and stocks today, according to Credit Suisse, which you may want to think twice about owning. “We recommend against owning too many of these names,” says Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina. Chips Investors are enthralled with semiconductor companies for two main reasons, says Heartland Advisors portfolio manager Colin McWey. One is the belief that wickedly volatile sales and inventory cycles have miraculously smoothed out. The other is a spate of mergers and acquisitions. This M&A is supposedly a plus because of “synergies,” cost cutting and cross-selling opportunities they bring. “It seems like folks have really gotten behind the consolidation,” says McWey. Buy-side bullishness is already a problem, but there’s more to the story. Sentiment is actually beginning to slip among portfolio managers. This could auger the beginning of a downtrend. “All of our buy-side indicators have plenty of room to retreat before reaching oversold conditions,” says Calvasina. There are more troubling signs on the sell side, because Wall Street analysts are on board in a big way. They have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings on chip stocks in years. “This indicator may be ripe for reversion,” says Calvasina. What might amp up the negativity among investors? Any sign that swings in demand and inventories are not really a thing of the past would be a big problem. This really shouldn’t be a surprise if it happens. This is the future of 3-D printing(2:19) Max Friefeld, CEO of Voodoo Manufacturing, the nation's first robot-operated 3-D printing hub, talks to MarketWatch about how 3-D printing can revolutionize mass manufacturing. “Ultimately these are still very cyclical businesses,” says McWey. Next, negativity could develop if investors see signs that the hoped-for gains from mergers aren’t panning out. This could easily happen too. “Historically, companies have a mixed track record with M&A,” says McWey. Credit Suisse says particularly crowded trades include Intel INTC, +0.33% Qualcomm QCOM, +0.36% MKS Instruments MKSI, +1.71% Microsemi MSCC, +0.44% Monolithic Power Systems MPWR, +1.01% and Lam Research LRCX, +2.28% Software services In a world short on growth, investors have crowded into the few sectors that display any. Companies that offer software and software-related services fit the bill. “These stocks have been priced to perfection because of their above-average growth in the past five years,” says Marshall, at Hodges Capital Management. “This is an area where we are underweight. We have a hard time getting comfortable with the valuations.” Alarmingly, both hedge-fund ownership and bullish sell-side ratings have reached historical highs, says Credit Suisse. To help justify bullish ratings, sell-side analysts have resorted to an old trick from the tech-bubble era. They’re valuing companies on the basis of price-to-sales. This can be a useful measure for young companies that have minimal earnings, because scant earnings make price-to-earnings multiples meaninglessly high. “But it’s less appropriate for mature companies because you can’t use sales to pay dividends, buy back stock or make investments,” says Marshall. For that, you need earnings. The use of less conventional valuation tools like price-to-sales to rationalize bullish ratings works, until it doesn’t. “When something goes wrong, it’s kind of hard to find a floor because there’s no earnings or free cash flow floor underneath to support valuations,” says McWey. “And you never know when the rug is going to get pulled.” On the flip side, because valuations are high, it’s not easy to justify owning those stocks. “It’s really hard to see how these companies can be valued much higher than they are today,” says Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Frank Capital Partners, who sold his position in Microsoft MSFT, +0.58% in the fourth quarter. “I don’t think Microsoft is going to have a disaster. It’s a really great company. But it is fully valued.” However, many less substantial tech companies are so priced to perfection that “any little disappointment could result in significant downside,” he cautions. Credit Suisse cites Microsoft as a crowded trade. It is an overweight position in nearly half of S&P 500 benchmarked funds. Others include: Alphabet GOOG, +1.11% Facebook FB, +0.70% Salesforce.com CRM, +0.69% Adobe ADBE, +0.45% Vantiv VNTV, -0.17% Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO, +0.13% Electronic Arts EA, +0.19% Fiserv FISV, +0.15% ServiceNow NOW, +0.92% Guidewire Software GWRE, +1.40% CoStar CSGP, -0.47% Proofpoint PFPT, +0.21% Fidelity National Information Services FIS, +0.65% and Red Hat RHT, +0.17% Netflix NFLX, +5.79% arguably a software-services company, is the only FANG stock (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) that doesn’t appear on the overcrowded trade list. Technology hardware In a sluggish economy, investors have crowded into tech-hardware companies because they are among the few with decent growth. Here are some warning signs from Credit Suisse on this group that should grab your attention. The share of bullish sell-side ratings is at the highest level in over 15 years. Hedge-fund ownership is at all-time highs. And mutual fund exposure has been rising. Tech-hardware companies that look like crowded trades include Apple AAPL, +0.62% Cisco CSCO, +0.42% Western Digital WDC, +1.29% and Amphenol APH, +0.35% Consumer staples In a world of lousy returns from bonds because interest rates are so low, investors have turned to the stock market for bond substitutes. They’ve found them in consumer-staples companies that pay decent dividends and offer the potential for capital appreciation. The problem here is investors have driven these shares to valuations that are too high, given their relatively meager sales and earnings growth potential. “I sincerely doubt they will be able to grow earnings in alignment with their P/E ratios,” says McWey. But that’s not the only issue. Blinded by their love of dividends, investors have taken their eyes off potential risks. Competition in the grocery arena is fierce. A company like PepsiCo PEP, -0.14% can get hit by changes in consumer tastes. And input costs could go up a lot, crimping margins. “Add that into a very combustible mix of high valuations, and you could see significant declines even without a recession or a decrease in revenue growth,” says Frank, at Frank Capital Partners. Despite these risks, the number of mutual funds overweight in large-cap companies in food and staples retailing was recently hitting new highs, says Credit Suisse. The percentage of sell-side analysts with bullish ratings was also near highs for the past 15 years. Besides Pepsi, consumer-staples companies that look like crowded trades include Newell Brands ( NWL, +1.08% CVS Health CVS, +2.65% and Costco Wholesale COST, +0.20% Enjoy their products if you want. But be careful with their stocks, particularly if you’re thinking they might serve as a defense for your portfolio in a selloff. They probably won’t, especially if that selloff is sparked by rising interest rates, a likely scenario, because this hurts bonds and bond proxies like consumer-staples stocks.

So it’s refreshing when they come out with the rare critical look at the stock market and suggest stocks you might want to avoid. Credit Suisse takes a stab at this every quarter in a report that will delight any contrarian. The bank highlights “crowded trades,” or companies that are so favored by mutual fund managers and Wall Street analysts that they look like trouble. These quarterly reports, called “The Darlings of Active Managers” and “Carving Up the Consensus,” aren’t predictions that overcrowded sectors and stocks are about to crash. Instead, they’re names and groups that are more vulnerable to weakness because everyone loves them. The logic here is twofold. First, if everyone loves these stocks, who is left to buy them? And if they are priced to perfection, then just a little bad news might get a stampede going. Selling can beget selling, as the herd heads for the exits. Do you have what it takes to launch a successful startup?(2:00) David Jegen of F-Prime Capital, the venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments, talks to MarketWatch about what young entrepreneurs can do to secure funding for their startup. Credit Suisse says its research has a decent record of predicting underperformance, and it works best on crowded trades in the large-cap and growth categories. Who doesn’t like a winner? Since bullish crowds push stocks higher and this draws in even more investors who want to run with the bulls, it’s no surprise that the most crowded trades are usually the stocks that have performed the best. “The bias is that the recent past will repeat itself near term,” says Eric Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management. But the problem is that most of the potential profits have already been made in darling stocks, since they turn into crowded trades. “The best company in the world isn’t a great investment if everyone thinks it is the best company in the world,” says Marshall. Instead, stocks that offer the greatest opportunities are the ones that no one is talking about, he says. That’s how contrarians think. But people, being people, they often love to be with the crowd. So they pile into popular trades even if it’s not the best way to make money. Here are some of the most popular sectors and stocks today, according to Credit Suisse, which you may want to think twice about owning. “We recommend against owning too many of these names,” says Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina. Chips Investors are enthralled with semiconductor companies for two main reasons, says Heartland Advisors portfolio manager Colin McWey. One is the belief that wickedly volatile sales and inventory cycles have miraculously smoothed out. The other is a spate of mergers and acquisitions. This M&A is supposedly a plus because of “synergies,” cost cutting and cross-selling opportunities they bring. “It seems like folks have really gotten behind the consolidation,” says McWey. Buy-side bullishness is already a problem, but there’s more to the story. Sentiment is actually beginning to slip among portfolio managers. This could auger the beginning of a downtrend. “All of our buy-side indicators have plenty of room to retreat before reaching oversold conditions,” says Calvasina. There are more troubling signs on the sell side, because Wall Street analysts are on board in a big way. They have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings on chip stocks in years. “This indicator may be ripe for reversion,” says Calvasina. What might amp up the negativity among investors? Any sign that swings in demand and inventories are not really a thing of the past would be a big problem. This really shouldn’t be a surprise if it happens. This is the future of 3-D printing(2:19) Max Friefeld, CEO of Voodoo Manufacturing, the nation's first robot-operated 3-D printing hub, talks to MarketWatch about how 3-D printing can revolutionize mass manufacturing. “Ultimately these are still very cyclical businesses,” says McWey. Next, negativity could develop if investors see signs that the hoped-for gains from mergers aren’t panning out. This could easily happen too. “Historically, companies have a mixed track record with M&A,” says McWey. Credit Suisse says particularly crowded trades include Intel INTC, +0.33% Qualcomm QCOM, +0.36% MKS Instruments MKSI, +1.71% Microsemi MSCC, +0.44% Monolithic Power Systems MPWR, +1.01% and Lam Research LRCX, +2.28% Software services In a world short on growth, investors have crowded into the few sectors that display any. Companies that offer software and software-related services fit the bill. “These stocks have been priced to perfection because of their above-average growth in the past five years,” says Marshall, at Hodges Capital Management. “This is an area where we are underweight. We have a hard time getting comfortable with the valuations.” Alarmingly, both hedge-fund ownership and bullish sell-side ratings have reached historical highs, says Credit Suisse. To help justify bullish ratings, sell-side analysts have resorted to an old trick from the tech-bubble era. They’re valuing companies on the basis of price-to-sales. This can be a useful measure for young companies that have minimal earnings, because scant earnings make price-to-earnings multiples meaninglessly high. “But it’s less appropriate for mature companies because you can’t use sales to pay dividends, buy back stock or make investments,” says Marshall. For that, you need earnings. The use of less conventional valuation tools like price-to-sales to rationalize bullish ratings works, until it doesn’t. “When something goes wrong, it’s kind of hard to find a floor because there’s no earnings or free cash flow floor underneath to support valuations,” says McWey. “And you never know when the rug is going to get pulled.” On the flip side, because valuations are high, it’s not easy to justify owning those stocks. “It’s really hard to see how these companies can be valued much higher than they are today,” says Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Frank Capital Partners, who sold his position in Microsoft MSFT, +0.58% in the fourth quarter. “I don’t think Microsoft is going to have a disaster. It’s a really great company. But it is fully valued.” However, many less substantial tech companies are so priced to perfection that “any little disappointment could result in significant downside,” he cautions. Credit Suisse cites Microsoft as a crowded trade. It is an overweight position in nearly half of S&P 500 benchmarked funds. Others include: Alphabet GOOG, +1.11% Facebook FB, +0.70% Salesforce.com CRM, +0.69% Adobe ADBE, +0.45% Vantiv VNTV, -0.17% Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO, +0.13% Electronic Arts EA, +0.19% Fiserv FISV, +0.15% ServiceNow NOW, +0.92% Guidewire Software GWRE, +1.40% CoStar CSGP, -0.47% Proofpoint PFPT, +0.21% Fidelity National Information Services FIS, +0.65% and Red Hat RHT, +0.17% Netflix NFLX, +5.79% arguably a software-services company, is the only FANG stock (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) that doesn’t appear on the overcrowded trade list. Technology hardware In a sluggish economy, investors have crowded into tech-hardware companies because they are among the few with decent growth. Here are some warning signs from Credit Suisse on this group that should grab your attention. The share of bullish sell-side ratings is at the highest level in over 15 years. Hedge-fund ownership is at all-time highs. And mutual fund exposure has been rising. Tech-hardware companies that look like crowded trades include Apple AAPL, +0.62% Cisco CSCO, +0.42% Western Digital WDC, +1.29% and Amphenol APH, +0.35% Consumer staples In a world of lousy returns from bonds because interest rates are so low, investors have turned to the stock market for bond substitutes. They’ve found them in consumer-staples companies that pay decent dividends and offer the potential for capital appreciation. The problem here is investors have driven these shares to valuations that are too high, given their relatively meager sales and earnings growth potential. “I sincerely doubt they will be able to grow earnings in alignment with their P/E ratios,” says McWey. But that’s not the only issue. Blinded by their love of dividends, investors have taken their eyes off potential risks. Competition in the grocery arena is fierce. A company like PepsiCo PEP, -0.14% can get hit by changes in consumer tastes. And input costs could go up a lot, crimping margins. “Add that into a very combustible mix of high valuations, and you could see significant declines even without a recession or a decrease in revenue growth,” says Frank, at Frank Capital Partners. Despite these risks, the number of mutual funds overweight in large-cap companies in food and staples retailing was recently hitting new highs, says Credit Suisse. The percentage of sell-side analysts with bullish ratings was also near highs for the past 15 years. Besides Pepsi, consumer-staples companies that look like crowded trades include Newell Brands ( NWL, +1.08% CVS Health CVS, +2.65% and Costco Wholesale COST, +0.20% Enjoy their products if you want. But be careful with their stocks, particularly if you’re thinking they might serve as a defense for your portfolio in a selloff. They probably won’t, especially if that selloff is sparked by rising interest rates, a likely scenario, because this hurts bonds and bond proxies like consumer-staples stocks.

So it’s refreshing when they come out with the rare critical look at the stock market and suggest stocks you might want to avoid. Credit Suisse takes a stab at this every quarter in a report that will delight any contrarian. The bank highlights “crowded trades,” or companies that are so favored by mutual fund managers and Wall Street analysts that they look like trouble. These quarterly reports, called “The Darlings of Active Managers” and “Carving Up the Consensus,” aren’t predictions that overcrowded sectors and stocks are about to crash. Instead, they’re names and groups that are more vulnerable to weakness because everyone loves them. The logic here is twofold. First, if everyone loves these stocks, who is left to buy them? And if they are priced to perfection, then just a little bad news might get a stampede going. Selling can beget selling, as the herd heads for the exits. Do you have what it takes to launch a successful startup?(2:00) David Jegen of F-Prime Capital, the venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments, talks to MarketWatch about what young entrepreneurs can do to secure funding for their startup. Credit Suisse says its research has a decent record of predicting underperformance, and it works best on crowded trades in the large-cap and growth categories. Who doesn’t like a winner? Since bullish crowds push stocks higher and this draws in even more investors who want to run with the bulls, it’s no surprise that the most crowded trades are usually the stocks that have performed the best. “The bias is that the recent past will repeat itself near term,” says Eric Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management. But the problem is that most of the potential profits have already been made in darling stocks, since they turn into crowded trades. “The best company in the world isn’t a great investment if everyone thinks it is the best company in the world,” says Marshall. Instead, stocks that offer the greatest opportunities are the ones that no one is talking about, he says. That’s how contrarians think. But people, being people, they often love to be with the crowd. So they pile into popular trades even if it’s not the best way to make money. Here are some of the most popular sectors and stocks today, according to Credit Suisse, which you may want to think twice about owning. “We recommend against owning too many of these names,” says Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina. Chips Investors are enthralled with semiconductor companies for two main reasons, says Heartland Advisors portfolio manager Colin McWey. One is the belief that wickedly volatile sales and inventory cycles have miraculously smoothed out. The other is a spate of mergers and acquisitions. This M&A is supposedly a plus because of “synergies,” cost cutting and cross-selling opportunities they bring. “It seems like folks have really gotten behind the consolidation,” says McWey. Buy-side bullishness is already a problem, but there’s more to the story. Sentiment is actually beginning to slip among portfolio managers. This could auger the beginning of a downtrend. “All of our buy-side indicators have plenty of room to retreat before reaching oversold conditions,” says Calvasina. There are more troubling signs on the sell side, because Wall Street analysts are on board in a big way. They have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings on chip stocks in years. “This indicator may be ripe for reversion,” says Calvasina. What might amp up the negativity among investors? Any sign that swings in demand and inventories are not really a thing of the past would be a big problem. This really shouldn’t be a surprise if it happens. This is the future of 3-D printing(2:19) Max Friefeld, CEO of Voodoo Manufacturing, the nation's first robot-operated 3-D printing hub, talks to MarketWatch about how 3-D printing can revolutionize mass manufacturing. “Ultimately these are still very cyclical businesses,” says McWey. Next, negativity could develop if investors see signs that the hoped-for gains from mergers aren’t panning out. This could easily happen too. “Historically, companies have a mixed track record with M&A,” says McWey. Credit Suisse says particularly crowded trades include Intel INTC, +0.33% Qualcomm QCOM, +0.36% MKS Instruments MKSI, +1.71% Microsemi MSCC, +0.44% Monolithic Power Systems MPWR, +1.01% and Lam Research LRCX, +2.28% Software services In a world short on growth, investors have crowded into the few sectors that display any. Companies that offer software and software-related services fit the bill. “These stocks have been priced to perfection because of their above-average growth in the past five years,” says Marshall, at Hodges Capital Management. “This is an area where we are underweight. We have a hard time getting comfortable with the valuations.” Alarmingly, both hedge-fund ownership and bullish sell-side ratings have reached historical highs, says Credit Suisse. To help justify bullish ratings, sell-side analysts have resorted to an old trick from the tech-bubble era. They’re valuing companies on the basis of price-to-sales. This can be a useful measure for young companies that have minimal earnings, because scant earnings make price-to-earnings multiples meaninglessly high. “But it’s less appropriate for mature companies because you can’t use sales to pay dividends, buy back stock or make investments,” says Marshall. For that, you need earnings. The use of less conventional valuation tools like price-to-sales to rationalize bullish ratings works, until it doesn’t. “When something goes wrong, it’s kind of hard to find a floor because there’s no earnings or free cash flow floor underneath to support valuations,” says McWey. “And you never know when the rug is going to get pulled.” On the flip side, because valuations are high, it’s not easy to justify owning those stocks. “It’s really hard to see how these companies can be valued much higher than they are today,” says Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Frank Capital Partners, who sold his position in Microsoft MSFT, +0.58% in the fourth quarter. “I don’t think Microsoft is going to have a disaster. It’s a really great company. But it is fully valued.” However, many less substantial tech companies are so priced to perfection that “any little disappointment could result in significant downside,” he cautions. Credit Suisse cites Microsoft as a crowded trade. It is an overweight position in nearly half of S&P 500 benchmarked funds. Others include: Alphabet GOOG, +1.11% Facebook FB, +0.70% Salesforce.com CRM, +0.69% Adobe ADBE, +0.45% Vantiv VNTV, -0.17% Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO, +0.13% Electronic Arts EA, +0.19% Fiserv FISV, +0.15% ServiceNow NOW, +0.92% Guidewire Software GWRE, +1.40% CoStar CSGP, -0.47% Proofpoint PFPT, +0.21% Fidelity National Information Services FIS, +0.65% and Red Hat RHT, +0.17% Netflix NFLX, +5.79% arguably a software-services company, is the only FANG stock (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) that doesn’t appear on the overcrowded trade list. Technology hardware In a sluggish economy, investors have crowded into tech-hardware companies because they are among the few with decent growth. Here are some warning signs from Credit Suisse on this group that should grab your attention. The share of bullish sell-side ratings is at the highest level in over 15 years. Hedge-fund ownership is at all-time highs. And mutual fund exposure has been rising. Tech-hardware companies that look like crowded trades include Apple AAPL, +0.62% Cisco CSCO, +0.42% Western Digital WDC, +1.29% and Amphenol APH, +0.35% Consumer staples In a world of lousy returns from bonds because interest rates are so low, investors have turned to the stock market for bond substitutes. They’ve found them in consumer-staples companies that pay decent dividends and offer the potential for capital appreciation. The problem here is investors have driven these shares to valuations that are too high, given their relatively meager sales and earnings growth potential. “I sincerely doubt they will be able to grow earnings in alignment with their P/E ratios,” says McWey. But that’s not the only issue. Blinded by their love of dividends, investors have taken their eyes off potential risks. Competition in the grocery arena is fierce. A company like PepsiCo PEP, -0.14% can get hit by changes in consumer tastes. And input costs could go up a lot, crimping margins. “Add that into a very combustible mix of high valuations, and you could see significant declines even without a recession or a decrease in revenue growth,” says Frank, at Frank Capital Partners. Despite these risks, the number of mutual funds overweight in large-cap companies in food and staples retailing was recently hitting new highs, says Credit Suisse. The percentage of sell-side analysts with bullish ratings was also near highs for the past 15 years. Besides Pepsi, consumer-staples companies that look like crowded trades include Newell Brands ( NWL, +1.08% CVS Health CVS, +2.65% and Costco Wholesale COST, +0.20% Enjoy their products if you want. But be careful with their stocks, particularly if you’re thinking they might serve as a defense for your portfolio in a selloff. They probably won’t, especially if that selloff is sparked by rising interest rates, a likely scenario, because this hurts bonds and bond proxies like consumer-staples stocks.

Join For Free MongoDB Atlas is a database as a service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB. So you can focus on innovation, not operations. Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. In the Splunk application database, there exist multiple solutions for enrichment and retrieving information that a certain IP address has been added to a certain reputation database and therefore looks suspicious. However, these solutions are either commercial (i.e. Recorded Future App or Kaspersky Threat Feed App) or tremendously slow (i.e. IP Reputation App, which, at the time of writing, hasn’t been fully available since February due to maintenance). That led us to develop our own open-source plugin, RST Cloud Threat Database Add-On for Splunk. It allows us to maintain a single database of reputation data gathered from various open resources and provides a response rate of tens of thousands of requests per second. We created the plugin using a small set of Python scripts that automatically enrich Splunk search results requesting additional details from external databases on the fly. We used Redis Key-Value storage as the database. Redis keeps everything in RAM and doesn’t depend on I/O latencies of the disk drives. We published the source code at GitHub. It’s open to suggestions for improvement. Our performance tests were executed on a dual-core Intel® Xeon® E5-2630 virtual machine with 4 Gb of RAM. The results indicate that even taking into account overheads from Python 2.7, virtualization on standard equipment and Splunk itself, with 300K records in Redis the plugin throughput averages at about 25K RPS, which is enough for a fair amount of tasks. Notice that these figures are acquired using “off the shelf” Redis with no additional optimization or clustering. Also, we haven’t yet used Redis pipelining mechanisms for database access in the search script. For example, we can use the plugin to detect web form spammers or connections to the website from infected IP addresses. In the console, we can easily print out a list of suspicious clients. sourcetype=Web:*:access_log host=www.demo.demo | fields clientip | dedup clientip |
lookup local=true lookupthreat clientip OUTPUT threatscore threatsource threatcategory |
where threatscore > 0 In the resulting data, we show its source, the category under which a certain IP address is listed in each reputation database, and the cumulative Threat Score. For your convenience, we also have a short-hand macro: `threatDB(clientip)` For environmental simplicity, Redis can be installed directly on Splunk Head or on another server or a server cluster. Besides, the RST Cloud Threat Database Add-On contains a number of scripts that automatically download data from various sources and import it to Redis. Nowadays, there exist a lot of reliable open resources for gathering suspicious and dangerous IP addresses. Our plugin supports more than 15 of them, including: Sblam! A blog, forum, and comment web-spammer database. StopForumSpam. A blog, forum, and wiki web-spammer database. CINS Score. A sentinel IPS database shared by the company. Blocklist.de. A database of addresses that attack Postfix, SSH, and Apache; Spambots, IRC-Bots, Reg-Bots, DDoS, etc. Ransomware Tracker. A CnC server addresses for Ransomware. AlienVault OTX. Open data feeds from the famous SIEM. Binary Defence. A specialized Threat Intelligence provider. EmergingThreats. We integrated ProofPoint feeds for blocking on firewalls. Arbor ATLAS. DDoS-attacking addresses from a very famous company. Botvrij. Malware-compromised addresses. Tor Project. Tor-network addresses. The database can include both individual addresses that you can search by the IP key: red.smembers('ip:'+clientip), and subnets that are handled by a looped script. Now, let’s take a look at the installation process. Step-by-step instructions: Install Redis. Install Python dependency libraries. Modify connection strings in the scripts. Set up a CRON-task for keeping the IP Reputation DB up to date. We’ll skip the first step, as it is explained in details at Redis’ website. Besides, on Debian, it’s just one command: apt-get install -y redis-server for a Redis server with default settings. To resolve Python library dependencies, it’s sufficient to run the following: wget bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
sudo pip install redis
sudo pip install netaddr It’s worth noting that Splunk uses its own Python, and it’s not recommended to modify it. Therefore, it’s better to install all extras to the Python in the operating system. Depending on Redis installation options, you might need to change addresses and ports in the following scripts: Main search script redisworker.py: sys.path.append("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages") # Path to redis-py module
redis_server = '127.0.0.1'
redis_port = 6379 Database clean up script threat_flushdb.py and updated IoC download script threatuploader.py: redis_server = '127.0.0.1'
redis_port = 6379 IoC download from various resources script start_threatupload.sh: base_dir=/opt/splunk/bin/scripts/threatDB
python_bindir=/usr/bin Then, you have to select a temporary folder: mkdir -p /tmp/threatsupload And set up CRON scheduler, i.e. using /etc/crontab: 2 0 * * * root $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/threatDB/bin/start_threatupload.sh /tmp/threatsupload We recommend using a separate account instead of root in the production environment. We’d like to point out that once-a-day default update frequency is more than enough because the TTL of the DB records is 48 hours. Commercial solutions provide a number of indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain addresses, hashes, file paths, mutex names, etc. These allow for identification of malicious software activity inside an organization. We concentrate on web security, thus our plugin only works with IP addresses. In future, we plan to improve the performance of the plugin and extend its functionality. Among everything else, we plan to add DNS reputation database feeds, thus making the plugin applicable to additional tasks.

So it’s refreshing when they come out with the rare critical look at the stock market and suggest stocks you might want to avoid. Credit Suisse takes a stab at this every quarter in a report that will delight any contrarian. The bank highlights “crowded trades,” or companies that are so favored by mutual fund managers and Wall Street analysts that they look like trouble. These quarterly reports, called “The Darlings of Active Managers” and “Carving Up the Consensus,” aren’t predictions that overcrowded sectors and stocks are about to crash. Instead, they’re names and groups that are more vulnerable to weakness because everyone loves them. The logic here is twofold. First, if everyone loves these stocks, who is left to buy them? And if they are priced to perfection, then just a little bad news might get a stampede going. Selling can beget selling, as the herd heads for the exits. Do you have what it takes to launch a successful startup?(2:00) David Jegen of F-Prime Capital, the venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments, talks to MarketWatch about what young entrepreneurs can do to secure funding for their startup. Credit Suisse says its research has a decent record of predicting underperformance, and it works best on crowded trades in the large-cap and growth categories. Who doesn’t like a winner? Since bullish crowds push stocks higher and this draws in even more investors who want to run with the bulls, it’s no surprise that the most crowded trades are usually the stocks that have performed the best. “The bias is that the recent past will repeat itself near term,” says Eric Marshall, director of research at Hodges Capital Management. But the problem is that most of the potential profits have already been made in darling stocks, since they turn into crowded trades. “The best company in the world isn’t a great investment if everyone thinks it is the best company in the world,” says Marshall. Instead, stocks that offer the greatest opportunities are the ones that no one is talking about, he says. That’s how contrarians think. But people, being people, they often love to be with the crowd. So they pile into popular trades even if it’s not the best way to make money. Here are some of the most popular sectors and stocks today, according to Credit Suisse, which you may want to think twice about owning. “We recommend against owning too many of these names,” says Credit Suisse chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina. Chips Investors are enthralled with semiconductor companies for two main reasons, says Heartland Advisors portfolio manager Colin McWey. One is the belief that wickedly volatile sales and inventory cycles have miraculously smoothed out. The other is a spate of mergers and acquisitions. This M&A is supposedly a plus because of “synergies,” cost cutting and cross-selling opportunities they bring. “It seems like folks have really gotten behind the consolidation,” says McWey. Buy-side bullishness is already a problem, but there’s more to the story. Sentiment is actually beginning to slip among portfolio managers. This could auger the beginning of a downtrend. “All of our buy-side indicators have plenty of room to retreat before reaching oversold conditions,” says Calvasina. There are more troubling signs on the sell side, because Wall Street analysts are on board in a big way. They have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings on chip stocks in years. “This indicator may be ripe for reversion,” says Calvasina. What might amp up the negativity among investors? Any sign that swings in demand and inventories are not really a thing of the past would be a big problem. This really shouldn’t be a surprise if it happens. This is the future of 3-D printing(2:19) Max Friefeld, CEO of Voodoo Manufacturing, the nation's first robot-operated 3-D printing hub, talks to MarketWatch about how 3-D printing can revolutionize mass manufacturing. “Ultimately these are still very cyclical businesses,” says McWey. Next, negativity could develop if investors see signs that the hoped-for gains from mergers aren’t panning out. This could easily happen too. “Historically, companies have a mixed track record with M&A,” says McWey. Credit Suisse says particularly crowded trades include Intel INTC, +0.33% Qualcomm QCOM, +0.36% MKS Instruments MKSI, +1.71% Microsemi MSCC, +0.44% Monolithic Power Systems MPWR, +1.01% and Lam Research LRCX, +2.28% Software services In a world short on growth, investors have crowded into the few sectors that display any. Companies that offer software and software-related services fit the bill. “These stocks have been priced to perfection because of their above-average growth in the past five years,” says Marshall, at Hodges Capital Management. “This is an area where we are underweight. We have a hard time getting comfortable with the valuations.” Alarmingly, both hedge-fund ownership and bullish sell-side ratings have reached historical highs, says Credit Suisse. To help justify bullish ratings, sell-side analysts have resorted to an old trick from the tech-bubble era. They’re valuing companies on the basis of price-to-sales. This can be a useful measure for young companies that have minimal earnings, because scant earnings make price-to-earnings multiples meaninglessly high. “But it’s less appropriate for mature companies because you can’t use sales to pay dividends, buy back stock or make investments,” says Marshall. For that, you need earnings. The use of less conventional valuation tools like price-to-sales to rationalize bullish ratings works, until it doesn’t. “When something goes wrong, it’s kind of hard to find a floor because there’s no earnings or free cash flow floor underneath to support valuations,” says McWey. “And you never know when the rug is going to get pulled.” On the flip side, because valuations are high, it’s not easy to justify owning those stocks. “It’s really hard to see how these companies can be valued much higher than they are today,” says Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Frank Capital Partners, who sold his position in Microsoft MSFT, +0.58% in the fourth quarter. “I don’t think Microsoft is going to have a disaster. It’s a really great company. But it is fully valued.” However, many less substantial tech companies are so priced to perfection that “any little disappointment could result in significant downside,” he cautions. Credit Suisse cites Microsoft as a crowded trade. It is an overweight position in nearly half of S&P 500 benchmarked funds. Others include: Alphabet GOOG, +1.11% Facebook FB, +0.70% Salesforce.com CRM, +0.69% Adobe ADBE, +0.45% Vantiv VNTV, -0.17% Take-Two Interactive Software TTWO, +0.13% Electronic Arts EA, +0.19% Fiserv FISV, +0.15% ServiceNow NOW, +0.92% Guidewire Software GWRE, +1.40% CoStar CSGP, -0.47% Proofpoint PFPT, +0.21% Fidelity National Information Services FIS, +0.65% and Red Hat RHT, +0.17% Netflix NFLX, +5.79% arguably a software-services company, is the only FANG stock (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) that doesn’t appear on the overcrowded trade list. Technology hardware In a sluggish economy, investors have crowded into tech-hardware companies because they are among the few with decent growth. Here are some warning signs from Credit Suisse on this group that should grab your attention. The share of bullish sell-side ratings is at the highest level in over 15 years. Hedge-fund ownership is at all-time highs. And mutual fund exposure has been rising. Tech-hardware companies that look like crowded trades include Apple AAPL, +0.62% Cisco CSCO, +0.42% Western Digital WDC, +1.29% and Amphenol APH, +0.35% Consumer staples In a world of lousy returns from bonds because interest rates are so low, investors have turned to the stock market for bond substitutes. They’ve found them in consumer-staples companies that pay decent dividends and offer the potential for capital appreciation. The problem here is investors have driven these shares to valuations that are too high, given their relatively meager sales and earnings growth potential. “I sincerely doubt they will be able to grow earnings in alignment with their P/E ratios,” says McWey. But that’s not the only issue. Blinded by their love of dividends, investors have taken their eyes off potential risks. Competition in the grocery arena is fierce. A company like PepsiCo PEP, -0.14% can get hit by changes in consumer tastes. And input costs could go up a lot, crimping margins. “Add that into a very combustible mix of high valuations, and you could see significant declines even without a recession or a decrease in revenue growth,” says Frank, at Frank Capital Partners. Despite these risks, the number of mutual funds overweight in large-cap companies in food and staples retailing was recently hitting new highs, says Credit Suisse. The percentage of sell-side analysts with bullish ratings was also near highs for the past 15 years. Besides Pepsi, consumer-staples companies that look like crowded trades include Newell Brands ( NWL, +1.08% CVS Health CVS, +2.65% and Costco Wholesale COST, +0.20% Enjoy their products if you want. But be careful with their stocks, particularly if you’re thinking they might serve as a defense for your portfolio in a selloff. They probably won’t, especially if that selloff is sparked by rising interest rates, a likely scenario, because this hurts bonds and bond proxies like consumer-staples stocks.

Check these samples Games / Call of Duty: WWII details leak ahead of livestream By Hadlee Simons on 25 April, 2017 Activision-Blizzard may have confirmed the Call of Duty: WWII name and setting, but it’s choosing to leave the rest of the details to a livestream tomorrow (26 April). Now, Charlie Intel has uncovered a slew of details, including marketing materials, a release date and more. Which battlefields will be covered in this entry, then? “Call of Duty returns to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII — a breathtaking experience that redefines World War II for a new gaming generation. Land in Normandy on D-Day and battle across Europe through iconic locations in history’s most monumental war,” reads a supposedly leaked description. “Experience classic Call of Duty combat, the bonds of camaraderie, and the unforgiving nature of war against a global power throwing the world into tyranny.” The D-Day landings have been done many times before, with Medal of Honor: Frontline, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2 all having some variation on it. Here’s hoping we see something fresh otherwise. Call of Duty: WWII returns to the beaches of Normandy, but how will it make this umpteenth take stand out from prior games? The popular multiplayer suite seems to be back in this iteration though. “Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer engages players grounded, fast-paced combat across many of World War II’s most iconic locations. Players will also enjoy exciting new ways to interact and socialise with their friends and the Call of Duty community.” Don’t care for competitive multiplayer? Then it’s claimed that a cooperative mode is in the game, complete with a “new and original story”. It’s believed that Call of Duty: WWII storms the beaches on 3 November 2017.

The flying car makes its perennial return Science Colliders, containers, dark matter: The CERN atom smasher's careful cloud revolution No downtime till 2018 Photo copyright CERN 25 Apr 2017 at 08:36, Gavin Clarke CERN made headlines with the discovery by physicists in 2012 of the Higgs boson, paving the way to a breakthrough in our understanding of how fundamental particles interact. Central to this was the Large Hadron Collider – a 26km ring of interconnected magnets chilled to -271.3C straddling the Franco-Swiss border. The LHC is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. But 2012 was notable for another reason: an overhaul of the IT infrastructure that CERN's army of physicists using LHC and four other accelerators depend on to run their experiments and crunch their data. In came OpenStack – then two years old – replacing a stack of in-house Perl scripts. Also new in was CentOS, Ceph, Hadoop, Kibana, Jenkins and Puppet. OpenStack introduced elastic compute to CERN, a software-defined infrastructure giving scientists the resources they want in the time it takes to get a cup of coffee rather than raise a helpdesk ticket and then wait for the Linux servers to be reconfigured. CERN is not defined by Higgs and its physicists are today probing areas including dark energy and dark matter. Something that's also evolved in that brand-new IT infrastructure is containers. "One thing we've seen a lot of recently is container technologies," Tim Bell, CERN's head of computing told The Reg during an interview. Yes, containers have been taken on across the entire industry but have found particular utility among the atom smashers of CERN. Containers have become a way for scientists to run legacy code from old experiments with newer work – the CERN laboratory is 63 years old and the LHC was fired up in 2008. Applications are written mostly using C++ with some Fortran and Python. Despite this, there's a range of code that needs updating. Bell told us: "The ability to encapsulate in the whole container the software and the operating system is very interesting. When we are running legacy code from previous experiments that need to be nicely isolated from where we have applications broken down into micro services that have different operating system requirements – we can meet that with a set of containers. Insertion of the LHC beam pipe during a scheduled shutdown. Photo copyright CERN "We are already seeing cases where one piece of code has been upgraded to the latest version but not another part – having this flex is a very interesting option." So far, CERN has a small container environment – 1,000 nodes were spun up during a Kubernetes stress test that served seven million requests. But from small beginnings come big things, and the experiment proves what the IT infrastructure is capable of delivering. "It means if someone comes to us with a large application, the fact we have done a significant scaling test means we are confident of meeting that need," Bell said. No nasty surprises – or smooth evolution – is vital for an infrastructure as important as CERN's. Its OpenStack clouds run 24/7 – workloads are constant with experiments and results crunched on available compute. Downtime, when it happens, takes place at phased intervals. Operations on the LHC itself are planned in a series of what CERN calls "runs" of three to four years in length with a shutdown in between for upgrades to the accelerator and the experiments between runs. The current run, number two, is due to end in 2018 with the subsequent shutdown scheduled to finish in 2019. As for the lifespan of CERN's servers, that's typically five years. "There's always interest in tracking what happens in tech. We are a naturally technology oriented organisation – so people do experiment with Go and things like that," Bell explains. "However, there's also and understanding of the cost." Bell's infrastructure team therefore performs careful due diligence on any new technology that its scientist-coders wish to run on OpenStack. "If every time you adopt the latest language then after 10 years you have a wide variety of different things that a new person has to learn, so we are attentive of the fact we need to not only look at what's the latest thing but also the sustainability of the underlying environment." New technologies are therefore subject to extensive pilot-phase testing. "Sometimes these things sounds really great when you read the blogs but it's only with real life that you can assess the application architecture," Bell said. The embracing of open source at CERN extends beyond just the technology. It's a philosophy, too – a fact that helps Bell's team minimise adoption risk. CERN works with open-source communities at an early stage of project development, feeding in ideas and helping make sure changes are threaded into its own infrastructure gradually – once code has been productised. "One of the things we have been doing is work upstream of open-source communities like OpenStack, which means we can contribute improvements but – equally – look to the community, which we can also be helping out, for the long-term sustainability," Bell said. Engagement also means CERN's engineers get to understand new technologies before they are finalised. "A new person is actually mentored as part of their work with the community giving feedback on the code they've submitted, so we don't need to do everything ourselves," Bell said. "We can use some of the communities to keep things going and contribute to them." The Antihydrogen trap experiment to compare hydrogen atoms with their antimatter equivalents. Photo copyright CERN When it comes to judging which open-source projects or software to bring onboard, CERN applies a number of rules: diversity – are you working on a project with one vendor or different vendors? – quality of documentation, and does that project follow open-source processes? And even after that, CERN treads carefully as – even in open source – choices can mean commitment and an unofficial lock-in. Nowhere more so than in the fast-paced world of the developer, where if you're "right" technology adoption comes fast. Take containers. Following a six-month pilot on 20 applications, CERN at the end of 2016 adopted OpenStack's Magnum to run Kubernetes, Mesos, Docker and Swarm, side-stepping the need to commit to one early on in the life of containers. Should a shakeup or consolidation hit containers, CERN shouldn't be left high and dry. "We don't need to make a choice at this point which one is going to be the most popular – we can let users choose the one they like," Bell said. "The users were very interested in container techs and it also wasn't very clear what the best container orchestration engines would be. "Magnum lets us use all the investment we'd got in OpenStack in Project Magnum quotas and in capacity planning and deliver a container orchestration as a service that allows the user to get the Kubernetes cluster in a click." Retiring servers It's not just CERN's software that's evolving – so, too, is the hardware powering it. One factor is the driving nature of CERN's 25 experiments and the volume of data they generate. That volume has nearly doubled in the last few years: an archive of 100PB in 2014 is now 187PB with an extra 49PB from the LHC alone in the last year. Storage hardware has increased – 12,500 servers, 85,000 disk drives and 24,000 tapes today versus 11,000 servers, 75,000 disk drives with 45,000 tapes in 2014. Applications and compute that had been running on four massive OpenStack clouds of 3,000 servers and 70,000 cores are today on 7,000 and 220,000 cores with 100,000 added to the compute fabric since last October. CERN works closely with Intel to find out what's coming in chip giant's planned roadmaps to keep abreast of changes. As Intel's hardware has changed CERN is now, for the first time, retiring its older servers. Systems are coming in that deliver greater performance and power efficiency. The new systems are based on Intel E5 2650 processors with 40-48 cores, replacing Intel L5520 with 16-core configurations. CERN is conducting live migrations using OpenStack. All this as CERN has begun optimising its programs – those experiments expressed in code on colliders like LHC – for parallel processing. "With multiple simultaneous collisions... trying to work out whether a proton collided here or there is a complicated computing problem and that's where we are seeing an exponential computing growth – data comes in and computing goes up," Bell said. "There's all kinds of work we need to do on algorithms and the programs – we won't necessarily be meeting all this computing need by putting in more cores. There's a very big effort going on with the experiments to optimise their programming on the environments we have. "For example using the latest features of processors like vectorisation, getting more running in a parallel stream at any time – that requires a lot of work on the physics code that's been developed over the last 10-20 years, so with that some of the algorithms need to be reworked to be tuned to the latest generation of processors.

Photo copyright CERN "The way the physicists work is they build different analysis algorithms within a framework but one of the challenges is if the code's been written by a large number of people so that it optimises a large program – that requires breaking that down and finding the core algorithm and optimising them." CERN is restricted in its physical expansion, power and cooling – one reason for work virtualization. CERN runs 26,000 virtual machines, an increase of about 10,000 since 2015. CERN has also started to run workloads on public cloud – the Helix Nebula imitative has been run on 4,000 nodes in T-Systems' Open Telecom Cloud. There have also been tests on AWS. The experiment there is as much business as technical – testing whether AWS can be purchased via CERN's standard procurement model. Bell says CERN is interested in how far it can adopt standard public cloud resources through its standard procurement models. "That's one of the interesting questions: how to purchase bulk resources from hyper-scale providers," Bell said. For Bell, yes, the future of CERN's technology evolution is about embracing the new but making it fit comfortably within that big-bang infrastructure upgrade of 2012. "There will certainly be major technology changes – we are looking around at GPU and multi-core technologies and through collaboration with the industry we investigate those," Bell said. "We saw a major transformation in 2012 in how we did IT and we hope that model would continue for a significant time. "I'd certainly expect you'd continue to see disruptive technologies like containers to continue to appear, but what I'd hope is you'd keep the same framework so they aren't so disturbed by their appearance." ® Tips and corrections 9 Comments MORE Linux Open Source Cern Large Hadron Collider More from The Register Linux-using mates gone AWOL?

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles Elite: Dangerous PC A three-year-old Elite Dangerous mystery is finally unravelling A conspiracy, a derelict megaship and a crew gone mad. By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 25/04/2017 Elite Dangerous players have taken a significant step in solving a mystery that has befuddled its most rabid secret-hunters ever since the game came out. The Formidine Rift mystery, as it's known, kicked off back in 2014 with the release of Drew Wagar's novel Elite Reclamation. Since then players have searched for clues in an attempt to solve this mystery. This week, a major discovery was made that suggests a solution is near. Elite Dangerous is no stranger to cool mysteries, ARGs and in-game secrets, and its community of players is infamous for spending months - sometimes years - trying to make sense of teases and clues planted both in-game and out by developer Frontier that may or may not relate to the coming of an evil alien race called the Thargoids. The Formidine Rift mystery, though, is probably Elite Dangerous' longest-running puzzle. It was set in motion over three years ago, with clues dating back to January 2014, when author Drew Wagar was putting the finishing touches to his officially-licensed, considered canon book, Elite Reclamation. Drew Wagar wrote Elite Reclamation long before the game was available. Elite Reclamation features an old lady called Rebecca, who spoke of something lost within the Formidine Rift, something she couldn't quite recall because, it appeared, her memory had been wiped. But she knew this much: what she found there was extremely dangerous. Ever since the novel came out, Elite Dangerous players have tried to work out what Rebecca was talking about. All they had to go on was a vague trajectory plot found in secret Imperial data banks: "Take a line from Reorte to Riedquat to the edge of the arm ... and keep going." This being Elite, players kept going, triangulating the course as they uncovered clues such as beacons and bases. Along the way players discovered abandoned settlements in the Rift, settlements that included data that discussed an expedition from which no-one returned. But what was the expedition for? What was its goal? Players had no idea. "For a long time we've known the Formidine Rift area was hiding secrets," CMDR Jackie Silver, intelligence officer of the Children of Raxxla, says. The Children of Raxxla is a group of players who are dedicated to uncovering the truth behind some of the mysteries of the Elite universe (the titular Raxxla is a legendary lost planet described in the novella which accompanied the original Elite). "The area has been intensely searched by pilots for years, she says. "Fairly recently, a series of communications satellites were found in three areas of the galaxy, including some near the Rift, and they pointed to abandoned bases on the surfaces of a few planets. "The bases were associated with the mysterious Dynasty Expedition, which had been seeding beacons in remote places; the working hypothesis is that these beacons are possible areas of refuge in the event of some catastrophe overtaking humanity. (Human settlements in the game are mostly limited to within a few hundred light years of Earth.)" The Formidine Rift is an area of space located between the Outer Perseus Arm and the New Galactic Arm. Image courtesy of Frontier forum user Acheron Kimald. On 16th April - over three years after Elite Reclamation was released - the community was given a prod with the release of a transmission from an old, scrapped Cobra Mk 3 exploration ship by The Galactic News Network, aka Galnet. The message consisted of a series of 20 or so mythological references. The Elite community set to work. Members of the Children of Raxxla were among the first to crack the code. Its members noticed that the first letters of the answers to the riddles included among them the word Rebecca, which the Children of Raxxla knew to be the name of the owner of the old Cobra. A significant clue, then. But another came soon after: it turned out the remaining letters are the name of a star sector set way out across the Formidine Rift. The full message indicated a particular system within that sector: SYREADIAE JX-F C0. "Those of us who were (relatively!) nearby immediately set off," CMDR Jackie Silver, who is credited with the discovery, says. "And pretty much everyone else in Intel made the galactic equivalent of handbrake turns and headed towards the Rift. "I was docked at an asteroid base in the Heart Nebula a few thousand light years away, and joined up with fellow intel members CMDRs Sajime, Aleister Fox and Andrew Gaspurr as a wing of ships. "Crossing the Formidine Rift can still be difficult even for a heavily modified exploration ship like the Diamondback I was flying, but after a couple of hours or thereabouts I was approaching the target system with CMDR Sajime close behind flying a much more capable Anaconda. "When I jumped into the system, I immediately noticed the presence of a signal in orbit around the first planet, powered up my ship's meagre defences and dropped out of frameshift (warp drive, more or less) and found a giant derelict ship, the Zurara." The Zurara, the megaship at the heart of the Formidine Rift mystery. Image courtesy of the Children of Raxxla. This derelict ship is a gargantuan megaship - the biggest class of ship in Elite Dangerous. Megaships were introduced into the game with the recent 2.3 The Commanders update, and are comparable in size to most stations. But there was something off about this particular megaship - everyone on board was dead. It was quite obvious to CMDR Jackie Silver, a lifelong fan of the Elite series and sometime astrophysics graduate, that the Zurara was significant. "I was very nervous," she says. "When I first saw the ship, I was relieved that it looked to be a human ship - not hostile aliens!" CMDR Jackie Silver found the ship's log files were accessible by scanning different points on the ship - and at that point something very unusual for Elite Dangerous occurred: voice acting. The first log was in full audio. The second log opened and CMDR Jackie Silver heard Rebecca's own voice. "I was very taken by that," she says. "She's a character we've known about for a long time, and to hear her speak..." CMDR Shabooka, another member of the Children of Raxxla, was watching the discovery unfold in the group's Discord server. "I won't lie, I flipped out a little," he says. "We've been looking for answers in this particular area of the galaxy for a long time, and when we discovered that what we just found was profoundly significant to the story, I lost it. Girly squeals, lots of giggling, and trying not to yell because it was midnight and my wife and baby were asleep." CMDR Shabooka created the video, below, which contains the audio logs. (If you want to avoid spoilers for what they contain, don't watch the video or read on.) The logs indicate the Zurara was a part of the mysterious Dynasty Expedition players had already discovered, and that the people who sent the megaship never intended for it to return. The logs also suggest the ship was sabotaged with a mind-altering poison that turned some of the crew into killers. The implication is that there is some grand and highly resourced conspiracy being played out among the major powers of the game - the Federals, the Imperials and the Alliance - and that they're doing so because they are scared that something terrible will happen soon. The coming of the Thargoids? Perhaps. Whatever the case, all this appears to be some kind of contingency plan. The Formidine Rift mystery was conceived by author Drew Wagar and incorporated into the game by Frontier, but what's cool is the actions of Elite Dangerous players are being factored into the sequel to Elite Reclamation, Elite Premonition. According to Wagar, Premonition dramatises the behind-the-scenes story of events taking place in the Elite Dangerous universe, combining the overall narrative from Frontier with in-game player activities and exploits. "This book isn't aiming just to be a compelling story, nor is it just a chronicle of what happened after events in-game," Wagar wrote in a post on his blog. "It has been and is still being written 'live' as the story develops and continues to be steered by player actions." The finalé of Premonition, Wagar says, will be determined by players. To this end, a combat-focused in-game event that revolves around an in-universe character called Commander Salomé, aka Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, is planned for 29th April. CMDR Salomé, protagonist of Wagar's Elite novels, is the person responsible for releasing information on this conspiracy - and as a result there is a bounty on her head. Here's the setup: CMDR Salomé, formerly the disgraced Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, is wanted by the Empire. She is accused of terrorism and is a convicted criminal, found guilty of the attempted assassination of Fleet Admiral Denton Patreus. Her co-conspirators; CMDRs Raan Corsen, Tsu Singh and Yuri Nakamura are also wanted for aiding and abetting her in her plans to destabilise the galaxy. So far they have evaded justice and remain at large. Intelligence reports indicate that they will be attempting to reach an unconfirmed destination in the heart of the core worlds (the bubble) for reasons unknown aided by disaffected factions and other malcontents. A bounty of 5 Million credits is offered for Salomé's death. 2 Million credits is offered, apiece, on receipt of similar proof of her conspirators' demise. Consider all of them armed and extremely dangerous. They, and those helping them, have been sighted in and around the Col 70 Sector, in the vicinity of the 46 Eridani system. Do not engage in communications. Show no mercy. Kill them all on sight. The actions of players during this in-game event determines the fate of the in-game characters, including CMDR Salomé. Wagar has insisted that "if they die, they die". What if players kill all the characters? "So be it. That is a valid end to the story. The player-base decides the outcome. Our view is that in open mode everyone is 'role-playing' even if they're not consciously doing so. From a story perspective there are some contingency plans for continuity if this occurs." So there you have it: the hunt for CMDR Salomé is on. Will players kill her? Or will they defend her? "Her survival could be the key to everything that happens next," CMDR Jackie Silver says. Whatever happens, the Children of Raxxla wait with baited breath for the next clue in the Formidine Rift mystery. Salomé, it turns out, is the group's figurehead leader. This is their moment.

The PC DIY channel has seen dropping sales during the past two years and the situation is especially worsening in China and this has greatly impacted motherboard players. To maintain their profits, most players have turned to focus on the gaming sector to push mid-range and high-end motherboards. Although Intel has prepared new Kaby Lake processors and Optane Memory for the first quarter in the hopes to stimulate PC demand, but motherboard players' sales for Z270-based products that support Optane Memory were still weaker than expected. Asustek Computer and Gigabyte Technology each shipped less than four million motherboards in the first quarter and despite the motherboards' increased ASP, the players still see falling profits from the business. In 2013, worldwide PC DIY motherboard shipments were around 75 million units, only down slightly from 80 million units in 2012. Among the volume, 15 million units were supplied to regional brand vendors, while 60 million units were used in PC DIY products. However, the number dropped to 69 million units in 2014 and decrease over 20% on year in 2015 to reach 54 million units. In 2016, shipments dropped below 50 million units and are expected to drop another 10% in 2017. However, Nvidia has greatly benefited from the graphics card market during the past two years despite the market also seeing falling demand. Since Nvidia has a dominant share in the market, it has gradually become influential with its downstream graphics card player partners in terms of giving supply priority, pricing, marketing and product designs. Motherboard and graphics card players are also concerned about Nvidia's Founder Edition product line and believe the GPU giant is looking to compete against them for the most profitable sector, despite Nvidia having refused such a claim. Since AMD is unlikely to achieve a major recovery in the short term, Nvidia is expected to continue owning strong control of the worldwide GPU industry, allowing it to have leadership in gaming notebook, desktop, graphics card as well as virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence (AI) markets.

Shin-Etsu has advised Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics (UMC) to sign three-year contracts to ensure sufficient supply from the wafer supplier, said the sources. Other customers of Shin-Etsu including Intel and Globalfoundries have agreed to strike the long-term supply contracts, the sources indicated. In addition, Shin-Etsu has recently expanded its production capacity for 12-inch wafers for use in the manufacture of 10nm and more-advanced node chips, the sources noted. Other wafer suppliers including Sumco and Siltronic have no plans to expand capacity, but are also seeking to secure long-term contracts from their major chipmaking customers, the sources said. Wafer demand has been rising driven by flash memory makers' transition to 3D NAND chips, foundries' 10nm ramp-ups and development for 7nm and more advanced process technologies, and China-based firms' aggressive 12-inch fab expansions. Prices particularly those for 12-inch wafers have risen around 10% quarterly, the sources identified. In other news, Sumco has already reached an agreement with TSMC for the supply of wafers over the next four years, according to a recent Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report. The agreement also includes Sumco's promise not to raise wafer quotes over 40%, said the report, without citing its source.

However as we all found out, Darwin will still built and maintained on Intel, as it was a very secretive plan B, in case something went wrong with the PowerPC platform. Being portable had saved NeXT before, and now it would save Apple. So with this little background, and a lot of stumbling around in the dark, I came up with some steps, that have permitted me to build the Darwin 0.1 kernel under DR2. This is beyond awesome.

He starts in July. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 2 hours ago The University of Pittsburgh's medical school generates a vast amount of data on health outcomes. And Rob Rutenbar, who the university hired this month as its senior vice chancellor for research, wants to see what's possible when that data lands on the desks of Pitt's top economists, computer engineers, chemists or bioethicists. Rutenbar, the head of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a former Carnegie Mellon University professor, will start in July at Pitt with a mission to coordinate the university's departments to push innovation and tackle weighty research projects. Rutenbar wants to marshal Pitt's resources to make it more competitive for “big things,” he said in an interview with the Tribune-Review. And by “big things,” Rutenbar means funding for centers and institutes totaling tens of millions of dollars. “There is a tech landscape. There is a business landscape. There is an engineering landscape, and there is a medical landscape,” Rutenbar said of Pitt's academic footprint. “All of these folks have to talk to each other or these things aren't going to work.” Pitt receives about $760 million a year in research funding. Rutenbar said his challenge is to take that to the next level. “His experience as a researcher, innovator, collaborator and entrepreneur — both inside and outside of the university — make Rob uniquely qualified to support our faculty's research and innovation efforts and to champion Pitt research on a local, national and global scale,” Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said in a statement. The university would not release Rutenbar's salary. Rutenbar taught in CMU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for 25 years before leaving to head the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Department of Computer Science, ranked No. 5 in the country by U.S. News and World Report. He founded two startups while at CMU and was the founding director of the university's Center for Circuit and System Solutions. The C2S2, as the center was called, was funded jointly by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Intel, IBM, Texas Instruments and other companies in the semiconductor industry. The multi-university center had about $45 million in funding over several years while Rutenbar ran it. Rutenbar made it clear he wasn't coming to Pitt to put the school in competition with Carnegie Mellon University, which boasts the nation's top computer science program, according to the U.S. News and World Report. “I don't think it's a catching up game,” Rutenbar said. “I think this is a way to exploit the intellectual assets that we have.” Aaron Aupperlee is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

(John Locher/The Associated Press) Related Stories Flynn made $1.3M US from lobbying, speeches to Russian companies Disgraced ex-Trump adviser Flynn gathered intel for Turkey on cleric living in U.S. Congressman Nunes departs from Russia probe, is subject to ethics investigation 'General Flynn has a story to tell': Disgraced ex-Trump adviser could give testimony FBI reportedly got court order to monitor Trump adviser Trump and Russia: The complexity of sorting out shadowy meetings 'designed to be deniable' 'Most dangerous diplomat' becomes central figure in Trump team's ties to Moscow U.S. House intelligence committee chair says there's no evidence for Trump's wiretap claims President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said Tuesday. The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 US in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey's government. The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and Tuesday's announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. Congressmen Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, and Elijah Cummings, Democrat from Maryland, said they saw no evidence that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant-general, properly disclosed foreign payments he received to military officials or on his security clearance paperwork. Flynn, who headed the military's top intelligence agency, was Trump's national security adviser until he was fired in February. Among the payments in question was more than $33,000 that Flynn received in 2015 from the Russia Today television network, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia's government. Members of the House committee Elijah Cummings, left, and Jason Chaffetz, right, speak Tuesday about the failure of short-lived national security adviser Michael Flynn to disclose payments for a 2015 speech in Moscow on a security clearance application. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) "That money needs to be recovered," said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated as a retired Army officer to request permission from both the Defence and State departments about prospective foreign government payments before he received them. "There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law," Chaffetz said. Cummings said Flynn's failure to formally report the Russian payments on his security clearance paperwork amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said Flynn reported his plans to travel to Russia to his former agency, the Defence Intelligence Agency, and he briefed officials there after he returned. Kelner declined to answer questions about whether Flynn properly disclosed the payments. The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by the Defence Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. But Cummings said the documents were "extremely troubling" and he urged the administration to declassify them. FBI confirms probe into possible links between Russia, Trump associates Key players in the Michael Flynn affair White House response deemed 'unacceptable' Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defence Department's inspector general for a final determination as to whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges and seek to recover the payments Flynn received. Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn's foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information, weren't relevant to the committee's investigation and could not be turned over. "That is simply unacceptable," Cummings said. 100 days of Trump14:54 At the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the committee's request for Flynn's security clearance information was referred to the Defence Department, which turned over documents. He said the White House did not release a detailed list of Flynn's contacts with foreign officials, a request he dismissed as "outlandish." Spicer said that the president was confident in his decision to fire Flynn in February on grounds that Flynn had misled vice-president Mike Pence about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Spicer declined to say whether the White House believed Flynn had violated the law. He said the conduct occurred before Flynn was appointed national security adviser in January. Kelner, Flynn's attorney, said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. During his briefings, Flynn "answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip," Kelner said. Yates, Clapper to testify in 2 weeks A spokesman for the Defence Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow "in accordance with standard security clearance procedures." A spokesman for Flynn has said that Flynn also disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. Chaffetz and Cummings said the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. Chaffetz added that while "it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied," he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. Sally Yates, who clashed with the Trump administration in her brief time as acting attorney general before Jeff Session's confirmation, will give testimony in early May to a Senate subcommittee into the Michael Flynn affair. (Carolyn Kaster/The Associated Press) Both Cummings and Chaffetz said the committee's investigation into Flynn's foreign payments includes examining consulting work he did for a Turkish businessman last year. Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have principally benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In government filings, Flynn disclosed that he personally received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his stake in Flynn Intel Group, the company that performed the foreign agent work. Earlier Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn's firing. Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was cancelled and has yet to be rescheduled. Some Democrats believe the White House wants to limit what Yates says publicly, but the White House has denied this. Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper is also to testify at the May 8 hearing. Also Tuesday, there were complaints that the Senate investigation was not moving quickly enough. Democratic senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California said they believed the committee needed to move at a faster rate. Preliminary interviews now have been completed with about 27 individuals from multiple intelligence agencies. And there are nine staffers working full-time on the investigation, according to one Senate aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity. By contrast, the House Select Committee on Benghazi employed more than 50 congressional staffers. The aide said the committee has gained access to additional materials at intelligence agencies, including categories and types of intelligence documents that have never been provided to Congress before. Committee members and staff are reviewing thousands of pages of materials at CIA headquarters and the National Security Agency. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Video CBC's Margaret Evans on South Sudan's famine 2:58 Freeland: 'It's just harder for a woman out there' 0:29 Lagarde: 'Women are not a threat' 0:30 Trump: 'We still have formidable problems in our own right' 0:34 Most Viewed North Korea says it's ready to strike U.S. aircraft carrier 'We don't blame you': Wisconsin farmers on Trump's blast at Canada's dairy industry Macron, Le Pen qualify for 2nd round of France's presidential election Trump's bluster doing nothing to neutralize North Korea's nuclear ambitions Venezuela spiralling into chaos amid looting, militarized police Marine Le Pen steps down at National Front to boost run for presidency French voters choose change – but what type?

(Araya Diaz/WireImage/Getty Images via JTA) Writers Andrew Tobin Follow or contact: RSS Website Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Israeli Independence Day Gal Gadot Fauda JTA – To build a Jewish state in the Middle East, Israelis had to be innovators. Some of what they’ve come up with has been used mostly by their fellow citizens — think Hebrew slang, Bamba snacks and the Iron Dome missile defense system — at least so far. But many other Israeli creations have changed the world: drip irrigation, the USB flash drive and actress Natalie Portman, among them. Ahead of Yom Haatzmaut — Israel’s Independence Day, to be celebrated on May 2 — here are some incredible things Israel gave the world this year, its 69th year of independence. A weed inhaler Syqe Medical’s cannabis inhaler. (Courtesy of Syqe Medical via JTA) Puff, puff, pass the inhaler. In November, the Israeli pharmaceutical giant Teva announced it would begin marketing a medical cannabis inhaler in Israel that delivers precise doses of the drug. Rambam Hospital in Haifa had already been using the device for more than a year, making it the first medical center in the world to prescribe cannabis as a standard medical treatment. Perry Davidson, the founder and CEO of Syqe Medical, which developed the inhaler, said his company plans eventually to offer it around the world. “Israel is clearly just the start,” he told Bloomberg. “We expect to be approved for use in other countries in due course. The US, as the biggest medical cannabis market, is an obvious target.” The inhaler is far from Israel’s first marijuana-related innovation. In 1964, Raphael Mechoulan, a chemist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discovered tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis. He went on to identify the endocannabinoid system upon which cannabinoids act on the body. Last summer, the government approved a plan by Health Minister Yaakov Litzman to relax some requirements for obtaining medical cannabis. And in March, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan announced the effective decriminalization of private recreational marijuana use. A binge-worthy series on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict The cast of “Fauda.” (Ohad Romano via JTA) The Israeli TV drama “Fauda” has given the world a compelling look inside the conflict at the heart of the Jewish state. Nearly two years after the show became a mega-hit in Israel, Netflix in December began streaming the first, and so far only season, in 130 countries. In the United States and elsewhere, English subtitles were added over the Arabic and Hebrew dialogue. “Fauda” – Arabic for “chaos” – was informed by the Israeli military experiences of co-writers Avi Issacharoff and Lior Raz. The show follows undercover Israeli soldiers as they pursue a fictional Hamas terrorist in the West Bank and also delves deep into the lives of the Palestinian characters. Netflix previously bought the rights to other Israeli films and TV shows, including “Prisoners of War,” from which the hit US show “Homeland” was adapted. Reviewers and fans have lauded “Fauda” for offering an unusually complex and humane portrayal of Arab characters, even terrorists, and for capturing the reality of Palestinian life under Israeli rule and the challenges facing Israeli security forces. Loaded with Arab actors, the show has won fans on both sides of the Green Line that demarcates the territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. “A sad reality,” one Arab Israeli viewer wrote on the official “Fauda” Facebook page. “I hope the day will come when Arab and Jews can live together in peace.” A popular sport for middle-aged women A match at the Israeli catchball tournament in Kfar Saba, Feb. 21, 2017. (Courtesy of the Israel Catchball Association via JTA) Popularized by Israeli moms in 2005, the women’s sport of catchball has recently gone global. Catchball is like volleyball, but easier, because catching and throwing replaces bumping, setting and spiking. Israeli women adapted the sport from Newcomb, which some Americans may know from summer camp or gym class. Meanwhile, catchball leagues in Israel boast more than 12,000 female members, almost all of them over 30. That is twice as many adult women as belong to basketball, soccer, volleyball and tennis leagues combined, according to data from Israel’s Culture and Sport Ministry. “It’s like a disease among middle-aged women here,” said Naor Galili, the director-general of the Maccabi sports association in Israel. “We like it. We love it. We fully support it.” The Israeli Catchball Association in recent years has promoted catchball in more than half a dozen other countries and helped launch a sister association in the United States. At the July Maccabiah Games, an Olympics-style event for Jewish athletes held every four years, an exhibition tournament will feature dozens of teams from Israel, along with squads from Boston, London and Berlin. Richard Gere playing a Jewish schlub Richard Gere, a famously suave gentile, stars as a schlubby Jewish schemer in “Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer.” Perhaps only Israeli director Joseph Cedar could have given the world such a gift. The bitingly funny film follows Norman Oppenheimer as he aspires to serve as a fixer between New York’s Jewish community, into which Cedar was born, and Jerusalem, where he was raised. Cedar knowingly — and often humorously — navigates the gaps between the two worlds. As NPR’s pop culture critic John Powers put it, “Cedar cheerfully skewers Israeli politics and its emotional relationship to American Jewry in a way that US directors dare not.” The director doesn’t worry whether the film is “good for the Jews,” Powers noted. For better or worse, Gere apparently has no such hang-ups either. In Jerusalem last month for the local premiere of “Norman,” Gere told Haaretz that Israel’s settlements in the West Bank are “an absurd provocation” and “this occupation is destroying everyone.” Treatment for thousands of wounded Syrians Israeli soldiers treating wounded Syrians at the border, April 6, 2017. (Israel Defense Forces via JTA) Officially, Israel has maintained a policy of non-intervention in the Syrian war and has not taken in any refugees. But the Jewish state has still managed to offer some help to its northern neighbors. Since early 2013, the Israeli army has taken in some 3,000 wounded Syrians for treatment. Generally working at night, soldiers have provided initial medical care and then evacuated the wounded to nearby hospitals. The numbers are a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands who have been killed and wounded in the fighting between soldiers loyal to President Bashar Assad and rebel groups. But they are significant to those whose limbs and lives have been saved, including hundreds of children. During a visit this month to the Western Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, President Reuven Rivlin promised the country would “continue to do everything it can with responsibility and wisdom in order to alleviate the suffering of the people who experience daily slaughter here on the other side of the border.” Israeli civilians have donated hundreds of thousands of shekels to help Syrian refugees, and there has been official talk of accepting 100 orphans, though nothing has come of it. Self-driving cars Ziv Aviram, president and CEO of Mobileye, speaking at a conference in Jerusalem, Nov. 23, 2016. (Miriam Alster/Flash90) Your next car may very well come with an Israeli driver, though it won’t be human. The US chipmaker Intel last month bought Israel’s driverless technology company Mobileye for $15.3 billion, the largest-ever purchase of a high-tech company in this country. In a joint announcement, the companies said the deal “is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles.” Founded in 1999, Mobileye has supplied integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems — the building blocks for self-driving cars — to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. The company has already taken over 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Mobileye was a supplier of vision systems to Tesla until the companies broke up last summer after a man died in a crash while his Tesla Model S was on autopilot. Co-founder and CEO Ziv Aviram has said Mobileye, with its 660 employees, will remain centered in Israel, from where it will develop Intel’s first driverless car. A Wonder Woman with weapons training After first playing Wonder Woman in last year’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” Israeli actress Gal Gadot will appear in her own DC Comics film this summer. As a former Israeli soldier, Gadot has brought some unique skills to the role of Amazonian superhero. In March 2016, she talked to ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel about how her army service, saying, “The military gave me good training for Hollywood.” In her previous “Fast and Furious” appearances (in which she plays an ex-Mossad agent), the one-time Miss Israel impressed director Justin Lin with her knowledge of weapons and performed her own stunts for the franchise. She also showed off her fighting abilities in last year’s “Keeping Up with the Joneses” as the better half of a suburban secret agent couple. While Gadot’s films haven’t exactly been critically acclaimed, she has remained a national hero. Israelis have widely admired her for fulfilling her mandatory military service (while fellow Israeli swimsuit model Bar Refaeli has taken some heat for avoiding enlistment). Gadot is the first to play Wonder Woman on the big screen. Since superhero franchises never seem to end, Gadot — who has two daughters with husband Yaron Varsan, an Israeli real estate developer – is set to play the character in at least two more films this year.

Lawmakers suggest former Trump aide Flynn broke US law by: CHAD DAY and STEPHEN BRAUN, Associated Press Updated: Apr 25, 2017 - 7:29 PM Twtter WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said Tuesday. The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey's government. The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and Tuesday's announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said they saw no evidence that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, properly disclosed foreign payments he received to military officials or on his security clearance paperwork. Flynn, who headed the military's top intelligence agency, was Trump's national security adviser until he was fired in February. Among the payments in question was more than $33,000 that Flynn received in 2015 from the Russia Today television network, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia's government. "That money needs to be recovered," said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated as a retired Army officer to request permission from both the Defense and State departments about prospective foreign government payments before he received them. "There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law," Chaffetz said. Cummings said Flynn's failure to formally report the Russian payments on his security clearance paperwork amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said Flynn reported his plans to travel to Russia to his former agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he briefed officials there after he returned. Kelner declined to answer questions about whether Flynn properly disclosed the payments. The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by the Defense Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. But Cummings said the documents were "extremely troubling" and he urged the administration to declassify them. Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defense Department's inspector general for a final determination as to whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges and seek to recover the payments Flynn received. Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn's foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information, weren't relevant to the committee's investigation and could not be turned over. "That is simply unacceptable," Cummings said. At the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the committee's request for Flynn's security clearance information was referred to the Defense Department, which turned over documents. He said the White House did not release a detailed list of Flynn's contacts with foreign officials, a request he dismissed as "outlandish." Spicer said that the president was confident in his decision to fire Flynn in February on grounds that Flynn had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Spicer declined to say whether the White House believed Flynn had violated the law. He said the conduct occurred before Flynn was appointed national security adviser in January. Kelner, Flynn's attorney, said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. During his briefings, Flynn "answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip," Kelner said. A spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow "in accordance with standard security clearance procedures." A spokesman for Flynn has said that Flynn also disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. Chaffetz and Cummings said the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. Chaffetz added that while "it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied," he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. Both Cummings and Chaffetz said the committee's investigation into Flynn's foreign payments includes examining consulting work he did for a Turkish businessman last year. Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have principally benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In government filings, Flynn disclosed that he personally received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his stake in Flynn Intel Group, the company that performed the foreign agent work. Earlier Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn's firing. Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was canceled and has yet to be rescheduled. Some Democrats believe the White House wants to limit what Yates says publicly, but the White House has denied this. Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper is also to testify at the May 8 hearing. Also Tuesday, there were complaints that the Senate investigation was not moving quickly enough. Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California said they believed the committee needed to move at a faster rate. Preliminary interviews now have been completed with about 27 individuals from multiple intelligence agencies. And there are nine staffers working full-time on the investigation, according to one Senate aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity. By contrast, the House Select Committee on Benghazi employed more than 50 congressional staffers. The aide said the committee has gained access to additional materials at intelligence agencies, including categories and types of intelligence documents that have never been provided to Congress before. Committee members and staff are reviewing thousands of pages of materials at CIA headquarters and the National Security Agency. ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Apr 25, 2017 3:52 PM PT Credit: Mark Hachman More like this Microsoft: Go old-school to lock down Office from changes Zix wins 5-vendor email encryption shootout New Office 365 subscriptions for consumers plunged 62% in 2016 Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware Microsoft last week announced sweeping changes to Office's support rules, which will push more corporate customers to the Office 365 subscription model. The support policies introduced Thursday will cut in half the time that non-subscription versions of Office -- usually labeled "perpetual" as a nod to the licenses which, once purchased, let customers run the software as long as they want -- can connect to Microsoft cloud-based services. These include Microsoft-hosted Exchange email, the OneDrive for Business storage service and Skype for Business, the corporate edition of Microsoft's video-calling service. [ Further reading: Microsoft starts clock ticking on Office 2016's first upgrade ] Under the new rules, owners of perpetual-license versions of Office will be able to use those services only during the first half of their 10-year support lifecycle, the portion Microsoft dubs "mainstream." Currently, those customers may connect to cloud services such as Exchange mailboxes for the full decade of Microsoft's combined mainstream and "extended" support. For example, Office 2007 will exit its 10 years of support in October; as of October 31, "Outlook 2007 will be unable to connect to Office 365 mailboxes, which means Outlook 2007 clients using Office 365 will not be able to receive and send mail." Microsoft will enforce the changed requirements starting Oct. 13, 2020, said Ron Markezich, the executive who heads Office marketing, in a post to a company blog. As of that date, "Office 365 ProPlus or Office perpetual in mainstream support will be required to connect to Office 365 services," said Markezich. Office 365 ProPlus is the standard suite provided to enterprise customers who subscribe to Office 365 plans that include rights to the locally installed applications, including the $20-per-user-per-month Office 365 Enterprise E3 and the $35-per-user-per-month Enterprise E5. By the time the Oct. 13, 2020, date comes up on the calendar, all currently supported editions of perpetual Office -- Office 2010, Office 2013 and the newest, Office 2016 -- will have dropped out of mainstream support. (Office 2016's mainstream support will expire on that date.) The bottom line: If enterprises want to access Office 365's cloud-based services, they must 1) subscribe to a plan that includes ProPlus and, more importantly, install and use that constantly upgraded suite; or 2) pay for and install a perpetual-licensed version of Office every five or fewer years. Microsoft justified the change with much the same kind of explanations it's used for other big shifts in support, notably the mandate that older editions of Windows, including Windows 7, will not be supported on devices powered by the latest Intel and AMD processors. "When customers connect to Office 365 with a legacy version of Office, they're not enjoying all that the service has to offer," argued Alistair Speirs, a senior operations program manager, on another blog. "The IT security and reliability benefits and end-user experiences in the apps is limited to the features shipped at a point in time." Markezich went even further. After using the same explanation -- word for word -- as Speirs, he added to the bash-perpetual-Office campaign by trumpeting its rival, ProPlus. "When a modern app is connected to a modern service, magic happens," Markezich asserted. "What Microsoft's saying is that the Office 365 services won't work forever with [a perpetual-licensed Office], that eventually things will break," translated Wes Miller, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft. By changing the connect-to-services rules, Microsoft has taken aim at customers who have mixed cloud services with traditional perpetual -- or "stand-alone" -- software. Most enterprises, in fact, continue to use perpetual-licensed versions of Office, even as some have outsourced email to Microsoft by subscribing to lower-priced plans like the $5 per-user-per-month Office 365 Business Essentials or the $8 per-user-per-month Office 365 Enterprise E1. According to Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, many businesses have dipped into Office 365 sans ProPlus to cap costs. Some of those Microsoft customers "have saved some money for a while," Silver said, by sticking with an Office edition for six, seven, eight years -- or even longer -- rather than upgrade every three, the usual interval between perpetual-licensed versions. "Organizations have tried to moderate their costs for a while," Silver added of such firms. Under the new rules, that won't be possible, as companies will be able to run any given perpetual-licensed Office for no more than five years if they want to access cloud-based email hosted by Microsoft, or use the 1TB of OneDrive for Business storage space that comes with a Business Essential or E1 plan. Silver noted that while Microsoft's decision could be viewed as just one more shove to subscriptions, that wasn't surprising. "The writing has been on the wall," he said of the decline in emphasis of perpetual-licensed Office. As Silver implied, Microsoft has made no secret that it prefers subscriptions -- and not just for Office -- for the recurring revenue they generate. Companies will still be able to connect Office to on-premises services, such as an Exchange server, as long as they like under the new rules, Miller and Silver both pointed out. And enterprises that prefer to acquire Office as perpetual-licensed software won't be barred from that either: Microsoft has already pledged to produce a successor to Office 2016 that would connect to cloud services after October 2020. But the policy revisions will affect Office users. "This is going to be an issue" for some corporate customers, Silver said, as they transition from the essentially-static, perpetual-licensed Office to the upgraded-twice-a-year ProPlus. "It can be a difficult transition to manage."

A filing Apple made with the California Department of Motor Vehicles has disclosed the names of the Apple engineers who are leading the company’s self-driving car efforts. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm | UPDATED: April 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm Top of the Order:   So, THAT’s Who’s Behind the Wheel: Well, sort of, anyway. Because we are talking about self-driving cars here. In this case, we’re talking about self-driving cars and Apple, a company so notorious for privacy that it’s amazing it even admitted it was building its 2.8 million-square-foot Apple Park campus, even when drones could buzz the place and take photos of it from on high.

And why not? The company is always looking for the next big thing. And with everyone from Google to Uber (which is also working on flying cars) and Nvidia getting in on the self-driving car game in some fashion, it should come as no surprise that Apple would want a piece of that action. What it certainly didn’t want was for the names of those who are helping Apple build a self-driving car to become public, at least not until Apple was good and ready to do so. But, thanks to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, we all now know who’s behind Apple’s self-driving car program. And, in a humorous twist on the old joke: In many cases, you do need to be a rocket scientist to build one of Apple’s autonomous cars. Business Insider reported that, courtesy of a public records request, it got ahold of DMV documents that show who Apple has hired for its self-driving car initiative. The team includes Shilpa Gulati, a former NASA engineer who helped the space agency develop a self-driving underwater vehicle that could be used to investigate other planetary bodies; former Tesla engineer David Gadda; Paul Hebert, a former engineer of robotics at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; David Rosas, who holds a doctorate in control systems; as well as Apple engineers Victor Hwang and Jeremy Ma, both of whom also used to work on robotics at the JPL. Some of the team members are described as “autonomous vehicle driver/engineers” in the documentation. The reason why the DMV had all the previously top-secret names of Apple’s self-driving car team members was because the company had to file with the department to get permits for testing self-driving cars on California roads. Now, the DMV will know where to send the self-driving car’s annual license-tab fee notices. Middle Innings: Onward and Upward: It was a milestone day for the Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday, as the tech-heavy stock market gauge rose past the 6,000-point mark for the first time. By the time the stock market closed, the Nasdaq had gained 0.7 percent to end the day at 6,025.49. Investors have rallied around stocks this year, as mostly upbeat earnings reports, and a pledge by President Donald Trump to cut corporate tax rates, have helped boost company share prices. Among the big-name Bay Area businesses that make up the Nasdaq are Apple (which at almost 12 percent of the Nasdaq’s weighting is the index’s single-largest component), Facebook, Google parent company Alphabet, Cisco Systems and Intel. Cashing Out: Sometimes, you actually do win for losing. And it looks like Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer is going to win big whenever she loses her job at the one-time internet kingpin. A regulatory filing on Monday said if, and most likely when, Mayer leaves Yahoo after Verizon completes its $4.5 billion acquisition of the company, she will head out the door with $186 million in compensation, mostly in the form of Yahoo shares, stock options and restricted-stock units. If your jaw is still on the floor after reading that, don’t feel bad. It kind of makes the $25 million the San Francisco 49ers owed head coach Chip Kelly after the team fired him following its 2-14 season last year look like a pretty good deal, in retrospect. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Tuesday. Movin’ on Up: Netflix shares climbed 6 percent to close at $152.16 after the company said it reached a deal to stream original content in China via a licensing deal with iQiyi.com, one of China’s biggest video-streaming services. Gains also came from Aviat Networks, Ultra Clean Holdings, Genomic Health and Nektar Therapeutics. In the Red: Decliners included Rocket Fuel, Rambus, Cadence Design Systems, 8×8 and Sanmina. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index, as stated earlier, rose 0.7 percent to a record-high close of 6,025.49. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 1.1 percent to 20,996.12. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6 percent to finish the day at 2,388.61. Quote of the Day: “It’s a completely untapped market with huge opportunity.” — Bradley Tusk, CEO and founder of Tusk Ventures. Tusk, who is an investor in San Francisco-based marijuana-delivery company Eaze, was speaking about how venture capital firms are looking more and more at investing in the pot industry.

Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:51pm That's it for Markets Live today. Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:36pm Anticipation of US corporate tax cuts combined with strong European leads in the wake of the French election to send the ASX pushing strongly higher on Wednesday.  In broad-based gains, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.7 per cent, to 5912.0, having traded as high as 59239 shortly after the open, while the broader All Ordinaries index rose 0.6 per cent to 5936.8. The market is eying the 6000 level on the benchmark index. Tonight US President Donald Trump is expected to outline his tax plans, which could give Australian equities another boost.  Katana Asset Management portfolio manager Romano Sala Tenna said the market was one solid day's trading away from the level. But it would take a robust plan to get there. "There's a level of optimism built into the indices," he said. "Now things need to go right to maintain these levels. We need to see some follow-through on the Trump tax trade. "Our view is there's a higher probability of it succeeding than otherwise, but there's no guarantee." Financial stocks were responsible for most of Wednesday's solid showing. the big four banks rose between 0.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent. Macquarie Bank also saw some love, rising 2.6 per cent.  Heavyweight mining stocks did their bit, with the exception of the gold miners who suffered as investors dumped safe havens for more cyclical asset classes. Rio Tinto rose 1.1 per cent, Fortescue pushed up 1.3 per cent, while BHP Billiton added 0.6 per cent. BHP's strong showing came despite it being cut to a sell at Goldman Sachs, and it lowering its production guidance across several commodities in its third-quarter update, said Mr Sala Tenna. "The market was well-guided and well-versed in advance of the result, which is why they're up," he said. Meanwhile, another miner, Independence Group, was punished 3.4 per cent after a disappointing quarterly result. "They did miss where the market thought they'd be at," said Mr Sala Tenna. Bluechips posted solid gains. CSL was up 1.2 per cent, Telstra rose 0.7 per cent, and Woolworths and Wesfarmers rose 1.2 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.  Falling heavily were the gold miners, after the price of spot gold fell 1 per cent to $US1264.44 on Tuesday. Regis Resources, Newcrest Mining, Northern Star Resources were down 6.5 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 7.0 per cent respectively.  A2 Milk Company rose 7.7 per cent to $3.20, an all-time high, after raising its full-year revenue guidance on strong sales. Best and worst in the ASX 200 today. Photo: Bloomberg 4:09pm Well here's an odd thing: copper is anti-bacterial. Yes, the metal. Here are Bernstein metals and mining analysts Paul Gait & co: Healthcare-associated infections kill more people in the US than diabetes and prostate cancer together. According to the UK government, superbugs could kill 10 million people across the world by 2050 (more than cancer), for an estimated cost of US$100 trillion. What does it have to do with mining? It happens that copper has been identified as a serial bacteria killer. Evidence shows that copper is particularly efficient at killing six superbugs, including MRSA, E. coli and VRE, and is even being investigated in the prevention of the Ebola virus! Studies and trials have shown that bacteria die on copper surfaces in less than two hours, while they thrive for days (even weeks!) on stainless steel. There has therefore been an increasing awareness of the role that copper could play in preventing infections, and a handful number of hospitals (for now) have been replacing plastic and stainless steel infrastructure with copper-coated equipment. There is obviously a higher associated cost of using copper, but it is more than offset by the cost savings from the prevented infections. The payback period is generally a matter of weeks. In this note, we dimension the impact that this source of demand could have on the copper market. While the overall magnitude of the copper demand involved here (from hospitals only) is not huge, this highlights, once again, the importance of ever-wider sources of incremental demand, for a metal whose unique set of physical and chemical properties have long underpinned its use. While the direct use in hospitals may be modest, the bigger issue would be the adoption of antimicrobial copper in other public spaces (schools, public transportation, gyms, etc.) and eventually in the domestic use. Using copper equipment could help in the fight against the Ebola virus. Photo: CSIRO 3:53pm While everything looks tickety-boo on the Wall St, those killjoys at Societe Generale are pointing out that US corporate debt is very high. Here's SG's Andrew Lapthorne: Regular readers will know will have been flagging the US debt issue for a long-time, but for many it is the dog that refuses to bark. But with the IMF in its latest Global Financial Stability report joining the ever increasing list of organisations to be very worried about US corporate leverage (see the US Office of Financial Stability reports for others), the US corporate debt bubble is likely to regain centre stage. The problem the US now faces is it has to normalise interest rates, but with the smallest 50% of companies already spending 30% of profits (and at peak EBIT) on interest rate costs, any move upwards is likely to push up interest costs to dangerous levels. If EBIT was also to fall as a consequence, a large number of US companies could quickly find themselves in trouble. But if you fail to normalise rates, what is going to stop US corporates taking on even more debt?  Investors should be more worried about the US corporate debt bubble, SG analysts say. Photo: Societe Generale 3:38pm Global accessories company Furla Group is eyeing OrotonGroup's leading share of the Australian handbag market after buying back distribution rights from the Luxury Retail Group. After opening 15 Furla stores in three years and lifting sales in Australia and New Zealand by 95 per cent in 2016 to around $30 million, Furla and Luxury Retail Group plan to open another four or five stores in the next year. Luxury Retail Group managing director Nelson Mair says Furla sees scope for about 25 stores and is aiming to more than double sales over the next few years, taking on Michael Kors, Coach and Oroton, whose sales have come under pressure in recent years. "We do covet the position of being the leading premium brand in this space," Mr Mair said. "We think we can beat Oroton in terms of revenues on 25 sites," said Mr Mair, saying Furla's sales per square metre were high by Australian and global standards and the brand was popular with cashed-up Asian tourists as well as Australian consumers. "We do see a lot of opportunities to broaden the customer base." Furla Group said  in Milan overnight that it would buy back its Australian distribution network from the Luxury Retail Group, which also has the Australian distribution rights for Balenciaga, premium accessories and jewellery brand Folli Follie and operates footwear chain Sneakerboy. ​Under the terms of the deal, which were not disclosed, Luxury Retail Group will continue to support Furla under a service agreement for the next three years. Mr Mair, founder of upmarket menswear brand Rhodes & Beckett, and LRG partner Theo Poulakis, a co-founder of Harrolds, will remain on Furla Australia's board and will continue to oversee expansion in Australia and New Zealand. "The Australian market is very important for Furla and crucial in our expansion plan," said Furla Group chief executive Alberto Camerlengo. ​"Since 2013, Luxury Retail Group has been the best key partner to work with as it perfectly embodies the Furla vision, values and DNA. This is the reason why the two LRG directors will remain as board members of Furla Australia." Furla wants to challenge Oroton in the Australia. Photo: Supplied Back to top 3:14pm Here's an interesting piece from the AFR: Australia should halve immigration and undertake a massive transport infrastructure program funded with money effectively "created" by the Reserve Bank of Australia, says former NSW Treasury secretary Percy Allan. The radical version of quantitative easing, which would challenge long-standing Reserve Bank opposition against the use of what many have called "helicopter money", would fix housing affordability, improve productivity and ease inequality caused by years of ultra-low interest rates around the world, Professor Allan says. Warning that Australia's economy is rapidly running out of growth engines as the housing construction boom matures, Professor Allan says a key benefit of adopting a local version of quantitative easing, or money printing, for public works would be to ensure the currency falls below US65¢. That, in turn, would benefit the very sectors that are set to take up the slack from the waning property and resources booms – tourism, agriculture and education, all of which he argues are being hampered by the currency's current levels around US75¢. The remarks are part of an ongoing debate among policy makers over how to maintain Australia's quarter century of economic growth at a time when negative forces such as the ageing population, digital disruption and a tsunami of public and private sector debt threaten to kill off future living standards. In a letter to the editor and in an interview with The AFR, Professor Allan insists the only real policy options for Australia are to curb population growth and adopt a "cost-free" method of funding transport links within and between the big cities. He proposes having the federal government immediately slash skilled immigration from around 190,000 a year to 90,000, cooling annual population growth to 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent. "To avoid any racist overtones the humanitarian component should be expanded," he says. "Significantly slowing Australia's population growth would reduce pressure on house prices, city congestion and stagnant wages". Read more. "I am bearish. As the housing boom comes off we're going to have to go into a period where something else fills the gap," says Professor Percy Allan. Photo: Natalie Grono 2:47pm Asian stocks have extended a global rally after corporate results and hopes of US tax reform boosted optimism for global growth. Weakness in the yen have lifted Japanese equities for a fifth day. The MSCI Asia Pacific index has climbed to its highest level since mid-2015. The yen has extended losses. The Canadian dollar maintained losses following Donald Trump's decision to slap a 24 per cent tariff on imported softwood lumber. "Confidence has returned and the yen has fallen back in value," said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors. "Markets seem a lot more relaxed. Globally, we're seeing a lot of risk-on." Global equities jumped to an all-time high this month as European political risk abated and the US economy continues to show signs of improvement amid better-than-forecast earnings results. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil a tax plan tonight that would cut the upper corporate rate to 15 percent. Risks remain as investors await central bank meetings this week in Japan and Europe. Tensions around North Korea continue to simmer. And in China, concerns of a crackdown from regulators has left the world's second-largest stock market trading near a four-month low. Around the region: Japan's Topix index is up 0.9 per cent, climbing for a fifth straight day for the longest winning streak this year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.6 per cent New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 Index increases 1.4 per cent, the most since November South Korea's Kospi index climbs 0.4 per cent The Shanghai Composite Index adds 0.2 per cent after climbing a similar amount on Tuesday. Futures on the S&P 500 Index are flat. In commodities, gold is little changed at $US1264.44 an ounce, after dropping 1 per cent on Tuesday as investors turn attention to Trump's agenda to boost US growth. Crude has resumed declines ahead of US oil inventories data tonight, losing 0.2 per cent to $US49.45 per barrel, after halting a six-day sell0off on Tuesday.

While headline and core inflation is higher, JP Morgan's Ben Jarman sees evidence that Australia's weak inflation trajectory is further entrenched: The details of today's report also were negative. There is no verve in bellwether measures of inflation that tend to drive the cycle, with most inflation accounted for by oil, seasonality, and administered prices. Indeed the ABS measure of 'market prices ex-volatile items' printed inflation of 0%q/q, and 1.0%oya. The bottom-up drivers of a sustainable core inflation recovery are not at evident at this point. Further, the few supportive elements active in recent prints, fuel in particular, and also home-building, should not be contributing much more from here. This suggests that medium-term headwinds to the RBA hitting the inflation target remain significant. We see a genuine recovery in core inflation as a quite distant prospect, which biases the RBA to ease again. The timing on that will be dictated by how long it takes for distractions from the housing market to subside, and also the acuteness of the pressure from the labour market, which feeds into the RBA's mandate both directly ("welfare of the Australian people etc") and by dialing up the significance of today's inflation shortfall, from a capacity use and inflation expectations perspective. Meanwhile, Citi's Tony Brennan says the low inflation number "would be a worry", were it not for the more pressing worry surrounding the housing market: For the RBA its two main concerns are the subdued labour market and risks to financial stability. With these concerns pulling in different directions, we continue to expect no change in the cash rate this year. Any cash rate increase remains a distant possibility. We pencil in the first rate hike for Q4 2018 as the RBA seeks to move away from historically low interest rates only when there is a likelihood of trend growth that removes the negative output gap. It's those other worries - such as an overcoooked property market - that will push rates higher this year, TD Securities' Annette Beacher says: Mar quarter underlying inflation—the RBA's policy focus—rose from 1.5% to 1.8%/yr, but as some quarterly increases were less than expected there was an initial dovish market reaction. Taking a step back, however, core inflation of 1.8%/yr is off the floor and entirely consistent with RBA's February projection of 2%/yr by mid year. Our base case is for a rate hike by year end on urgent financial stability grounds and needing to attract offshore capital, not due to runaway inflation. However, seeing annual domestic inflation accelerate from 1.7% to mid-target 2.6%/yr over the past year gives us some comfort. Many of the components of the CPI are running below the bottom of the RBA's target band. Photo: JP Morgan 1:53pm Gold miners are getting pasted today in the rush back to the reflation trade. As investors bet on higher growth, inflation and rates - and as geopolitical risks are put on the backburner, at least in their minds - they don't feel the need to put their money into the precious metal. 1:29pm After a brief hiatus, the reflation trade is about to enter stage two, and Aussie investors should stay long this theme, Credit Suisse's Hasan Tevfik says. The reflation trade is a bet that inflation is set to pickup and has seen portfolio managers rotate into cyclical stocks, expecting upside should the global economy continue growing.  But in recent weeks US bond yields have slid 30 basis points since their March highs, iron ore has slumped 30 per cent and equity markets around the world have pulled back 2-5 per cent.  "However, we forecast reflation to return," says Mr Tevik, Australian equity strategist at Credit Suisse. "The global macro backdrop remains buoyant with solid growth in China and a continued recovery in the US. In Australia, we face the looming headwind of a housing downturn but do not think this will be as sharp a drag on corporate earnings as many fear." Foreign demand for housing, a modestly improving labour market and the recent boost in Australia's terms of trade bode well for a continued expansion in earnings and Mr Tevfik points to value stocks as the best corner of the market to scoop up the benefits.  These Australian fundamentals, combined with the promised tax-plan from the United States Trump administration, has given investors new hope that inflation will pick up and stimulate equities further still.  In the coming quarter, Credit Suisse expects rising earnings-per-share, rising index prices and falling price-to-earnings ratios to drive the earnings expansion in local equities. While there is some discussion surrounding the compression between "expensive" and "cheap" stocks, Mt Tevfik expects further to go. When the earnings expansion cycle began last September, commodities dominated the low price to book sectors while health care, industrials and technology were amongst the "high" group. "Our work suggests it is too early to take profits on the value-trade despite the considerable valuation compression over the last 6-9 months," says Mr Tevfik. "We continue to remain constructive on Aussie equities and stick to our ASX 200 target of 6000 by year-end. We highlight upside risks to our forecast." Read more. Photo: Credit Suisse Back to top 12:53pm Photo: Barclays And here are the economists weighing in on this morning's inflation data, with Capital Economics' Paul Dales abandoning his call for further rate cuts: The rise in underlying inflation in the first quarter, coupled with the RBA's financial stability concerns, dramatically reduces the chances of any further interest rate cuts. Our forecast that the RBA would cut interest rates from 1.5% to 1.0% this year was based on our view that underlying inflation would not rise as fast as the RBA expected. When taken together with the RBA's valid concerns that cutting interest rates further would threaten financial stability, today's data suggest that underlying inflation is now at a level that the RBA will be willing to tolerate  As such, we are no longer expecting the RBA to cut interest rates further. That said, price pressures and economic growth are not strong enough to warrant interest rate hikes. Interest rates are unlikely to rise above 1.5% this year or next year. AMP Capital's Shane Oliver remains of the view that a cut is more likely than a hike: ..out base case remains #RBA on hold but weak underlying inflation (& wages growth) still means more chance rate cut this year than a hike— Shane Oliver (@ShaneOliverAMP) April 26, 2017 CBA economist Michael Blythe thinks the low point for inflation might be behind us: The main message from the CPI is that inflation rates remain low ‑ but the low point is behind us.  And inflation rates will grind slowly higher from here.  The emphasis is on the "grind", however.  It is difficult to get concerned about inflation prospects when wages growth and labour costs remain very well contained.  Nevertheless, the housing component of the CPI may only add to RBA concerns about the housing market more broadly.  New dwelling purchase costs, closely correlated with house prices, was highlighted by the ABS as one of the most significant price rises in Q1.  The gap between headline and underlying inflation largely reflects high petrol prices.  Rising petrol prices (up 12.9% over the past two quarters) are now having a negative impact on consumer spending power.  In fact spending on areas that are largely outside consumer discretion (such as fuel, health, insurance, utilities etc) is on the rise (up 1.6% in QI and 4.2% over the past year).  Trends in this "pain spend" influence household's perceptions of financial pressures, with a flow‑on to sentiment and spending appetite. Barclays's Rahul Bajoria reckons rates wil be higher in a little over a year's time: We think the RBA is likely to wait for CPI inflation to be consistently above 2% in the next 6-12 months before signalling a shift in its stance. We also believe that a stronger nominal and real GDP growth path should result in employment continuing to improve, working hours being extended and aggregate wage bills rising. We forecast the hiking cycle to begin with a 25bp rate increase at the May 2018 MPC meeting, followed by two more hikes, of 25bp each, at the August and November 2018 meetings 12:38pm "We recommend investors sell into the bid..." They're the fateful words from Macquarie research analysts this morning, who reckon Spotless shareholders should take the $1.15 a share on offer from Downer EDI.  "SPO's main defence is now around base business performance and to this end it will provide FY17 and FY18 guidance as part of Target statement to be released on 27 April," the analysts said. "We are at lower end of SPO's $80-90m FY guidance (reported basis) and forecast 13% eps growth in FY18."  It comes after Spotless revealed a global facilities services company had spent three weeks inside the cleaning and catering company, however failed to come up with a binding bid. So with the rival bidder gone, Macquarie said Spotless had one less form of defence.  It means all eyes are now on Spotless' target statement, due on Thursday, and acceptances into Downer's offer which is scheduled to close on May 15. "From a DOW [Downer] perspective, the risk is now that the SPO offer becomes protracted and that it doesn't gain full control given a lack of SPO board support," the analysts said.  "At the same time, we see it as unlikely that DOW raises its bid given an absence of another acquirer, 59% initial bid premium and underwhelming reaction to its SPO offer."  12:29pm Cricket Australia is facing a major revenue crisis after global investment bank UBS urged broadcast partner Nine to axe cricket coverage because the network is losing up to $40 million every year televising the sport. Nine has broadcast cricket every summer since Kerry Packer famously bid for the sport in the late 1970s, and is renegotiating for 2018-2023 broadcast rights. UBS media analyst Eric Choi believes Nine Entertainment Co should walk away from negotiations if Cricket Australia's price is too high. "The existing cricket deal costs Nine circa $100 million per annum," he wrote in a note to clients. "We estimate the existing deal likely only generates gross revenues of $60-$70 million." "We think it would seem logical for Nine to enter negotiations with the following mindset: i) More cricket content at no additional cost, or ii) to step away from the cricket contract." A lack of a competitive bidding process for the TV rights would be a disaster for Cricket Australia, and comes as the sport attempts to re-sign all its major sponsorship contracts over the next 24 months. CA has already lost Victoria Bitter, and Commonwealth Bank is believed to have drastically cut its sponsorship from about $13 million to just $4 million. And KFC, which has been a major partner since 2003, will be renegotiating its sponsorship deal at the end of next year. In addition, CA is in tough pay negotiations with cricketers, with an existing pay deal expiring on June 30. Ben Amarfio, CA's executive general manager for broadcasting, digital media and commercial, said "very positive discussions" with Nine about the next cycle of media rights had begun. "We hope to begin formal discussions shortly," he said. "We are not concerned that there will be a lack of interest for our media rights. Live sport, and cricket in particular, continues to be a premium asset." Read more. Nine has held cricket broadcast rights for nearly forty years. But is it worth it as advertising dollars leave free-to-air television? Photo: Nine Network 12:18pm AFR companies editor James Thomson thinks BHP doth protest too much: This does not feel like your ordinary, run-of-the mill quarterly production report from BHP Billiton. Particularly when the commentary from chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, which is usually quite restrained and limited, starts with this statement: "Everything we do at BHP Billiton is designed to create value for all of our shareholders, today and for the long term." Mackenzie might not mention Elliott Management in his comments but the shadow of the US hedge fund that has so spectacularly demanded a series of governance and strategic changes of Mackenzie and the BHP board inevitably hangs over this report. And the shadow makes Mackenzie's statement feel like something of a riposte to billionaire Paul Singer, the man behind Elliott. One reading might be: We know this company better than anyone and we're pulling every lever we can for shareholders. The attention-grabber from the report is news that BHP will again try to sell its gas-rich Fayetteville shale operations in Arkansas, as well as acreage in the southern part of its Hawkville operations. Elliott, notably, called for BHP to demerge its US petroleum assets as part of its manifesto. So there are two ways to read the new information BHP provided on Wednesday about the shale operations. Firstly, Mackenzie is making it clear that he and his team are looking for every possible way to monetise a shale business that has been a $US20 billion sore point for BHP shareholders for some time. But secondly, the shale news also suggests BHP is going to be even more forthright about sharing its thinking on the value that Mackenzie and his team are unlocking through the business – be that through growth options, productivity improvements or lower costs, which he says have now dropped 40 per cent. In this vein, BHP has notably added a section titled "Progress on our roadmap to grow shareholder value and returns" to this quarter's report. It runs through a host of initiatives, including the approval of the Mad Dog 2 oil project and the new conveyor in its Queensland coking coal operations, and productivity improvements in truck utilisation in the New South Wales coal fields. Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive officer of BHP Billiton, rejected Elliott's proposals. Photo: Patrick Hamilton 11:50am Here's what the Twitterati are saying. Not much excitement, it must be said: Petrol the big driver of inflation in the quarter...— Shane Wright (@swrightwestoz) April 26, 2017 Headline inflation up 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, to be 2.1 per cent higher over the year.

Cost of living squeeze...— Shane Wright (@swrightwestoz) April 26, 2017 Back to top 11:47am Headline inflation is back within the RBA's target band for the first time in two years, at 2.1 per cent over the year to March, according to ABS data. That's up from 1.5 per cent in the December quarter numbers, but below the 2.3 per cent consensus forecast. The consumer price index (CPI) added 0.5 per cent over the March quarter, below the 0.6 per cent expected by economists. Core inflation as measured by the trimmed mean, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy and which is the central bank's preferred measure of inflation, was 0.5 per cent over the quarter, in line with forecasts, while the annual reading moved to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent prior. Shares have got a little leg up on the data, while the Aussie dollar is off a touch. It was 75.45 US cents before the release, and is now around 75.2. 11:19am Ardent Leisure has replaced chief executive Deborah Thomas with former Nine Entertainment chief operating officer Simon Kelly a month after corporate raiders Gary Weiss and David Baffsky built up a stake in the troubled theme park and arcade operator. Mr Kelly will become chief operating officer and managing director on July 1, Ardent said this morning. Ms Thomas will take the roles of chief customer officer for the group and chief operating officer for its Australasian business. Under Ms Thomas's watch the company suffered a fatal accident at its Dreamworld, Queensland theme park in October and reported a weaker-than-expected performance at its US Main Event Entertainment business in February, The transition was initiated by Ms Thomas, after the completion of a review of the group's global growth strategy and following the divestment of its non‐core health club and marina assets, the company said. The company also said chief financial officer Richard Johnson had resigned to return to the UK and be with his family. Mr Johnson's resignation was "independent of the CEO transition," Ardent said. The appointment of Mr Kelly, who has also held senior executive roles at Goodman Fielder, Aristocrat Leisure and Virgin Australia, comes after the purchase of a 5.7 per cent stake in the company by Ariadne, the vehicle of Mr Weiss and Mr Baffsky. They bought into the company that shed more than one-fifth of its value on the day of its February interim results announcement and were thought to be pushing for management change. "We are pleased to announce this significant boost to our management team," Ardent chairman George Venardos said. "Simon, who will transition to the role over the next few months with the support of Deborah, brings to the group a wealth of experience in the management of multinational operations, financial control and the entertainment sector." Ardent shares are up 0.8 per cent at $2.02. Deborah Thomas has stepped down as CEO of Ardent Leisure. Photo: Louie Douvis 10:53am A2 Milk Company has confirmed that a strong start to June half sales will mean revenue for the full year will be much better than first anticipated. The upgrade means the company now expects sales for 2017 financial year will be $NZ525 million, well above the consensus of analysts on Bloomberg of sales of $NZ511 million. The company had said in February that it expected sales in the second half would be lower than those of the first, due to the timing of major sales events such as Singles Day in China. But in a statement this morning the company said "since the update provided on February 15, demand for a2 Platinum infant formula has exceeded a2's expectations. "Demand has been particularly strong in Australia, but also through the cross border e-commerce channel into China. The company confirms that for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, group revenue was NZ$388.5 million." A2 said it has been working closely with its infant formula manufacturer, Synlait Milk, to "uplift the production schedule for the remainder of FY17." A2 stock is trading at an all-time high, and has risen over 80 per cent in the past 12 months. It's up another 6 per cent this morning at $3.15. An upgrade has boosted A2 Milk shares even higher this morning.  10:45am Shares have followed through on their solid offshore lead, with banks leading the broad gains as the benchmark index builds for another assault on the elusive 6000-point mark. The ASX 200 is up 40 points, or 0.7 per cent, at 5914, as local investors take their cues to get back in. The Aussie is steady at 75.4 US cents ahead of inflation figures due in 45 minutes' time. CBA and ANZ are up 1.3 per cent, Westpac 1.1 per cent and NAB 0.9 per cent. Macquarie has been getting more love as it adds 2.2 per cent. Bluechips are flying in the broad uplift: CSL is up 1.1 per cent, Telstra 0.8 per cent and Woolies and Wesfarmers on either side of 0.5 per cent.

Winners and losers this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 10:02am Investors were breathing a sigh of relief that Donald Trump averted any immediate trade showdown with China, but disturbing signs are emerging of a new unlikely trade war between the United States and Canada. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced overnight the US will slap retroactive tariffs of up to 24 per cent on subsidised softwood lumber sold by its northern neighbour into the United States. Mr Trump said the "very big tariff" was due to "Canada being very rough" on the US. Canada immediately denounced the protectionist move as "unfair and punitive" and vowed to contest the decision. The surprise shift by the Trump administration against a close foreign ally suggests that optimists who were breathing a sigh of relief about Mr Trump tamping down his economic nationalism may have been premature. In the past week the Trump administration has also announced a sweeping investigation into whether the importation of foreign steel jeopardises US national security and would justify imposing tariffs against a broad range of countries. The President also lashed Canada last week for its dairy exports hurting the US milk and cheese industry in the neighbouring US state of Wisconsin. "It's a disgrace," Mr Trump said of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's dairy policies. Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2017 The three separate trade fights over softwood lumber, steel and dairy underline the risks that Mr Trump still poses to international trade. The billionaire President is also reportedly preparing to take an executive action against foreign aluminium. Mr Ross declared it had been a "bad week for US-Canada trade relations". Canada's dollar fell as much as 0.6 per cent to US73.6¢ on Wednesday. American Enterprise Institute scholar Derek Scissors said it was too early to dismiss the prospect of Mr Trump engaging in a broader trade conflict and predicted harsher US actions awaited China and other trading partners. "There is action coming and there is going to be changes such as tariffs and quotas," Mr Scissors said. "The US wants something of a correction but it does not want an outright trade conflict." The US will slap retroactive tariffs of up to 24 per cent on subsidised softwood lumber sold by its northern neighbour into the United States. Photo: Paul Chiasson Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

The White House is refusing to provide lawmakers with information and documents related to President Donald Trump's first national security adviser's security clearance and payments from organizations tied to the Russian and Turkish governments. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said Tuesday. The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey's government. The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and Tuesday's announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said they saw no evidence that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, properly disclosed foreign payments he received to military officials or on his security clearance paperwork. Flynn, who headed the military's top intelligence agency, was Trump's national security adviser until he was fired in February. Among the payments in question was more than $33,000 that Flynn received in 2015 from the Russia Today television network, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia's government. "That money needs to be recovered," said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated as a retired Army officer to request permission from both the Defence and State departments about prospective foreign government payments before he received them. "There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law," Chaffetz said. Cummings said Flynn's failure to formally report the Russian payments on his security clearance paperwork amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said Flynn reported his plans to travel to Russia to his former agency, the Defence Intelligence Agency, and he briefed officials there after he returned. Kelner declined to answer questions about whether Flynn properly disclosed the payments. The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by the Defence Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. But Cummings said the documents were "extremely troubling" and he urged the administration to declassify them. Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defence Department's inspector general for a final determination as to whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges and seek to recover the payments Flynn received. Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn's foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information, weren't relevant to the committee's investigation and could not be turned over. "That is simply unacceptable," Cummings said. At the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the committee's request for Flynn's security clearance information was referred to the Defence Department, which turned over documents. He said the White House did not release a detailed list of Flynn's contacts with foreign officials, a request he dismissed as "outlandish." Spicer said that the president was confident in his decision to fire Flynn in February on grounds that Flynn had misled the vice-president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Spicer declined to say whether the White House believed Flynn had violated the law. He said the conduct occurred before Flynn was appointed national security adviser in January. Kelner, Flynn's attorney, said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. During his briefings, Flynn "answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip," Kelner said. A spokesman for the Defence Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow "in accordance with standard security clearance procedures." A spokesman for Flynn has said that Flynn also disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. Chaffetz and Cummings said the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. Chaffetz added that while "it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied," he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. Both Cummings and Chaffetz said the committee's investigation into Flynn's foreign payments includes examining consulting work he did for a Turkish businessman last year. Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have principally benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In government filings, Flynn disclosed that he personally received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his stake in Flynn Intel Group, the company that performed the foreign agent work. Earlier Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn's firing. Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was cancelled and has yet to be rescheduled. Some Democrats believe the White House wants to limit what Yates says publicly, but the White House has denied this. Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper is also to testify at the May 8 hearing. Also Tuesday, there were complaints that the Senate investigation was not moving quickly enough. Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California said they believed the committee needed to move at a faster rate. Preliminary interviews now have been completed with about 27 individuals from multiple intelligence agencies. And there are nine staffers working full-time on the investigation, according to one Senate aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity. By contrast, the House Select Committee on Benghazi employed more than 50 congressional staffers. The aide said the committee has gained access to additional materials at intelligence agencies, including categories and types of intelligence documents that have never been provided to Congress before. Committee members and staff are reviewing thousands of pages of materials at CIA headquarters and the National Security Agency. ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Eileen Sullivan and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Bethea Nok-Noi Ricker | BDN Evidence markers and police tape remained Monday at an Ohio Street apartment building where a person was shot on Easter. By Nok-Noi Ricker, BDN Staff Posted April 25, 2017, at 7:30 p.m. BANGOR, Maine — Authorities on Tuesday continued to hunt for the suspect in the Easter shooting on Ohio Street, the day after it was revealed in court that a Lincoln woman drove him to Portland after the alleged homicide. Antoinne “Prince” Bethea, 40, of New Haven, Connecticut, is wanted in the April 16 fatal shooting of Terrance Durel Sr., 36, of New Orleans, Louisiana, and formerly Brewer. Police would not comment on whether detectives have left the state in search of Bethea, who has spent nearly a decade in Connecticut prisons. “It all relates to the investigation,” Bangor police Sgt. Tim Cotton said Tuesday. “I can’t comment on an active and ongoing homicide case.” The New Haven Police Department knows about the murder charges against Bethea and is keeping an eye out for him, according to Sgt. Karl Jacobson, Criminal Intel Unit supervisor. Lincoln resident Cindy McVicar was arrested Friday for allegedly interfering with the capture of Bethea. McVicar was charged with a felony because she “misled officers” about driving Bethea to Portland after the shooting, as well as her whereabouts once there, Assistant Attorney General Leane Zainea said. McVicar’s bail was set at $30,000 and she remained in jail on Tuesday evening, a Penobscot County Jail official said.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Woman allegedly attacks ex with sword, gets banned from Brewer Muslim Portlander says former boss taunted her with pork before firing her Coach accused of sexual abuse of a minor Lincoln woman drove Bangor murder fugitive to Portland Developer outbids Cook’s Lobster owner to buy historic Maine island wharf Why Maine should stop ignoring the growing number of men missing from work We’re jailing way more people who’ve been convicted of exactly nothing Wednesday, April 26, 2017: Every child deserves a shot, guns have no place on campus, climate change march Tuesday, April 25, 2017: Open primaries to independent voters, job training glass is half full Fighting the scourge of the social isolation of seniors High school baseball coaches adapting to new pitch limits UMaine women’s basketball freshman to join sister at Duquesne Husson men add forward; UMaine sophomore to DII program Kemble, Bangor outlast Brewer in pitchers’ duel Snowmobile crash victim wins PASS North stock car race #MAINE Snail-whispering Maine girl appears on NBC’s ‘Little Big Shots’ THE DAILY SIMMER New Bangor coffee shop aims to tap John Bapst student market MIKE TIPPING In town hall tirade, Gov.

FILE - In this Feb. 1, 2017 file photo, then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn speaks during the daily news briefing at the White House, in Washington. The White House is refusing to provide lawmakers with information and documents related to President Donald Trump's first national security adviser's security clearance and payments from organizations tied to the Russian and Turkish governments. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) 00000 WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said Tuesday. The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey’s government. The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and Tuesday’s announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said they saw no evidence that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, properly disclosed foreign payments he received to military officials or on his security clearance paperwork. Flynn, who headed the military’s top intelligence agency, was Trump’s national security adviser until he was fired in February. Among the payments in question was more than $33,000 that Flynn received in 2015 from the Russia Today television network, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia’s government. “That money needs to be recovered,” said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated as a retired Army officer to request permission from both the Defence and State departments about prospective foreign government payments before he received them. “There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law,” Chaffetz said. Cummings said Flynn’s failure to formally report the Russian payments on his security clearance paperwork amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, said Flynn reported his plans to travel to Russia to his former agency, the Defence Intelligence Agency, and he briefed officials there after he returned. Kelner declined to answer questions about whether Flynn properly disclosed the payments. The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by the Defence Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. But Cummings said the documents were “extremely troubling” and he urged the administration to declassify them. Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defence Department’s inspector general for a final determination as to whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges and seek to recover the payments Flynn received. Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn’s foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information, weren’t relevant to the committee’s investigation and could not be turned over. “That is simply unacceptable,” Cummings said. At the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the committee’s request for Flynn’s security clearance information was referred to the Defence Department, which turned over documents. He said the White House did not release a detailed list of Flynn’s contacts with foreign officials, a request he dismissed as “outlandish.” Spicer said that the president was confident in his decision to fire Flynn in February on grounds that Flynn had misled the vice-president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Spicer declined to say whether the White House believed Flynn had violated the law. He said the conduct occurred before Flynn was appointed national security adviser in January. Kelner, Flynn’s attorney, said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. During his briefings, Flynn “answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip,” Kelner said. A spokesman for the Defence Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow “in accordance with standard security clearance procedures.” A spokesman for Flynn has said that Flynn also disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. Chaffetz and Cummings said the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. Chaffetz added that while “it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied,” he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. Both Cummings and Chaffetz said the committee’s investigation into Flynn’s foreign payments includes examining consulting work he did for a Turkish businessman last year. Flynn’s firm registered as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have principally benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn’s client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey’s finance ministry. In government filings, Flynn disclosed that he personally received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his stake in Flynn Intel Group, the company that performed the foreign agent work. Earlier Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn’s firing. Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was cancelled and has yet to be rescheduled.

Bipartisan accusations say Flynn didn't disclose foreign payments Become a WIZM INSIDER - The latest news delivered to you each morning WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said Tuesday. The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey's government. The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and Tuesday's announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said they saw no evidence that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, properly disclosed foreign payments he received to military officials or on his security clearance paperwork. Flynn, who headed the military's top intelligence agency, was Trump's national security adviser until he was fired in February. Among the payments in question was more than $33,000 that Flynn received in 2015 from the Russia Today television network, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia's government. "That money needs to be recovered," said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. "You simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else." Cummings said Flynn's failure to formally report the Russian payments on his security clearance paperwork amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated to request permission from both the Defense and State departments about prospective foreign government payments. "There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law," Chaffetz said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said Flynn reported his plans to travel to Russia to his former agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he briefed officials there after he returned. Kelner declined to answer questions about whether Flynn properly disclosed the payments. The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by his former agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. But Cummings said the documents were "extremely troubling" and he urged the administration to declassify them. Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defense Department's inspector general for a final determination as to whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges and seek to recover the payments Flynn received. Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn's foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information and could not be turned over. "That is simply unacceptable," Cummings said. At the White House, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the committee's request for Flynn's security clearance information was referred to the Defense Department, which turned over documents. He said the White House did not release a detailed list of Flynn's contacts with foreign officials, a request he dismissed as "outlandish." Spicer said that the president was confident in his decision to fire Flynn in February on grounds that Flynn had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Spicer declined to say whether the White House believed Flynn had violated the law. He said the conduct occurred before Flynn was appointed national security adviser in January. Kelner, Flynn's attorney, said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. During his briefings, Flynn "answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip," Kelner said. A spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow "in accordance with standard security clearance procedures." A spokesman for Flynn previously said that Flynn disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. Chaffetz and Cummings said the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. Chaffetz added that while "it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied," he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. Both Cummings and Chaffetz said the committee's investigation into Flynn's foreign payments includes examining consulting work he did for a Turkish businessman last year. Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have principally benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In government filings, Flynn disclosed that he personally received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his stake in Flynn Intel Group, the company that performed the foreign agent work. Earlier Tuesday, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn's firing. Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was canceled and has yet to be rescheduled. Some Democrats believe the White House wants to limit what Yates says publicly, but the White House has denied this. Former National Intelligence Director James Clapper is also to testify at the May 8 hearing. Also Tuesday, there were complaints that the Senate investigation was not moving quickly enough. Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California said they believed the committee needed to move at a faster rate. There are nine staffers working full-time on the investigation, according to one Senate aide, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity. One recently hired staffer is a former lawyer for a U.S. intelligence agency. Preliminary interviews now have been completed with about 27 individuals from multiple intelligence agencies. By contrast, the House Select Committee on Benghazi employed more than 50 congressional staffers. The aide said the committee has gained access to additional materials at intelligence agencies, including categories and types of intelligence documents that have never been provided to Congress before. Committee members and staff are reviewing thousands of pages of materials at CIA headquarters and the National Security Agency.
