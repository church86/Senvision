Jon C. Ogg, 24/7 Wall St. 6:33 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 The New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) With 2016 behind us, some investors are looking backward to see what worked and what did not. With a 14% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this year, the more important issue to consider is what investors should expect for 2017. The Dow has been within 1% of 20,000 for several days now. What if the Dow actually manages to hit 22,000 in 2017? It may be far more possible than most investors might imagine. 24/7 Wall St. has evaluated many of the preliminary views for key companies and industries ahead. Regardless of which candidate voters favored, it is now very hard to find investors who do not view the markets more favorably and more pro-business with higher growth environment. After all, the 8.5% rally in the Dow since the Nov. 8 election is almost unprecedented and is too large to merely assign as a coincidence or as a relief rally. Investors have bought every major market pullback for about six years now, and the bull market is rapidly approaching eight years old. Investors are looking for value and overlooked growth, and they are even looking for upside in popular names that simply have more upside to run. It turns out that many of the 30 DJIA stocks have a consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters that calls for substantial upside in the next 12 months. And then investors get to add in the dividends as well. The pro-growth strategies laid out ahead have been a boom for infrastructure companies tied to all sides of major engineering projects and those that process or mine materials. Then there is a lower-regulation and higher-rate environment driving financials and cyclicals. And of course those companies ready to repatriate over $1 trillion in overseas cash are expected to face a much more reasonable corporate tax environment versus other countries. Before just assuming that Dow 20,000 will come and turn into 22,000, it is important to reflect on some real issues. Rallies of this magnitude are rarely, if ever, followed by a straight line higher. Many investors put off traditional year-end profit taking due to expecting lower capital gain taxes in 2017. Many Dow and S&P stocks are now also valued above or very close to their consensus analyst target prices. Many of the Trump-beneficiary stocks also have rallied to the point that much or all of the good news for 2017 already may have taken place. What if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected? Will the political infighting of the past decade continue ahead? Also, and sadly, analysts can simply end up being wrong. And we almost never hear about geopolitical risks right now. All of these are risks to the rally not facing a pullback. 24/7 Wall St. showed a preliminary bull-bear case for the Dow in 2016 at 19,700. The Dow was valued just above 19,200 on Dec. 6 when we first looked at a Dow 20,000+, and the Dow has now hit a high of 19,987 as of Dec. 29. Here are some of the key driving forces that could help the Dow Jones Industrial Average get closer to 22,000 in 2017. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs Group (GS) already has risen to above $240.00 in 2016, and the shares are up 32% just since Nov. 8. Its stock price has passed its $229.00 consensus analyst price target. One reason the Dow has outperformed the S&P 500 since the election is that the Dow’s price-weighted valuation (rather than market cap-weighted for other indexes) is dominated by Goldman Sachs’ 8.3% index weighting, almost three-times the average Dow stock’s weighting. It has accounted for close to one-fourth of the Dow’s post-election gain. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best CEOs of 2016 Some analysts see even more bright skies ahead for Goldman Sachs. Outside of the company landing two top positions in the upcoming administration, HSBC is calling for a $250 target and Deutsche Bank now has a $255 target. If lower regulation allows for more trading, Goldman Sachs’ profit history could dictate even better earnings and far more upside than its paltry 1% dividend yield. Apple Apple Inc. (AAPL) was last seen trading at close to $116, and its 52-week high is just $118.69. Apple’s consensus price target is now up at $132.00 and has climbed slowly higher for months. Apple’s 2% dividend yield could rise handily if the company repatriates its massive overseas cash sum of close to $200 billion, and Apple is valued at only about 11 times next year’s earnings estimate. Credit Suisse just on December 6 reiterated its Outperform rating and $150 price target for Apple with hopes of iPhone 8 super-cycle. Recent reports of the big product being an iPhone 7s in 2017 could jeopardize that, but Apple has the largest cash trove of all companies (by far) and it buys back large amounts of stock. Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $118.69, its market cap is $622 billion and its weighting of 4.03% in the Dow is ranked just 10th out of 30 index components. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has recovered to $30.22, and its consensus analyst target is $33.11. It also has close to a 3.4% dividend yield, and the company is a monster when it comes to buying back shares. Cisco shares are valued at 12 times forward earnings. They are still about 10% shy of its 2007 high, and the share price is still less than half of its all-time back in the tech bubble peak in 2000. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best (and Worst) Investments of 2016 The 52-week range here is $22.46 to $31.95, and the market cap is $153 billion. RBC just named it among the top tech picks for 2017 and the firm is calling for a $35 share price for Cisco. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has been a sleeper, but what if 2017 is the breakout year for the sugar-water giant? Its $41.46 share price is well shy of the consensus price target of $45.75, and the 3.4% dividend yield would imply north of 15% upside. The stock is valued at 20 times expected earnings per share. Despite being more dependent on sugary beverages than rival Pepsi, the reality is that Coca-Cola has been diversifying away from its name brand for years. The stock has been a sleeper for so long, and it mostly has been in a $39 to $44 trading band for the past three years. Coca-Cola still has global expansion opportunities and cost containment opportunities ahead, and it is possible that value investors will begin to focus on what may be a defensive stock with limited downside. Coca-Cola also has raised its dividend for more than 50 years and has a market value of close to $180 billion. Home Depot Home Depot Inc. (HD) has recovered to $134.08 as of December's end, and its consensus price target now has risen to $147. That and its 2% dividend yield would generate upside of over 10%. The stock is valued at 18 times expected earnings for next year. Home Depot ran into some issues after peaking in the summer. But weak consumer and a slowing in housing have now been replaced by a euphoric consumer and expectations for a strong housing market to continue. It seems hard for Home Depot to not participate in this retail and housing upside. Home Depot has a 52-week range of $109.62 to $139.00 and a market cap of $164 billion. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) were last seen trading at $36.30, and its consensus price target is now almost $40. Intel’s dividend yield is also close to 3%, and it is valued at less than 13 times 2017 earnings. 24/7 WALL ST. America's 25 Thriving Industries What has occurred is that the personal computer market finally has come back due to gaming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intel also has expanded well beyond desktops; it is deep in servers and the Internet of Things, and it is even a growing partner for many chip companies now. Intel’s market cap is $174 billion, and it has traded in 52-week range of $27.68 to $38.36. Nike Nike Inc. (NKE) was the worst stock of 2016, down 17% for the year. With shares last seen at nearly $51, the consensus price target is $62, and that implies 20% upside — with lots of room for its mere 1% dividend yield to grow, on top of share buybacks. Nike is the leader in the athletic apparel market and there have been concerns that “athleisure” has peaked. Brands like Under Armour, Adidas and Reebok also want their piece of Nike’s market. What is amazing about all the negativity here is that analysts expect Nike to grow sales to $41 billion in 2019 from about $32 billion in 2016, with earnings growth expected to be about 40% over the same period. What if everyone has been too negative here? Nike’s 52-week trading range is $49.01 to $68.19, and it has a market cap of $85 billion. Pfizer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) was trading at $32.35, and its consensus price target of $37.65 implies upside of 16.4%, even before considering a dividend yield of almost 4%. Pfizer shares are valued at only about 12 times forward earnings. 2016 has been a dud for Pfizer, with a gain of just 4%, versus a 16% gain so far for rival Merck. Pfizer had been torn in long-term efforts, like whether to move or acquire overseas, deciding if the restructuring would lead to a break-up, and deciding whether to sell some assets. There was also the overhang of political pricing pressure on drug prices. While cheap underperforming stocks are that way for a reason, what if Pfizer has become too cheap versus Merck, or what if it releases some unexpected news or makes a great acquisition in 2017? Pfizer’s market cap is $196 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $28.25 to $37.39. Procter & Gamble Last seen trading near $84, Procter & Gamble (PG) has a consensus analyst upside of $91.00. This is still almost 10% in implied upside, without even considering its 3% dividend yield. The consumer products giant has restructured and pared down its brands, but it is still valued at 19.5 times forward earnings. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years now. One issue is that it has faced is harder overseas sales comps due to that strong dollar, and it seems hard to imagine that the company can shrink its brands back into a growth company. Still, this is a company that remains quite friendly to shareholders. Perhaps its endless list of brands should just speak for itself. The 52-week range is $74.46 to $90.33, and its market cap is $225 billion, making the company larger than its top three consumer products peers in the United States combined. UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) was trading at $160.04, and the consensus price target has lifted to $179 now. This implies upside of 11%, before considering its 1.5% dividend yield. What is amazing about the expected upside is that UnitedHealth shares have risen almost 40% in 2016, and 13% of those gains have come since the election. The largest insurer of them all is valued at about 17 times expected 2017 earnings. Being a health insurer under Obamacare turned out to be fine for UnitedHealth, and now it seems that analysts have little fears around a Trump effort to replace Obamacare. It has vacated most exchange operations and is focused on the group market and other value-added opportunities. How the health insurer ultimately will be treated under a regime in which Obamacare gets dismantled remains to be seen. Still, even the lowest analyst price target would imply a 5% drop and the highest analyst target is $200. UnitedHealth has a market cap of over $150 billion, and its weighting is 5.5% of the Dow’s 30 components. Visa Visa Inc. (V) was last seen at $78.02, and it has a consensus price target of $94.20, for an implied upside of 20%. Its dividend yield of less than 1% could have exponential upside, as it is less than one-fourth of earnings. Visa could be a huge winner from repatriation efforts, and a strong consumer spending environment should allow it to ring the register as it wins each time there are credit card transactions. Visa shares are well off of prior highs, but it is still valued at almost 20 times forward earnings. Many investors think of Visa a financial powerhouse now that it is a newer Dow component, but Visa is actually a platform provider with massive room to boost its weak dividend. Still, every company under the sun seems to want a piece of payment technology, and that has weighed at least some on Visa’s dominance. If analysts are right, then Visa shares have pulled back too far from its 52-week high of $83.96. Its shares are actually down since the election, and they have risen less than 2% so far in 2016. Again, there are many circumstances that have to occur for this recent enthusiasm to last. It would only be prudent to expect that some of the typical year-end profit-taking being delayed into next year might bring some selling early on. And it is possible that the strength of the post-election rally has already borrowed from the 2017 upside. Many analysts are certain to update and issue more formal 2017 targets after the start of the year. The formal bull-bear case for 2017 has to be followed by policy and structural changes in Washington, D.C., and a return to more rapid economic growth. The Dow has risen about 8.5% since November 8 alone, and the year-to-date gains in 2016 have been just over 14%. For a relative value between these Dow stocks and the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 was last seen valued at 17.3 times expected 2017 earnings per share and at 18.7 times its 2016 estimated earnings per share. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Sat 1:00 PM 11,012 Views 70 Comments Share4 Tweet Email The driverless car called Snuber is test driven during a demonstration at the Seoul National University's campus in Seoul. Image: Ahn Young-joon JUST LIKE CREDIT cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves — such as who is responsible in the event of an accident — a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. “Data is the new oil,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said last month during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. “If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations,” Krzanich said. “If not, the car will stop.” Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. Alexa Source: Gene J. Puskar South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. “Where are you, where you stop, how often, what’s in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience,” Krzanich said. “What music you like, craft choices… that’s an opportunity as well.” He said Intel was investing €250 million into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximize profit. “If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) ‘Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,” Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns One question on many people’s mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” it will be possible to disconnect at some point. “Consumer privacy is an open question,” said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. “A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we’re getting value in return,” he added. “It’s the same trade-off with an autonomous car.” Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. “Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking,” Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. “Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again.” In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car’s functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges “will require the industry coming together and collaborating.” © – AFP 2016 Read: The new driverless Mercedes is mouth-watering, but is it the end of sports cars?

AVC VDENC Video Encoding Enabled For Intel Broxton & Kabylake Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 31 December 2016 at 07:34 AM EST. Add A Comment For those that don't recall, VDENC is a low-power, high-performance video encode engine added originally to Intel Skylake hardware. That aforelinked article covers the big benefits of using VDENC and the patches published earlier this year for enabling this Intel video encode engine on Linux. Patches have now hit VA-API for enabling VDENC on the newer Broxton and Kabylake hardware for supporting MPEG AVC videos. These latest patches are now in the intel-driver VA-API Git code if you are running Kabylake or Broxton hardware and looking for improved AVC video encode performance. It's also dependent upon some updated GuC/HuC patches.

The Best of CES 2016: Where Are They Now? By Eric Griffith December 30, 2016 10 Comments Each year at the Consumer Electronics Show we recognize the top products. Some of them go on to be the best of the year, while others never even make it to market. Here's how last year's winners fared. For 49 years, the Consumer Electronics Show has served to set the technology landscape of the year. Every January, our team of analysts scour 2.4 million square feet in the Las Vegas Convention Center, poking into every corner to determine the products that make it into our annual The Best of CES story. But making it into that story doesn't always mean that the products within make it. Sometimes, the "best" is just a proof of concept. Other times, it just doesn't get the backing needed to go all the way. And occasionally even if it gets out the door, it doesn't live up to that initial hype. But when a product does live up to it, it can be a game changer. Our analysts narrowed the thousands of options at CES down to just 18 top picks last year. Let's check in with all those winners and see just where they stand 12 months later, as we stare down the barrel of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas next week. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2016! Best Gaming Laptop Razer Blade Stealth We first fell in love with the Blade Stealth at CES for its top-notch build quality, sharp touch screen with QHD graphics, and stellar keyboard with individually backlit keys. In our review a couple of months after the show, we gave it 4 stars and an Editors' Choice award. That might have been enough for some companies, but Razer whipped out a brand-new Blade Stealth model in October, one upping the first review to get 4.5 stars. The new version has almost exactly the same body and specs, but now features chips from the latest Intel processor family ("Kaby Lake") and even better battery life (adding 2 hours to get to 9 hours, 20 minutes, in our tests). Best Business Laptop HP EliteBook Folio G1 (4K UHD) It would be impossible to look at the svelte HP EliteBook Folio G1 and not think of the Apple MacBook , but with all the attributes a business user needs. The G1 is only 2.36 pounds, has a 4K UHD display, an incredibly thin metal body, and USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 connectors. Plus, it has work-focused features like TPM and Intel vPro. However, what we liked at CES didn't hold up quite as well in testing. In our review, we appreciated those attributes, but also found the G1 wanting when it came to battery life (thanks to that high-end screen) and requiring too many dongles to use its ports. Still a good system, but only worth 3.5 stars. Best Convertible Hybrid Laptop Lenovo Yoga 900S At CES we found the Yoga 900S to be that special kind of hybrid that doesn't feel compromised when you flip it into tablet mode. Marketed as the thinnest convertible at 12.8mm thick with a weight of around 2 pounds, it was love at first sight, even if it lacked some of the power of the Yoga 900. Both use the watchband-inspired hinge (shown above) that allows you to lay the whole unit flat or flip the screen around back for Tablet mode. In our June review, however, we found it was a little too underpowered, with only 4GB or memory, and a little pricey for what it brings. It earned 4 stars, but no Editors' Choice award. Best Tablet Samsung Galaxy TabPro S At CES we were convinced the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S was the perfect answer for those who like the look of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 , but don't want to pay for it. After all, it packs a beautiful 12-inch 2,160-by-1,440 Super AMOLED screen with a Core m3 processor ready to run Windows 10. It even has a USB-C port and fingerprint sign-in. Our follow-up review in March showed that while it is indeed light, slim, and polished, and has a best-in-class battery life and a vivid screen, not all was perfect. The tablet lacks Thunderbolt compatibility on that USB-C port; you'll find no USB-C adapter, no other slots, and no stylus; and the Core m3 prevents the TabPro S from keeping up with other tablets that run on Core m7 and even Core i5 processors. It received a 3.5-star rating. Best Phone Huawei Honor 5X A $199.99 all-metal Android phone with a 5.5-inch screen and a fingerprint sensor on the back? At CES 2016, we pegged this intriguing phone to have such an incredible value it might force American carriers to open up wide to the world of unlocked smartphones on the cheap. It remains the best-looking unlocked phone you can get on a budget. In our review that same month, however, we experienced some performance issues. The result was a solid but unspectacular 3.5-star score. Best Fitness Wearable Fitbit Blaze Fitbit's Blaze was the only fitness tracker among a slew of them that really stood out at CES. Thinner than an Apple Watch or even the Fitbit Surge, the Blaze has a vibrant color touch screen, something seldom seen on fitness trackers today. But in what you may notice is a bit of a pattern, our eventual review couldn't muster more than a 3.5-star rating, since the Blaze isn't waterproof, lacks GPS, and just has an overall awkward design that needs tweaks. It's a solid choice if you're new to tracking, but it's no smartwatch. Best Health Wearable Mio Slice More than just a fitness tracker, the Mio Slice looks after your overall health, focusing on your PAI (Personal Activity Intelligence) score, an algorithm that links your cardiovascular health and heart rate. As long as the PAI on your device is over 100, you could live a good long time—and the Slice is the only Mio device that displays it up front (though other Mio devices like the Fuse and the Link will also support PAI, but only by looking it up in the smartphone app). That said: The Slice never shipped this year as planned in the US. It will reportedly start selling in January 2017 in Japan for 18,400 yen (approximately $157 USD). Best Smart Appliance Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator Samsung sells lots of refrigerator models, and has even sold some unimpressive smart fridges in the past, but at CES our analysts loved the look and the potential of the 22.1-cubic-foot-capacity Family Hub. One of the doors has an integrated 21.5-inch 1080p touch screen that not only can be a family message area, but also provides a unique interface into the contents of the appliance. Whenever the door closes, the Family Hub takes pictures of what's inside for you to annotate on the big screen (above), or access while at the store. Or you can use the screen to do your grocery shopping online. The fridge went on sale last July and prices are dropping from the proposed $6,000 start to well below $3,500 when you shop around at big-box stores. Best Television LG Signature OLED TV No screen wows the eyes more than one with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, and that's exactly what LG has brought to living rooms in the new Signature television line. At CES we were wowed by the 77-inch 77G6P. A sheet of glass that attaches to a speaker base and small electronic back, the TV measures only 3mm thick. We didn't test the 77-inch Signature, but we did get the 65-inch version 65G6P in April. And it earned one of the few perfect 5-star ratings we handed out in 2016. So imagine that perfection, but bigger, and that's the 77-inch version; it just happens to have a starting price of $19,999, or about 3 times that of the 65-inch. Best Home Theater Gear Dish Network Hopper 3 An unheard-of 16 tuners. That's what you get with the Hopper 3 , Dish Network's first 4K DVR. Not only can you record 16 shows at one time, in Sports Bar mode, you can view up to 4 HD channels simultaneously. We liked the Hopper 3 so much when we tested it in April, we named it our Editors' Choice for DVRs and gave it a perfect 5-star rating. Considering it's available as a free upgrade for qualifying Dish subscribers when coupled with a $15 monthly whole-home DVR fee (the same as the previous Hopper), it's a no-brainer upgrade for future-proofing your Dish service. Best Gaming Gear Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch It took years for the Oculus Rift to get a consumer release, but 2016 was that year. At CES, the Rift, coupled with the Touch motion controllers, were the best looking and most powerful virtual reality headset/controller combo we'd seen. We found that they provided an impressive VR experience when we tested them alongside the HTC Vive, but neither was quite on par with the Sony PlayStation VR. Still, the Rift received a strong 4-star rating and the Touch controllers earned a 4.5-star score. Best Drone Yuneec Typhoon H During CES we pegged the Typhoon H as the (somewhat) affordable alternative to other high-end drones. With the Typhoon H you get six rotors, a rotating 4K video camera, retractable landing gear, and obstacle avoidance provided by Intel RealSense tech. The problem we found in our October review is that the obstacle avoidance (which costs $600 extra) was a hindrance to the typical 30mph speed. In addition, the controller is unwieldy due to its size, and flight time is limited to 19 minutes on a full charge. We gave the Typhoon H 3.5 stars and continue to recommend less-expensive drones like the DJI Phantom 4 . Best Action Camera Nikon KeyMission 360 CES 2016 was full of GoPro clones, but none had the specs of Nikon's entry. The KeyMission 360 has dual lenses to capture all its surroundings in 4K—even if the surroundings are underwater (down to 100 feet). Sadly, our first real chance to test it in December showed that while it wields some other impressive specs (the ability to snap 29-megapixel stills, a Wi-Fi remote control, desktop software for Mac and Windows), it's not really a double for a traditional action camera. Battery life is short, file sizes are enormous, and the 4K is only 24 frames per second (fps). And you can't use it with a GoPro mount. The KeyMission 360 ended up with 3.5 stars. Best Digital Camera Nikon D500 The Nikon D500 debuted among many other cameras at CES 2016, many with higher prices and more features. But the D500 had the edge, sharing features with the higher-end D5 (such as a 153-point autofocus system, but with a smaller sensor that can take full advantage of the focus points—excellent for telephoto shots), rugged build quality, 4K video capability, 10fps focus and fire shots, and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It's always nice to see that initial feeling validated, as the D500 delivered in spades with a 4.5-star, Editors' Choice award-winning review in May. The D500 is serious competition for the Canon EOS 7D Mark II , which it replaced as Editors' Choice. Best 3D Printer Mcor ARKe At CES, we liked the Mcor ARKe for its aim of making low-cost, professional-class, photorealistic color 3D printing possible. The printer's Selective Deposition Lamination (SDL) technology actually binds together sheets of paper with adhesive to make long-lasting 3D models in full color. We haven't been sent a review unit to test, but you can find the ARKe for sale online. Best Car Faraday Future FFZERO1 The FFZERO1 is a concept car from Faraday Future, so you can't get one. But we can't apologize for picking it as the best car of CES 2016, as it made such a huge splash in Vegas that the ripples continue even now. The 1,000-horsepower, fully autonomous vehicle that's controlled by your smartphone continues to be pitted against other self-driving cars like the Tesla Model S P100D. You can get a closer look by downloading the Faraday Future Concept app for iOS or Android—it's probably as close as you'll ever actually get to one. Coming soon to CES 2017—Faraday Future's first actual production car! If the company can get to Vegas before running into insurmountable legal and financial problems. Best Concept LG Rollable OLED Display Nothing looks quite as futuristic as a bendable screen. And LG's flexible 18-inch OLED display is the best we've seen to date. Since it's 100 percent concept, you never had a chance of seeing it as a real product this year. However, LG claimed at CES that it would be able to make rollable Ultra HD OLED displays in 60-inch versions by 2017. Fingers crossed! Best Prototype Seven Dreamers' Laundroid The Laundroid is real: a refrigerator-sized cabinet that folds all the clothes you dump inside it. It's far too early to get one now, but the company has a deal with Panasonic to build the technology into washers and dryers by 2018. It might want to hurry—competition like FoldiMate is coming.

The first set of products with Kaby Lake-U were ultrabooks. However, ultra-compact form-factor (UCFF) PCs were not long behind. There are already three vendors in the market with Kaby Lake UCFF PCs - ASRock (Beebox-S), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi 2). MSI was the first to launch KBL-U UCFF PCs in the North American market under the Cubi 2 tag. This review focuses on the build and performance of the Cubi2-005B - the KBL-U UCFF PC from MSI featuring the Core i7-7500U. Introduction Ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) PCs have become quite popular after Intel introduced the NUCs. They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. In addition to the Intel NUCs, many system vendors have come up with their own approach to UCFF PCs. These include ASRock (with the Beebox series), ECS (LIVA), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi) amongst others. Kaby Lake-U, as per Intel's claims, is fabricated on a much more mature 14nm process and brings about a 11% improvement in performance for the same power consumption. The GPU's media engine has also been updated. On the whole, the performance improvements look good for UCFF PCs - particularly for those upgrading from the first or second-generation systems. MSI's take on the UCFF PC market with the Cubi an Cubi 2 is interesting from two perspectives - Rather than having separate SKUs for units with / without support for 2.5" drives (like the GIGABYTE BRIX) or compromising on the thickness of the system to include 2.5" drives (like the ASRock Beebox), MSI allows for interchangeable bottom plates. The default one doesn't come with 2.5" drive support and results in a system thickness of 3.7 cm (while the extension bay / thicker bottom plate version makes the system 4.9 cm thick). The extension bay is also included with the Cubi 2 package. The second aspect is that MSI is targeting the Cubi 2 towards effectiveness for the average consumer. While a M.2 NVMe SSD can do wonders in terms of performance, the reality is that the high-performance versions come in the M.2 2280 form-factor. Rather than sacrificing the size of the unit, MSI has decided only to have a M.2 2242 slot in the PC. Even though it is connected to the PCIe lanes from the PCH, we believe it is likely that consumers will be using M.2 2242 SATA SSDs in that slot, or, end up using a 2.5" drive with the extension bay. Similar to other UCFF PCs in the market, the Cubi 2 also comes in a version without memory or storage. The Cubi 2 can take up to two DDR4 SO-DIMMs (operating at 2133 MHz) and a 2.5" drive and/or a M.2 2242 SATA / PCIe SSD. We completed the hardware build to result in the following specifications for our MSI Cubi2-005B review configuration.

You mean Broadwell here instead of Kaby Lake, don't you? Reply ganeshts - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link bad typo, with the link in it correctly linking to the Q3 2016 article. It has been fixed. Reply Voldenuit - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link No tear down? Cooling system? System layout? Noise measurements? Reply Great_Scott - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link It doesn't really matter anyways. This kind of system is a waste of time: laptops have greater functionality for less price, and the same components. The U-series doesn't distinguish between the i5 and i7 beyond clock speeds. You can go to any site online and get a U-series laptop for ~$400 US that also includes RAM and Storage. Reply barleyguy - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link For an HTPC, a NUC or UCFF is a lot more convenient than a laptop. They generally have less fan noise, fit in less space, and boot up with the TV (or projector) as the primary monitor. (I'm typing this on a Zotac Z-Box in my living room.) That said, I'm really skeptical of the U-series processors in general. My Z-Box has an i5-4200u, and I've had some issues with throttling under load. Hopefully they've improved from the 4200u to the 7500u. Reply kmmatney - Monday, January 02, 2017 - link and the laptop will have an OS as well... Reply ganeshts - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link You guys are hard to please. In any case, this is a bog standard NUC, nothing special about it. Cooling system - all that matters is effectiveness, and I hope readers agree when I say that we have the most comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the cooling solution of mini-PCs in the review circuit. Look at the graphs in the 'Power Consumption and Thermal Performance' section. Noise measurement - we only do subjective eval in these reviews. Providing noise numbers for these types of PCs (i.e, non gaming mini-PCs) is pretty much useless because the noise floor is too high and these types of PCs are too quiet in our evaluation setup. Creating a noise measurement lab is not worth the investment for the number of PC reviews that I do per year. You can find dedicated guys like SPCR ( Silent PC Review - http://www.silentpcreview.com/ ) who fill that market niche with excellent reviews and articles. (I would imagine even they would not find the Cubi 2 and other similar PCs interesting enough to do noise measurements) Reply voicequal - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link I just spent 20 mins looking at the power & thermal charts. It's fascinating to see how the CPU & GPU clock respond to the shared 15W power and thermal budget of the integrated package. Time 1800-3600 shows how the GPU steals performance from the CPU, resulting in the CPU clock dropping to 1.2 GHz, far below the Core i7-7500U spec of 2.7 GHz. I've always thought it misleading to claim this a 15W 2.7GHz CPU, when this is only the case if GPU utilization is negligible. Reply Robalov - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link If it's same as cubi 1, the heat sink fan mounts are soldered onto the pcb. They're weak and fall off. The system will barely last to warranty and is difficult to repair. Reply Kakti - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link "We didn't evaluate 4K Netflix streaming on this PC because there is no HDCP 2.2 support." Intel really dropped the ball in regards to their Y and U chips not being able to decode HDCP 2.2 streams. Do we know if the 200-series chipset for LGA 1151 Kaby Lake processors will include native HDCP 2.2 support, or will it be the same story there?

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll focus on 3-4 broad areas of interest. We will work with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Products e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics Emerging Technologies e.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access People e.g. teamwork & collaboration; community-building; communications Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from general “TED”-like inspirational talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge. Host: Larissa Shapiro Questions: In advance submit questions here During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #mozSS Previous Speakers November 16: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation, with Ashley Good, Fail Forward Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, November 16 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation When you start a new job or project, you envision exciting things you and your team will accomplish together. When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014. Mozillian Host: Aurelia Moser Presentation deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | December 30, 2016 -- 19:04 GMT (11:04 PST) | Topic: Innovation Getty Images/iStockphoto With 2016 drawing to a close, here is a look at some of the things -- tech, as well as a number of industry metrics -- that you should be keeping an eye on over the coming year. CES thoughts What's Hot on ZDNet The future of robotics: 10 predictions for 2017 and beyond White House AI report calls for 'aggressive' policies to help workers Encryption backdoors are against US national interest, say lawmakers DIY-IT: Top 10 how-to articles of 2016 Before I begin, I want to mention the first big tech shindig of 2017, which will be CES. I pay very little attention to CES these days, not because there isn't some interesting stuff demonstrated there, but because it's a pretty poor indicator of what's going to be important throughout the year. Also, a lot of stuff is unveiled at CES that never seems to see light of day, so it's easy to get distracted by stuff that you'll never see again. With that out of the way, here's what I think you should be paying attention to over the coming year. iPhone 8 (or whatever it will end up being called) The iPhone 8 will be Apple's tenth-anniversary smartphone, and it's expected to offer a big sales hurrah before sales start going weak again. How Apple approaches and handles this launch -- and whether it can create a situation where supply meets demand, especially during the first few weeks -- will be critical. PC sales Will there be a rebound in sales occur as the long-awaited upgrade cycle kicks in, or has the rot set in to such a point that the recovery is never going to happen? Can new form factors shift the needle in any meaningful way? Intel vs. AMD AMD has, for perhaps the first time in a couple of decades, some interesting silicon that could give the company an edge over Intel. But it remains to be seen whether AMD's Ryzen has what it takes in the real world to gain the edge over Intel's Kaby Lake. Will there be an iPhone SE 2? Will Apple update the low-cost 4-inch iPhone during 2017, or will it allow it to mature for another year or so in the hopes of preventing it from cannibalizing sales of higher-priced iPhones? This will be an interesting test of Apple's courage. What about a "Made in the US" iPhone? President-elect Donald Trump pledged that he would "get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China," and now he's put this to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Problem is, not only would it be hugely complex to move the manufacturing operating to the US, but could add significantly to the cost. iPad Will the iPad Air and iPad mini lineup get a refresh, or is the iPad Pro the way forward now? Also, can Apple do anything to make sales pull up from their decline or is iPad headed for irrelevance? iPad sales are already at their lowest since 2011, so things aren't looking good. iMac and Mac Pro Will they get a long-overdue refresh, or is Apple going to allow them to wither on the vine? Apple's high-performance Mac Pro is now three years old, which in tech terms is eons. Are these just low-selling distractions from the iPhone? Surface Studio This was a big, bold, innovative move from Microsoft, so it will be interesting to see whether we get any real sales data, and whether there will be a refresh towards the end of the year. Can Microsoft bring more innovation to the table? Surface Phone Can Microsoft get back into the smartphone game, and this time make it work, or is it too late to enter the fray given the size of Android and iOS? Hardware hits such as the Surface Studio and Surface Book show Microsoft can innovate, and "Windows 10 on Qualcomm" makes it clear that Redmond sees unification of desktop, tablet, and smartphone operating systems is the way forward. But the market is a fickle one, and Apple and the Android gang currently have the sales channels pretty much to themselves. Can Samsung put the Galaxy Note 7 behind them? The Galaxy Note 7 fires were a huge blow for Samsung. It might be the Android maker that's pulling in the most dollars, but in an attempt to make the Note 7 as thin as possible, the company pushed the envelope of what was possible to do safely. Smartglasses Can Apple make a success of smartglasses when Google failed? The failure -- at least consumer failure -- of Google's Glass project will no doubt be at the forefront of Apple's mind if it's planning to venture into this area. Will all the Android players survive? There's almost no money in making Android handsets. While low prices and razor-thin margins are good for consumers, it's bad for the hardware makers. 2017 could see players -- especially the ones that are losing money -- exit the game. So long, 3.5mm headphone jack Now that Apple has dropped the headphone jack from the iPhone, expect others to follow suit in 2017.

As 2016 draws to a close, we asked five Intel leaders, many new to the company, for their thoughts on these tech trends that will shape the future of Intel and our industry. Here are some of their insights: In 2017, AI-powered systems will go from exploration to adoption in the enterprise The digitization of nearly everything has produced mountains of data. More data than human beings can consume, synthesize and put to use. But, with artificial intelligence technologies (cognitive computing and deep learning, as examples), were gaining the ability to more effectively understand, interpret and act on all that information. Gayle Sheppard, who joined Intel with the acquisition of cognitive computing company Saffron Technology, believes 2017 will be the year that AI-enabled decision systems move from exploration to enterprise adoption across a variety of industries. Saffron unifies what Sheppard calls more chaotic, unstructured data with manicured enterprise data to surface insights from patterns impossible to see before. This capability helps industries such as financial services improve the detection and prevention of fraud or helps retailers individualize product recommendations to achieve better outcomes for their customers. Artificial intelligence, she said, will ultimately give all of us intelligent assistants for our professional and personal lives. With AI we have the opportunity to move beyond traditional thinking about decision-support systems to build systems that see, hear, understand and collaborate with us to help make decisions faster, more relevant and better informed.   Gayle Sheppard, general manager of Saffron Technology 3-D collaboration will emerge as a driving use case for AR/VR Today, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) are most commonly associated with gaming or entertainment. While these uses will undoubtedly gain in popularity, another potential killer app for AR and VR has more in common with the rise of spreadsheets, word processing and e-mail. According to Remi El-Ouazzane, chief executive of Movidius, a company Intel acquired in 2016, workplace collaboration is likely to propel the adoption of augmented reality (or what Intel calls merged reality). Companies today are bound by two-dimensional collaboration, El-Ouazzane said. But, with merged reality, you immerse yourself in an environment where, for example, engineers at different sites around the world could walk around an engine, working together as if physically in the same place at the same time. To get us there, computers will need to process visuals with the speed and accuracy of the human eye. Thats where Movidius comes in. The company was founded with the bold vision of giving sight to machines. Its leading vision processing unit combined with Intel® RealSense depth-sensing technology is a powerful combination toward realizing that vision. In merged reality, we are confronting two worlds, the actual world we can see with our eyes and a computer-generated world. The display where those synthetic elements are rendered needs to be good enough for your brain to accept them as being real, said El-Ouazzane. Augmented reality is nothing less than tricking the brain to believe that synthetic elements and real elements can coexist.  Remi El-Ouazzane, chief executive of Movidius, an Intel company Function will overtake form in automotive Intel is dedicated to transforming the future of driving and designing the next generation of advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving solutions. Intels General Manager of the Automated Driving Solutions Division, Kathy Winter, joined Intel from Delphi where, in 2015, she was credited with achieving the first cross-country drive by an autonomous vehicle. In 2017, she expects more autonomous cars on the road, gathering data to pave the way for the broad adoption of safe and reliable autonomous vehicles. Winter says the technology industry is accelerating the pace of innovation in the automotive industry, and changing how we value cars. What youre seeing is a change in the industry with less focus on what vehicles look like and more focus on what can they do.  Kathy Winter, Intel vice president; general manager, Automated Driving Solutions Division With function trumping form, the industry is ripe for the many foundational computing and communications technologies Intel offers. Another Intel business unit with compelling technology for the future of transportation is Intels Programmable Solutions Group (PSG), formerly Altera. PSG General Manager Dan McNamara says that because field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be customized and reprogrammed on the fly, they are a great fit for many of the specialized computing tasks automated driving requires. In 2017, he expects to begin shipping a new automotive-grade Arria 10 FPGA that offers the highest performance processing by an FPGA at 20nm and will give automakers a head start on their ADAS systems. The autonomous driving revolution provides not only an increase in driver and pedestrian safety, but an interactive experience for the driver that will continue to evolve. We are focused on providing automakers with scalable technology to meet their customers needs.  Dan McNamara, Intel vice president; general manager, PSG In 2017, 5G prototypes start to take shape Unlocking the true potential of automated driving requires a reliable, robust and pervasive wireless network. These requirements are the basis of 5G networks, which are expected to become available starting in 2020, though trials are already underway. Rob Topol, General Manager of 5G business and technology within Intels Communications and Devices Group, expects these 5G trials will pick up steam in 2017. One big advancement will be the prototype devices used for testing. You will see us move from testing with larger trial platforms, to using more mobile and segment-specific form factors, Topol said. While 5G form factors will, ultimately, be limitless, thats a sure sign of progress. Unlike 4G wireless, which largely focused on making smartphones faster, industry leaders look to 5G to provide the higher data rates (1-20 Gbps), lower latency and capacity needed for the blossoming Internet of Things (IoT), new service models and immersive new experiences. Its an ambitious undertaking thats well underway. Without 5G, the Internet of Things will not reach its potential.  Rob Topol, general manager of 5G business and technology, Communications and Devices Group Well be talking more about these future trends when the industry convenes at CES next week. You can stay up-to-date with related Intel news and activities in our CES 2017 newsroom, including a livestream of our CEOs press conference. On Jan. 4 at 4 p.m., Brian Krzanich will immerse you in virtual reality to experience how Intel technology is extending far beyond consumer electronics to define almost every aspect of our lives and transform industries. We hope to see you there. Happy New Year!

The memory chip producer seems to be heading for another market-beating year. Exactly how far can Micron run in 2017? Let's find out. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 31, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained a market-stomping 57% in 2016. Can the memory chip specialist build on this success with another fantastic performance in 2017? First, I have already taken a look at the potential downside for us Micron investors. In short, the risks involved in owning Micron next year are significant but also limited. We won't see any record-breaking drops next year, even in the worst-case scenario of another full-blown price war in the memory industry. On the upside, both DRAM and NAND memory prices have stabilized dramatically in recent months. Both Micron's management and independent market analysts agree that chip prices should remain firm over the next several months. Since Micron (and all other chip manufacturers) always works on pushing down the cost of making each chip, stable prices lead to wider margins over time. That's what the memory business looks like right now, in a rare and welcome break from the sector's history of raging price wars. As long as these conditions hold true, Micron's profits and cash flows will continue to rise. In a perfect world, that inevitably leads to higher share prices. The valuation angle So how much room is there for more gains on top of that tremendous 2016 showing? Quite a bit, actually. From a historical point of view, Micron traded at more than $36 per share just two years ago. Climbing back to that level would work out to at least a 60% gain, starting at today's prices. If you think that can't be done, you could look back at the much faster rise in 2013 and 2014 for some velocity guidance. The price swings in this crazy industry may not be very predictable, but they sure know how to bring the heat in both directions. So Micron could very well jump back to $36 in a single year, if recent history is any indication. How about traditional valuation metrics? Let me compare Micron to some other veterans in the chip industry: Ratio Micron Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Forward P/E 9.1 13.8 14.1 Price to Sales (ttm) 1.8 3.1 4.2 Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (ttm) 9.8 17.4 13.2 Data source: YCharts. I'm not necessarily saying that Micron deserves to trade at the same multiples as Intel or Qualcomm, of course. Both of these sector peers are much larger than Micron in terms of annual sales, various types of profit, and market caps. Intel dominates the market for central processors, and Qualcomm holds a similar position in the field of wireless communications, while Micron is only the third-largest player in a highly volatile sector. So yeah, Micron probably deserves a risk-related discount. But the company is on an upward trend right now, and that crazy memory market has settled down significantly in recent years. Several brutal rounds of cyclical shakeouts have led to the largest memory providers swallowing up all the minnows, and Micron is one of the rival-eating survivors. Frankly, I'd be shocked to see another price war in the next couple of years. Based on the table above, you could give Micron a 60% price boost right now and the stock would still look reasonably cheap in the context of large sector peers. Watch Micron get to work on earning back that rebate, and stock prices could surge in a hurry. The key issue here is memory chip pricing, based on the balance between supply and demand in that market. Supply is tighter than demand right now and should remain so for at least a good chunk of 2017 as well. What's next? So yeah, I think that this stock will climb even higher next year. Will it be the best year ever? Probably not -- Micron set a high bar by tripling in 2013 -- but still a very healthy performance indeed. I'll certainly keep a close eye on Micron next year. A 60% gain would place the stock close to what I'd consider fair value in a best-case memory market scenario. At that point, it just might be time to sign off and move my Micron capital to another stock with a longer runway for growth ahead of it. But right now, I'm a happy shareholder.

They show little interest in the old philanthropic model - attending galas and endowing their alma mater. Today, relatively young technology billionaires are creating a new paradigm of philanthropy, one that arguably sets a new standard of ethical practice in the non-profit sector. Their purpose is to use their influence to push the boundaries of science and technology for the creation of social benefit. In a growing trend, in 2014, more than US$5 billion was donated by wealthy technologists for this purpose. A cynic might say it is about lining their own pockets, yet there is ample evidence to suggest they are motivated by a kind of win-win altruism. These are men and women who think global and want to leave a legacy. Who are we talking about? It is a long list indeed, with names like Gordon Moore (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan, Sean Parker (Facebook), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Michael Dell, to mention a few. Shortfalls in government funding One factor in the rise of the new philanthropy is that government spending on science in the US has been dropping in recent times. Research institutes are closing, projects being put on hold or abandoned for want of funding. Increasingly, science philanthropy is stepping up to address the shortfall. It is not surprising that wealthy technologists would want to invest in pushing the boundaries of science. Technology is, after all, applied science. Without the research, technological progress slows to a crawl. As a result, we are seeing the priorities of science being influenced less by government policy and academia, and more by the priorities of the philanthropic giver. After all, who pays the piper calls the tune. It is a trend giving rise to some disquiet in the science establishment. With pressure on government budgets from other priorities, the trend towards the outsourcing of science funding is likely to continue. The Gates Foundation Even the wealthiest of governments would be hard pressed to match the funding of some of the larger new “venture philanthropists”. With assets of around US$44 billion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a prime example of the new philanthropy. To date it has spent roughly US$10 billion on a range of programs in developing countries to improve health care, provide education and reduce poverty. It has funded efforts to control infectious diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It also funds family planning, basic health care, nutrition and sanitation. It would be difficult to criticise such efforts, though it will not stop some from claiming they are only giving back what they had no right to take in the first place. Being a philanthropist today can be a thankless business. Is there a dark side? Silicon Valley billionaire and philanthropist Peter Thiel incurred the wrath of his peers by strongly supporting Donald Trump, donating money and making speeches for his election. Thiel has since been named a member of the President-elect’s transition team, indicating that he is not just a supporter but a trusted friend. What does Thiel expect in return? Time will tell, but it is likely he will be most valuable serving as a mediator between a Trump White House and the largely left-wing Silicon Valley establishment to implement a new policy agenda. Not an easy job. The new philanthropy is diversifying It is a measure of the hyper-partisan nature of politics today that would call participation in the political process a bad thing. It’s actually a good thing. We need more intelligent, capable people with technology skills to enter a field that has been brought into disrepute in recent times.

View Latest Posts >>> ‘Russian hackers’ penetrate US power grid with ‘outdated Ukrainian malware’ By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on December 31, 2016 … from Russia Today,  Moscow Government, Security and the Media [ Editor’s Note:  This Russian hacking story is turning into a Three Stoogies movie rerun. Experienced Intel people, even those who are not intimate code people know that setting up blinds, dead ends and pasties as diversions for hacks is a operational staple. When VT was running down our own hack attack, tracing the packets back, the trail was running through major university and some defense contractor servers where endless fingers could be in the pie. But with more digging the trail ended at a US military base where “training” was done for doing this very thing. Something thought it would be fun to screw VT over, but they underestimated that our friends tracked it right to the a very building on the base. It was handled quietly but semi-publicly at a wedding on the base where the commander was confronted for doing something so stupid, and illegal which would make our military look bad if it were made public. He stormed out of the wedding and we were never hacked from that location again. The real hoax part of the story, which indicts all of Congress and corporate media, is that the US, Israelis and the Brits are major major hackers, and have been for a long time. Those who are being painted as threats, were of course major targets themselves, so would have a perfect right of retaliation, a kind of cyber war mutual destruction dance. But here, where we live in a supposedly free country, with a free press and representative government, this very important framing is given to the public as it would make them less manipulable. And lastly, as with Wikileaks and its massive data dumps, Israel continuous to miraculously escape any and all embarrassing disclosures. We are led to believe with the zero number of reported Israeli hacking cases against the US that they are not doing it, which is kind of funny. Our own people are “Truth Hacking” the American public. I don’t remember that specifically being in the oaths of office that our people take, “and I refuse to hide from the public the massive hacking that the US government engages in for whatever reasons it deems necessary”. When a government is an aggressive hacker, it knows it will be retaliated against, and thus must paint the retaliator as the aggressor to its public. We have no duty to swallow the lie, but the problem is how so many also don’t feel any duty to do anything about it, so we have only ourselves to blame for that… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ – First published … December 31,  2016 – A Vermont utility sounded the alarm after finding malware code on a laptop that the FBI and DHS had touted as associated with Russian hackers. However, cybersecurity specialists say the code came from an outdated Ukrainian hacking tool. – On Thursday, the FBI and DHS released a joint report on a hacking operation they called ‘Grizzly Steppe’. They claimed the operation was linked to the Russian government, alleging that it had targeted “US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” Along with the report, the US security agencies released a sample of the malware code allegedly used in the Grizzly Steppe operation to compromise US computer networks. The code was also shared with executives from 16 industries around the nation, including the financial, utility, and transportation sectors, according to a Washington Post report. On Friday, Burlington Electric, a Vermont-based power company, released a statement saying that the malware code had been detected during a scan of a single company laptop that was not connected to the grid. “We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. Our team is working with federal officials to trace this malware and prevent any other attempts to infiltrate utility systems. We have briefed state officials and will support the investigation fully,” the statement said. The US media reported the incident as if Russian hackers had penetrated America’s electric grids, prompting some officials to call on the federal government to protect Americans from Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality-of-life, economy, health, and safety,” Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin said in a statement. “This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling,” he said. Meanwhile, a number of IT specialists that have analyzed the code and other evidence published by the US government are questioning whether it really proves a Russian connection, let alone a connection to the Russian government. Wordfence, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in protecting websites running WordPress, a PHP-based platform, published a report on the issue on Friday. Wordfence said they had traced the malware code to a tool available online, which is apparently funded by donations, called P.A.S. that claims to be “made in Ukraine.” The version tested by the FBI/DHS report is 3.1.7, while the most current version available on the tool’s website is 4.1.1b. “One might reasonably expect Russian intelligence operatives to develop their own tools or at least use current malicious tools from outside sources,” the report says. The second part of the analysis deals with the list of IP addresses provided by the US agencies. The report says they “don’t appear to provide any association with Russia” and “are probably used by a wide range of other malicious actors.” This week, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of hacking US computer networks in order to influence the presidential to justify imposing some of the toughest sanctions on Russia yet, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and blocking access to two leisure compounds used by Russian Foreign Ministry personnel and their visitors. Russia chose to ignore the punitive measures, calling their imposition a clear provocation, while saying that Moscow will build its relations with the US based on the policies of the next administration under President-elect Donald Trump, not President Barack Obama’s parting shots. In October, Putin ridiculed the idea that Russia could influence the US presidential election, saying that America was not “a banana republic.” ____________ Related Posts: FBI backs CIA claim that Russian hackers meddled in US election Russian FSB foils terrorist attacks plotted by Ukrainian intel agents in Crimea Ukrainian admiral appointed to command Russian Baltic Sea Fleet Breaking: US Sabotages Syrian Power Grid PTSD and the Toxic World Around Us The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Dean, Managing Editor  December 31, 2016 at 5:49 pm Thanks Rich, just wonderful timing for that clip. I did a piece on that old movie earlier in the year as it was so fitting. Edward Longshanks  January 1, 2017 at 2:52 am This clip is really a nice one. Despite usual US movie productions, this movie shows the reality, if we assume the “just married couple” are the Russians, evil Germans or demonic Japanese. The usual Rambo story with the picture of a single hero never fitted into any reality. Thanks for posting it, Mr. Buckley. Edward Longshanks  December 31, 2016 at 2:17 pm Hacking helps to steal patents as the US did it with windcraft plants in Germany. It is war, you what happens with horse thieves. But on the other hand it is a kind of voyeurism. If our life is hacked the whole day, hacking becomes the main content, a self purpose, means a constructed meaning of life. And if we use so much energy to steal instead of innovate something, we will come soon to an end.

Log in to Reply Khalid Talaat  December 31, 2016 at 11:22 am A banana republic is a country that produces only one crop. The US is far from being a banana republic. But US politicians are banana republic politicians, they only produce one crop, BS. In the 60s-80s we used to make fun of the Soviet politician’s propaganda BS. Now the Russians along with the rest of the world are laughing at the US politician’s BS, especially the “war on Terror.” The danger will surround us when US politicians totally believe their own BS. Folks, we are getting there. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 1, 2017 at 2:34 am Mr. Talaat, the Banana Republic is a historical term, mainly taken from Latin-America (the Germans say Mittel-Amerika). Of course those states as Costa-Rica or Panama lived from Banana-production, but their major aspect was the rule of US fruit corps as United Fruit etc., who pressed the last cent out of those countries. Those corps did not only control the agricultural market, they controlled the infrastructure, too, as the postal service, which was in a way necessary. Those corps promoted independence from former colonial powers to avoid the jurisdiction from former colonial powers and to implement a more comfortable one. This means the abolition of slavery was a false flag by the Union. In reality they prolongated it to the current days. During the last decades the US extended the global concentration camp watchtower policy on the entire planet with 750 overseas bases. So political oppositions call even Germany or Britain a Banana Republic which fits into the historical definition of the political structure. JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:53 am As per editor’s note, always look for something such as this to originate within our own borders. Someone is definitely trying to push America into a war with Russia and it smells of zionism. Jim, Your note about being hacked by the U.S. military would make a great article, maybe even a book or a Youtube video. Entitled, ” How the U.S Government and Military Wages War On the American People.” My attitude towards the U.S. military just took another negative leap. Log in to Reply JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:54 am P/S The picture at the top most accurately describes Washington. Nyuk, nyuk,nyuk. Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  December 31, 2016 at 5:55 pm Gordon published some of this, parts of it. a while back. We outlined it but did not name names. Our archives are filled with past battles. Of the 35,000+ archived articles Gordon must have done 3000. I am up to 1200. Just to go back and just skim over them is quite a trip down memory road. Trakkath  December 31, 2016 at 9:21 am This is the reason why I asked lately on which Russians he pointed at, Benjamin Mileikowsky and his gang or Waltzman and his gang or another kind of Russians.There are so many Russian outside Russia who can be meant. Log in to Reply Amelius  December 31, 2016 at 7:53 am I know it’s just a movie, but in Snowden, he says that the NSA installed bugs into the power grids of nations. He specifically mentions Japan and later in the movie, Syria’s grid goes out and people start going nuts. Why does the USG continue to embarrass itself, pointing the finger at Russia without providing any evidence? Log in to Reply JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:56 am It’s all a matter of who is running America. The owners. The same ones who control the CIA, NSA, FBI etc. The American people have no control. Donald Moore  December 31, 2016 at 7:24 am Trump need to hire some independent hackers to study those so called hacks. I believe if that is done it will show that all those so called hacks were done by the US Intelligence Services to keep the Cold War alive. The US Intelligence Services has some of the best in the world, ask Merkel. If the Russians swayed the election for Trump they did a lousy job of it since Killery won the popular vote. And do tell me how they arranged the swing states to give Trump with the victory with so close of the vote. It seems to me if you are going to do it you would give your side a bigger lead and not have it so close. I’m not saying Russia doesn’t hack, they do but the US hacks more than anybody in the world with UK and Israel at the top. It’s a known fact Israel spy’s on the US and hacking is one way of spying, they don’t trust Obama, rightfully so. So every country spy’s, hacks more some then others so calling the kettle black when you are doing it won’t get my sympathy. Log in to Reply Trakkath  December 31, 2016 at 10:57 am Independend hackers ? And then what, sue those responsible at an independend court and by and independend judge and jury ? If you find them send me a note. Go dream on. Donald Moore  December 31, 2016 at 3:49 pm No there is no way in the US to sue the Government, what I mean to put the nail in the coffin of Obama and the Secret Services that they were behind the so call Russian hackers. And again what I mean of independent hackers is hire real hackers to do the work that is not affiliated with the government. It is more to show McCain and Lindsey and their Neocons that Trump is three steps ahead of them and their Bushido.

Stock Market Today Stocks End Down, But Up For 2016; Apple, Microsoft Drag On Dow, Nasdaq The stock market fell Friday but ended the year with decent gains. Will the Dow hit 20,000 in the new year? (Richard B. Levine/Newscom) NANCY GONDO 12/30/2016 Reprints The stock market wrapped up 2016 with a whimper Friday, as the key indexes posted moderate losses. But for the year, they ended with decent gains after a post-election rally. The Nasdaq fell 0.9%, the S&P 500 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. Volume was slightly higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to preliminary data, likely due to "window dressing" by fund managers as they adjust their portfolios. The Dow, up 13% for the year, closed well below 19,800 after recently flirting with the 20,000 level. The S&P 500 notched a 9.5% gain, while the Nasdaq advanced 7.5%. Gold miners, telecom and chip stocks led the downside in the stock market today. Banks, property REITs and insurance stocks were among the few industry groups that posted small gains. Tech stocks, among the biggest losers on the Dow, took a hit. Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) all shed about 1% each. Three of the four big-cap techs outperformed the Nasdaq for the year, but fell short of the Dow. Microsoft rose 12%, Cisco 11%, Apple 10% and Intel 5%. Microsoft remains just out of the 5% buy zone from a 58.80 flat-base buy point. Cisco is trying to hold support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base; Intel has shaped a cup with handle with a 37.44 buy entry. Apple may form a handle as it continues to build the right side of a cup base. The buy point for now stands at 118.79. Though shares are still 14% below their May 2015 peak, they made an impressive run in the back half of 2016, rising 33% from a May 2016 low to an early October high. Apple dipped 0.8% in below-average volume Friday amid a Nikkei Asia Review report it's cutting back on iPhone production due to weak demand. In other news, Apple reportedly plans to start making iPhones for the Indian market at a Bangalore factory in April. In the IBD 50, graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest loss, down more than 4% in heavy trade. Friday's action serves up the second big-volume drop in three sessions, a bearish sign. The stock plunged 7% Wednesday after reversing from a new intraday high. While it's due for a slowdown after a torrid 227% YTD gain, the heavy-volume reversals are alarming. SVB Financial (SIVB) was the biggest IBD 50 gainer for the day, picking up nearly 0.8% in tepid trade. The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank is far extended from a 112.93 buy point first cleared in October. Other financials with small gains included Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Goldman Sachs (GS) and East West Bancorp (EWBC).

That could trigger an even larger selloff, and there could be a sizable correction to start the year. Where does that leave Nvidia , Tesla and Netflix , three stocks that moved sharply earlier this week and have been in the news for a variety of reasons. Each company offers compelling reasons for investor to buy shares, but each also raises questions. Video provided by TheStreet Media: Brandpoint When Paulina Sliwinska, a fund manager at Baillie Gifford & Co., made the trip to Silicon Valley looking for the next big thing in technology, she found it — not in a hot startup run by a 23-year-old whiz kid just out of Stanford, but in a 23-year-old semiconductor maker that’s had the same chief executive officer since its founding. Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of graphics-chip maker Nvidia, has won over Sliwinska and many other investors this year with claims that his products, once confined to the niche of computer-gaming machines, are breaking out to become key components of nascent technologies from voice recognition to self-driving cars. “He’s so engaging,” said Sliwinska. “Even from this point the opportunities in front of it over the next 10 years are astonishing.” After she met Huang in August, the fund added to its position and is now the 10th-largest holder. The company was the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year, outpacing the No. 2 stock by a multiple of almost three. Under Huang, Nvidia has built itself into the leading supplier of graphics processors, the chips that deliver the ever-more-realistic images that make computer games so immersive and addictive. For most of its history, that’s been a relatively small market, with the much bigger businesses of computer processors and smartphone chips dominated by Intel and Qualcomm. Photo: Jae C.

Hong, AP Nvidia stock soars on power of graphics chips 1 / 1 Back to Gallery This year, though, Huang’s longtime belief that the fundamental advantages of his graphics chips would give them a broader role in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has begun to pay off — and is buoying Nvidia’s earnings. In the third quarter, demand for chips used in data centers and cars helped fuel a 54 percent rise in sales, and profit doubled to a record. That performance was the result of years of investment in the hardware and software that enables computers and cars to think for themselves, according to Huang. The stock rose 30 percent on Nov. 11, the day after the earnings report. Yet there was no victory lap from the CEO — his company is going to battle in markets served by Intel, whose annual research and development spending is twice Nvidia’s revenue, and Qualcomm, which has the largest cash balance in the chip industry. “The only thing we can guarantee is the velocity with which we innovate,” Huang said at the time. Nvidia declined to make Huang available for comment for this story. Huang runs Nvidia like it’s still a startup, making snap decisions and demanding fast execution, according to those who have worked for him. For a semiconductor maker, that’s no small feat: Designing a chip, getting it ready for market and then having it manufactured can take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Chip companies publish road maps that reflect those intricate details, and they build their organizations around it. Decisions on what to make in multibillion-dollar plants requires extensive planning. At Nvidia, things can happen a lot faster. In the space of a short meeting hosted by Huang, an executive trying to give an update on progress of a new chip design might find himself silenced as Huang calls an engineer to check on a technical question — then instantly decide that the project is dead or make the call to head in a different direction. Huang has long clung to the belief that graphics chips would play a key role in technological innovation. But past efforts to spread their use, such as in phones, have failed to catch on or taken a lot longer to deliver tangible results. While the annual advent of a new high-end GeForce chip from Nvidia has long been viewed as a gift from above for computer gamers — many of whom think nothing of paying more for one component than most ordinary users would for a whole computer — Nvidia as a company had been less revered until this year. Its stock has struggled to rise higher than $35 in the 17 years since it first went public. Friday, the shares closed at $106.74. Some investors and analysts who follow Nvidia the most closely missed cashing in on the stock. The reason: They’ve heard Huang’s pitches before and initially wrote off his predictions about artificial intelligence and self-driving cars as no different from previous forays that fizzled. “Jen-Hsun didn’t dial it up or dial it down — he was just as enthusiastic about the automotive opportunity as he was for Tegra,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners, referring to the company’s mobile phone chip announced in 2008. The Tegra line of chips was Nvidia’s attempt to get into smartphones, which Huang correctly pointed out were on the cusp of transforming computing and communication. Yet because he and others underestimated the importance of an integrated cellular connection, Nvidia’s offering failed to win significant business. Unlike other companies that lost out to Qualcomm, Huang didn’t close down the project — instead Nvidia fielded its own game console, called Shield, as a way to try to create a market for Tegra and showcase its abilities to potential customers. While Shield never challenged the dominance of Xbox or PlayStation, the product led to orders for Tegra from Nintendo, which made the chip the heart of one its new game systems. “It was more or less a science project internal to Nvidia, and now Nintendo has adopted it,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “That’s another example of them pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, creating a market and then giving it to their customer.” Ian King is a Bloomberg writer.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Zotac will show off a Kaby Lake Zbox and more at CES 2017 by Eric Frederiksen  2:22 PM on December 30, 2016 With CES not even a week away, hardware companies are announcing their lineups for the show. Zotac has plans to show off a new model of Zbox mini-PC, a Thunderbolt 3 graphics dock, a GTX 1080 Mini graphics card, and more. The newest iteration of Zotac's Zbox CI549 Mini PC will pack one of Intel's new Kaby Lake processors, cooled with a passive heatsink to keep noise down.  This new Zbox will also feature Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, complete with all the protocols that offers, including full USB 3.1 10Gbps transfer rates, the USB Power Delivery fast-charging spec, and DisplayPort 1.2. Also new are the additions of Intel's UNITE and vPro, which will add secure conferencing and remote management capabilities. Zotac's External Graphics Dock continues the Thunderbolt 3 theme. The dock features a PCIe x16 slot inside, three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 3.0 Quick Charge port, as well as one Thunderbolt 3 Type-C connector. The External Graphics Dock will allow the user to add desktop-level graphics capabilities to just about any Thunderbolt 3 device, in addition to powering the device and adding more ports—all potential boons for gamers who want to add more graphics power at their desks. Finally, Zotac also plans to show off the GeForce GTX 1080 Mini. The 1080 Mini packs the same 2560 CUDA cores as its bigger cousins and a base clock speed of 1620 MHz. It retains the the same 8GB of GDDR5X memory as bigger cards, as well. Its primary claim to fame is its tiny size. Zotac says the Mini is the smallest GeForce GTX 1080 card on the market. CES runs January 4 through 7, so prices and availability info for all of these new products should be revealed soon.   Tags: Graphics Systems Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

The pace of change in the storage industry is accelerating - and that's good for us. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | December 30, 2016 -- 13:30 GMT (05:30 PST) | Topic: Storage 2017 - the sky's the limit!Robin Harris The pace of storage change continues to accelerate, and its impact on us continues to grow. Digital storage is central to a digital civilization, and as we grow more digital, we grow more dependent on improvements in storage. Here's what to expect in 2017. AI AI will make stored data - and therefore storage- more valuable. When you can take - as we can today - a grainy surveillance video or a blurred face and read a license plate number of determine someone's identity using AI, the value of stored data rises, for good or ill. The year ahead Meet 2017's hot new smartphone brands The future of robotics What's top of mind for the CIO So much change in store for storage Smartphones: What's in the pipeline? Make your digital strategy a success in 2017 Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks Can more meta thinking free us from current malaise? Why businesses can't ignore the cloud market IT spending to rebound in 2017, led by software, services As the AI revolution gathers force, expect that researchers will discover even more ways to use machine intelligence to generate value from stored data. In our democracy, I hope, citizens will have some say in the ways AI is used by intelligence agencies and corporations. NVRAM We'll see the first NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) in notebooks. This is the year that we'll see the first mainstream NVRAM products from Intel and, I hope, others. Intel's NVRAM SSDs won't be a thousand times faster, but they will be faster, more durable, and, yes, more expensive than NAND flash based SSDs. But more importantly, we'll see the first notebooks with NVRAM used in conjunction with standard RAM to expand main memory, or, as the industry puts it, as storage class memory (SCM). This is an old idea - remember IBM's System 38? - given new relevance by NVRAM's speed, cost, and density. It's the higher density that will pave the way for servers and notebooks with hundreds of gigabytes and even terabytes of main memory. Active archives. Active archives will continue to gain performance and popularity in enterprise IT, as CIOs find they're much cheaper and faster than cloud services. IaaS vendor ClearSky Data has already demonstrated that with smart caching, object storage can be as fast as NAS boxes. The greater data integrity, lower OpEx, and simpler operation of object storage systems then seal the deal. NAS won't go away, as the setup costs for object storage remain higher, but the withering of RAID-based NAS will begin in 2017. Cloud Cloud services will get much more competitive as Microsoft, Google, and IBM continue to work their unique advantages to chip away at Amazon's early lead. Amazon's early dominance of IaaS suggested a continuing lead over all comers, but unlike IBM in the 1960s, Amazon Web Services faces a trio of large, profitable, and uniquely advantaged competitors. Google's brainpower, Microsoft's desktop and research footprint, and IBM's enterprise stronghold are advantages that AWS's early lead won't be able to overcome. That's good news for the rest of us, as cloud services continue to grow and improve. Weep not for AWS, as the market is growing fast enough for all of them to prosper - for now. Super fast PCIe/NVMe PCIe/NVMe SSDs will be almost universal on pro notebooks be year end. Apple's new PCIe/NVMe MacBook Pros may have their troubles, but storage performance isn't one of them, and the rest of the industry is jumping on the bandwagon. With read and write performance well over 2 gigabytes per second, PCIe/NVMe storage leaves SATA SSDs in the dust. That, in turn, boosts the notebook's virtual memory system, giving you a much snappier tool. The Storage Bits take Sadly, 2017 won't be wonderful for everyone in the industry. I'm expecting more layoffs from storage companies that have slow to adapt to the accelerating changes in technology and competition. But for those of us who rely upon and/or manage storage, big improvements keep coming. Now, if the rest of the world could improve as well. . . . Courteous comments welcome, of course.

The iPhone 7 was released without a headphone jack, an unpopular choice that's now been somewhat ameliorated by the launch of the AirPods, and the MacBook Pro has been plagued by battery issues, graphics problems, and complaints about the high price of the device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also saw its first decline in iPhone sales in 2016, but 2017 could potentially turn things around for the company. We're expecting the biggest iPhone revision we've seen since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched in 2014, plus we're also expecting major iPad changes, refreshed desktop Macs, and software improvements. iPhone 8 - September 2017 Rumors about the 2017 iPhone started ramping up before the iPhone 7 was even released, so there's a lot of information out there, and at this point, quite a bit of it conflicts, so it's difficult to get a clear picture of what Apple is planning for the iPhone's 10th anniversary. If you read all of the rumors and suss out some common themes, there are a few concrete details that hint at what likely to see in the next-generation iPhone. We're assuming it's going to be called the "iPhone 8" due to design changes that are more radical than we'd expect for an "iPhone 7s," but it's entirely possible Apple will go with another name. It looks like there's going to be at least three iPhone models, and one of those will have an OLED display. It's sounding like we're going to get one premium OLED iPhone somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 inches, with either a flexible curved display that wraps around the edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or an edge-to-edge display more in line with the current design of the iPhone 7. These seem to be mutually exclusive concepts, but we've heard rumors suggesting both possibilities. A display that wraps around the sides of the phone seems to suggest we'd continue to have some kind of top and bottom bezels, but information coming from sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seems to point more towards a less curved 2.5D edge-to-edge display that does away with bezels entirely. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Of course, it's possible some "edge-to-edge" rumors refer to the removal of the side bezels rather than the top and bottom bezels, but it's not entirely clear. Either way, it seems the iPhone 8 will do away with the Home button, incorporating a Touch ID fingerprint scanner directly into the display. Ambient light sensors, microphone, and camera may also be located under the display for a true single piece of glass look. Along with that OLED model, rumors also suggest we're going to get two other iPhone models, perhaps in standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch configurations. These would presumably be less expensive and would use easier to obtain standard LCD display panels. Either the OLED model or all three iPhone models rumored for 2017 will include a glass body, doing away with the aluminum-style body that Apple has used for several years in a row. The glass back and the display may be housed in an aluminum frame for stability, but the glass itself will mean a significantly different visual aesthetic. A glass body will bring a fresh look, but there's another reason behind the materials switch -- wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be developing long-range wireless charging techniques, which could make their debut in 2017. An aluminum body can interfere with wireless charging speeds, while a glass body offers less interference. It's not entirely clear if Apple is developing its own wireless charging solution or working with a company like Energous, nor do we know exactly how wireless charging will be implemented, but it is looking like a feature we can expect to see in all 2017 iPhone models. Other features rumored for the 2017 iPhone include a faster A11 processor, more advanced biometric features like improved facial recognition techniques or perhaps even iris scanning, and an upgraded Taptic Engine able to create "more complex tactile vibrations." Dual cameras are expected to be offered in some iPhone models, but optical image stabilization could be added to both lenses (instead of just the wide-angle lens) in the next-generation iPhone. Apple is rumored to be considering upwards of 10 different prototypes for the 2017 iPhone, which explains why we may be hearing so many different rumors about the device at this point in time. As we get closer to the September launch date of the 2017 iPhone and as Apple's own plans solidify, we'll get a better idea of what to expect. Read full iPhone 8 roundup iPad Pro - Spring 2017? Apple is working on a revamped version of the iPad Pro, and as with the iPhone, the rumors are all over the place. Apple is said to be planning on introducing three models in 2017: a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new mid-range model with a display that's somewhere between 10.1 and 10.9 inches. The 10-inch iPad Pro is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge nearly bezel-free display much like the iPhone 8, and its actual body size will be identical to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. For that reason, rumors suggest the 10-inch iPad Pro will be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but Apple plans to keep the 9.7-inch iPad Pro around as a low-cost tablet option. The 10-inch and 12.9-inch models will reportedly be the new flagship models, upgraded with faster A10X processors. The exact size of the 10-inch iPad hasn't been sussed out yet. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often reliably predicts Apple's plans, says it will measure in at 10.5-inches. Japanese site Mac Otakara has a more mixed track record and has released two reports pointing towards both 10.9 and 10.1 inches. Rumors out of the Taiwanese supply chain have suggested 10.5 inches, and research conducted by Barclays Research says it'll be 10.9 inches. One rumor from Mac Otakara also suggests Apple will introduce a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Pro to succeed the iPad mini, but that information has not yet been confirmed by another source. With Apple planning to introduce new iPads in 2017, there may also be more of a focus on iPad-specific software during the year. Apple is said to be aiming to enhance the iPad Pro with new hardware and software features that cater specifically to professional users, such as a faster display for smoother on-screen zooming, panning, and scrolling, and expanded iOS support for the Apple Pencil that will allow it to work in more areas. Mac Otakara and Barclays Research have both predicted an early 2017 launch for the new iPads, perhaps in March or April, but if a radical edge-to-edge redesign is in the works, it is questionable as to whether Apple will upstage the 2017 iPhone 8 that's expected in September with an edge-to-edge iPad launching earlier in the year. Read full iPad Pro roundup iMac - Spring 2017 New iMacs didn't debut alongside the MacBook Pro at Apple's October 2016 event, but there's rumored to be an update in the works. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, we will see iMacs in "mid-1H17," which translates to sometime around March or April. A refreshed iMac will likely include Intel's Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics (in models that use discrete graphics options). The iMac is potentially due for a design refresh, but there have been no rumors suggesting anything more than a minor spec update is on the horizon. In fact, information from Bloomberg suggests all we'll see in a 2017 is a shift to USB-C and improved processors. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the iMac are set to come out in late December to early January, perfect timing for a spring release. We could potentially see a new keyboard that could ship alongside an iMac. Apple is rumored to be considering a standalone keyboard that incorporates a Touch Bar much like the keyboard of the MacBook Pro. Such a product might accompany a future iMac. Read full iMac roundup MacBook - Spring 2017 After introducing the 12-inch Retina MacBook in the spring of 2015, Apple launched a refreshed version in the spring of 2016, so it stands to reason we'll see yet another upgrade in the early months of 2017. Low-power Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the MacBook are already available, so that's a safe bet for what we might see in an upgraded machine. No design changes are expected. Read full MacBook roundup MacBook Pro - Fall 2017 New MacBook Pro models with a Touch Bar came out in 2016, and if Apple sticks to a traditional upgrade cycle, we'll see a refresh with upgraded internal components in the fall of 2017. Upgrades could include Kaby Lake processors and slight price cuts, but no external design changes are expected for the next several years. Read full MacBook Pro roundup Mac Pro The Mac Pro is overdue for an update, having last been updated in 2013, and we don't know when it's going to get a refresh. There are no concrete rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and no hints on what a new machine might include. Processors and graphics cards appropriate for an updated machine have long been available, but Apple could be waiting for the latest technology from companies like Intel and AMD before presenting a new Mac Pro. If a Mac Pro is planned for 2017, it could come in the spring alongside refreshed iMacs or, if Apple is waiting for cutting-edge current-generation chips, it could come in the fall. Read full Mac Pro roundup Mac mini Like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini has not seen an update for multiple years, with the last update coming in October 2014. Unfortunately, we've heard no rumors on whether or not we can expect to see an upgraded Mac mini in 2016, but if it does come, it could include Kaby Lake chips, faster SSD options, better graphics, and other improvements that have been brought to the Mac lineup over the last two years. Read full Mac mini roundup MacBook Air - Never With thinner, lighter MacBook and MacBook Pro machines now available, we don't expect to see another MacBook Air update. Apple will likely keep the MacBook Air around for a while as a low-cost option until it's able to cut the price on more expensive machines, but a new MacBook Air probably isn't going to happen. We could, however, potentially see small spec boosts and minor internal upgrades if Apple wants to keep its low-cost machine relevant for a longer period of time. Read full MacBook Air roundup Apple Watch - Fall 2017? If Apple is working on a third-generation Apple Watch for the fall of 2017, it's being kept tightly under wraps. We haven't heard any rumors suggesting a new Apple Watch is in the works for 2017, but if we are going to get one, it could come in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Potential features we could see in a new Apple Watch include the first significant design changes, upgraded processors, and perhaps sensors that Apple was not able to build into the first and second-generation versions. Cellular connectivity, a feature Apple has wanted to incorporate into the watch but hasn't been able to add due to battery life concerns, could also come in a 2017 model. We've also heard rumors of a potential switch to micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch, which can be thinner and lighter with improved color gamut and brightness. At this point, it's too early to tell if we're going to get a new Apple Watch in 2017, so we'll need to wait for additional rumors to surface over the first few months of the year to figure out what's going on with Apple's wearable. Read full Apple Watch roundup Apple TV - Unknown While it's possible Apple could introduce an Apple TV update in 2017, we don't think it's likely to happen. There are no recent rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and there's no real reason for the Apple TV to be updated. Prior to the introduction of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple went several years without introducing a new version of the device, so historically, it is not on an every-year or every-other-year update schedule like Macs and iOS devices. That said, rumors suggest a future Apple TV could include a better processor and perhaps some features that would allow it to compete with products like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, but there are other rumors that make it unclear whether these are features that would go into an Apple TV or another standalone product also rumored to be under development in Cupertino -- a home hub. Read full Apple TV roundup Home Hub - Late 2017? Rumors suggest Apple is working on a connected smart home device that's similar to the Amazon Echo. It would be equipped with a speaker and microphone and powered by Apple's Siri voice assistant. The hub, which has been in development for two years and is in the prototype testing phase, is said to be able to control HomeKit-connected accessories like lights, locks, window shades, and more through voice activation. It may feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology" than the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, products it will compete with. The Amazon Echo Information on the hub is a bit nebulous at this point, and it's not clear if it's going to be a new standalone speaker-only product or something in the AirPort or Apple TV families, both of which are possibilities. Facial recognition capabilities may be built into the device, and Apple is also working on Siri advancements that will allow it to do more. Because the hub is still in the prototyping phase, it's not entirely clear when it will launch. It could come in the later months of 2017, but it may not be ready until 2018. Apple could also scrap the project entirely. iOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Apple introduces a new version of its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads on a yearly basis, and in 2017, we're expecting to see iOS 11. There aren't many details on what will be included in iOS 11, but we've heard some hints suggesting there could be more of a focus on the iPad, with features like improved Apple Pencil support that cater to professional users. Apple is said to be planning on allowing the Apple Pencil to work more widely across the operating system. Apple is also rumored to be developing its own social networking app to compete with Snapchat and Facebook, allowing users to record video, edit video, and add filter and doodles. Such an app, if development continues, could debut alongside iOS 11. Apple has also been exploring augmented and virtual reality with a dedicated AR/VR team, and some kind of augmented reality feature could potentially be introduced in iOS 11. Maps and Photos are two areas where Apple could take advantage of augmented reality with the iPhone's camera, offering features like mapping overlays of real-world views or Snapchat-style photo filters. macOS 10.13 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The next-generation version of macOS (10.13) will come in the fall of 2017, introducing new features and refining the macOS operating system. There's no word yet on what features we might see in macOS 10.13, but details will likely leak out as it gets later in the year. Apple will preview macOS 10.13 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June. watchOS 4 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Alongside iOS 10.11, we're likely going to get watchOS 4, an updated version of the operating system that runs on the Apple Watch. There's no word yet on what new features could be included in watchOS 4, but we'll get our first glimpse of the new software in June. tvOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The final software update we're expecting in 2017 is tvOS 11, a new version of the tvOS software that runs on the fourth-generation TV. Apple is still working to refine the tvOS experience, so we can likely expect to see some interface improvements and other usability changes as the company gets a better handle on how people are using their set-top boxes. tvOS 11, along with macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and iOS 10.11, will be previewed at WWDC ahead of a fall launch.

I'll still rock their phones but when it comes to my next laptop, it's getting harder to root for Apple with competition heating up. With them dropping their Airport routers just gives me another reason to look elsewhere. I'm not into Apple jewelry or gimmicks to be honest. Rating: 37 Votes radiology 3 days ago at 11:58 am This is going to be the best year in the history of the company. The products Apple will realease are just unbelievable. They will blow people's mind. You will see the the widest range of colors in the entire tech industry. There will be new watch bands that will make YSL envy. Needless to say, all the products will be thinner and thinner as unnecessary ports are removed from the devices. The new emoji collection will have the most comprehensive ethnicity ever created. The number of online orders for each product category will be the largest in Apple's history and will outpace the competition by many folds. The company will continue to make efforts to improve safety and privacy. On top of that, they will continue to make sure we live in a better planet. For all that, I thank you Tim, for ruining Apple computers. Happy 2017, everyone! Rating: 31 Votes Cineplex 3 days ago at 11:56 am What to expect from Apple in 2017? One word. Disappointment!

I wouldn't hold my breath these days :( I'll be blue by next November Rating: 23 Votes Altivec88 3 days ago at 08:57 pm When I look at what Apple is doing in its entirety, I see a company who is slowly but surely gravitating towards what they believe will be the next big thing. The things we are criticizing Apple for, I feel they are simply growing pains as Apple prepares to leave older markets behind and enter new ones. And I feel we need to be understanding in this area. . As an enterprise customer that has built their entire business on Apple products the past 30+ years, We do not have the luxury of being understanding in this area. Unfortunately, for us pro's, "the next best thing" doesn't put food on our plate. For the time being we must rely on those old things called computers. The point of paying a premium for Apple products is the problem free (well less problem free lately) ecosystem between all products. From our iPhones and iPads, to our Mac mini servers and airport routers, right down to our work horse MacPro's. Allowing us to concentrate on our work rather than the technology more than makes up for the extra costs we pay Apple. The problem is we've been waiting 6 years to update our aging and dying 12 core 2010 MacPro's. We purchased one 2013 MacPro to try out and there was virtually no improvement in rendering speeds, yet they were double the price of our 2010 models. So month by month we kept waiting for a speed bump. Both Dell and HP have updated their workstations twice since 2013 and currently offer 44 core systems. When Apple announced their Mac Event at the end of 2016, we were sure a Mac Pro update was imminent. Nope, not even a mention... That silence was deafening to us and triggered a stop order on all future purchases of any Apple product. We use iPhones and iPads to automatically sync notes and photos to our pro machines. If we have to switch our Mac Pro's to Dell or HP workstations, we have no reason to buy Macbook Pros, iMacs, iPads or iPhones. We will be switching those to surface's and window phones for easier integration and lower cost. I know, windows sucks and we don't want to leave, but as other pointed out, Apple is pushing us out the door by neglecting us. So I get that consumers who are okay with outdated tech and slow updates get upset at seeing all the negativity. Trust me, I use to be a die hard fan boy too. But when your PC using competition is blowing you out of the water because their tech is far far superior to yours and it starts costing you big dollars, you would show a little displeasure too. 2017 is the year that things better start popping out this long dragged out pipeline or I really won't care any more. More specifically, no Mac Pro by March and you can put a fork in it. Thanks Tim for ruining Apple. Rating: 21 Votes tech4all 3 days ago at 02:26 pm Hope we get less whiners/trolls/trolling posts next year! If Apple delivers satisfactory products, then people will stop stating their dissatisfaction, or "whining" and "trolling" as some call it. Rating: 21 Votes gertruded 3 days ago at 12:24 pm We are Apple users since our first Apple 2 plus through iPhone 6splus, we are finally through. Our 2007 iMac, our 2009 mini, and our 2012 air are all aging and need replacement soon. We purchased a Windows machine for Christmas and it seems to be OK. Apple is clearly abandoning their Mac line. The difficult conversion of files has begun. Apple left us, not the other way around. Rating: 20 Votes BreadofWonder 3 days ago at 11:13 am No reason to update the Apple TV? Really? I can think of two really good ones: 4K and HDR. Every other streamer has it at this point and I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't do it too before the end of the year.

Let's take a close look.

We haven't been happy with SMI-controlled SSDs since back in the SM2246 days when everything was still MLC-based. We've tested a ton of SMI SM2256-powered SDDs, and none have earned a TweakTown recommendation, simply because none could sustain write transfers of more than about 125 MB/s, which is slower than a typical mechanical HDD.   We recently reviewed the SMI SM2260-powered Intel 600p NVMe SSD, and it had the same issue even though it is a Gen3 x4 PCIe NVMe SSD with 3D flash. We will go ahead and tell you up front that the SM2258-powered SU800 does not have this issue. Even the 128GB model delivers over 350 MB/s with our write transfer test.     ADATA's SU800 has a Micron 3D TLC flash array under the hood. This is the same 384Gbit 3D TLC flash that powers Crucial's MX300 and Intel's 600p. The SU800 will be competing directly with Crucial's popular MX300 for market share. They both have the same flash array but employ different controllers. Crucial's MX300 is powered by Marvell's 88SS1074 4-channel flash controller, the SU800, as mentioned, is powered by SMI's SM2258 4-channel controller. The SM2258 is armed with an advanced LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) ECC engine. LDPC error correction significantly extends the endurance of SU800's flash array netting the SU800 more than double the endurance of the MX300 at similar capacity points.   As with all modern TLC SSDs, the SU800 employs pSLC caching to boost burst performance. SMI calls the SLC caching scheme used by the SM2258 "Intelligent SLC Caching." We don't know a whole lot about the technical details of SMI's Intelligent SLC Caching technology, other than it seems to be dynamic in nature and that it functions far better than what we've seen previously from SMI-controlled SSDs. Unlike what we see from the MX300 series, the extra capacity that is inherent to Micron 384Gbit flash isn't rolled into extra user capacity or OP, but rather into the SU800's SLC cache capacity, which should be very good from a performance standpoint. Let's take a close look at that performance.     Specifications     ADATA Ultimate SU800 SATA III SSD:   Sequential Read: up to 560 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 520 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: up to 80,000 IOPS Max 4K Random Write Speed: up to 80,000 IOPS Endurance: up to 800TBW MTTF: 2 Million Hours Warranty: 3-Year Limited Warranty DEVSLP ECC: LDPC SMART TRIM Garbage Collection Software: SSD Toolbox, Migration Software   Current Pricing: 128GB = $49.99, 256GB = $69.99, 512GB = $129.99, 1TB = Unknown Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find the ADATA Ultimate SU800 512GB SATA III SSD for sale below.

Beignet Now Implements Enough OpenCL 2.0 To Support It For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 30 December 2016 at 08:00 AM EST. 1 Comment Intel's open-source Beignet OpenCL project for implementing CL/GPGPU support for Intel graphics hardware is on the edge of a big milestone. We've been seeing more OpenCL 2.0 code land in Beignet while over night there was yet more code to land: for OpenCL 2.0 there was device enqueue work, cl_kernel pointer to GPGPU, and other work. One of the final commits though is what excited us this morning: add an option to enable OpenCL 2.0. With the latest Git code, Intel users can now officially expose OpenCL 2.0 support rather than just OpenCL 1.2. The OpenCL 2.0 support isn't enabled by default currently but -DENABLE_OPENCL_20 must be set for the CMake build system. Additionally, the OpenCL 2.0 support is just for Intel Skylake "Gen 9" graphics and newer. As well, Beignet must be built against LLVM 3.9+ and libdrm 2.4.66+ for meeting the requirements for being able to expose OpenCL 2.0 for Intel GPUs on Linux. Great milestone to end the year for this open-source OpenCL project, I'll be trying to run some fresh Beignet OpenCL benchmarks shortly. Meanwhile the Clover Gallium3D-based OpenCL implementation is basically abandoned at OpenCL 1.1, AMD is still working on open-sourcing their newer ROCm code, the AMD binary driver currently advertises OpenCL 1.2 as does the NVIDIA proprietary Linux driver. Hopefully there will be a more fruitful open-source OpenCL ecosystem in 2017. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

The site continues: "The chassis can accommodate any double wide graphics card with a maximum size of 280 mm in length and 41 mm in depth, but nothing too custom with regards heat pipes and backplates because the space is constrained".     GIGABYTE powers the GTX 1080-based Gaming GT system with a 400W PSU, and of course - RGB LEDs on top of it. They can be controlled with GIGABYTE's Ambient LED software.   As for pricing and availability, we know nothing on that yet - but we're sure GIGABYTE will have some big announcements next week at CES.

The memory chip producer seems to be heading for another market-beating year. Exactly how far can Micron run in 2017? Let's find out. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 31, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained a market-stomping 57% in 2016. Can the memory chip specialist build on this success with another fantastic performance in 2017? First, I have already taken a look at the potential downside for us Micron investors. In short, the risks involved in owning Micron next year are significant but also limited. We won't see any record-breaking drops next year, even in the worst-case scenario of another full-blown price war in the memory industry. On the upside, both DRAM and NAND memory prices have stabilized dramatically in recent months. Both Micron's management and independent market analysts agree that chip prices should remain firm over the next several months. Since Micron (and all other chip manufacturers) always works on pushing down the cost of making each chip, stable prices lead to wider margins over time. That's what the memory business looks like right now, in a rare and welcome break from the sector's history of raging price wars. As long as these conditions hold true, Micron's profits and cash flows will continue to rise. In a perfect world, that inevitably leads to higher share prices. The valuation angle So how much room is there for more gains on top of that tremendous 2016 showing? Quite a bit, actually. From a historical point of view, Micron traded at more than $36 per share just two years ago. Climbing back to that level would work out to at least a 60% gain, starting at today's prices. If you think that can't be done, you could look back at the much faster rise in 2013 and 2014 for some velocity guidance. The price swings in this crazy industry may not be very predictable, but they sure know how to bring the heat in both directions. So Micron could very well jump back to $36 in a single year, if recent history is any indication. How about traditional valuation metrics? Let me compare Micron to some other veterans in the chip industry: Ratio Micron Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Forward P/E 9.1 13.8 14.1 Price to Sales (ttm) 1.8 3.1 4.2 Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (ttm) 9.8 17.4 13.2 Data source: YCharts. I'm not necessarily saying that Micron deserves to trade at the same multiples as Intel or Qualcomm, of course. Both of these sector peers are much larger than Micron in terms of annual sales, various types of profit, and market caps. Intel dominates the market for central processors, and Qualcomm holds a similar position in the field of wireless communications, while Micron is only the third-largest player in a highly volatile sector. So yeah, Micron probably deserves a risk-related discount. But the company is on an upward trend right now, and that crazy memory market has settled down significantly in recent years. Several brutal rounds of cyclical shakeouts have led to the largest memory providers swallowing up all the minnows, and Micron is one of the rival-eating survivors. Frankly, I'd be shocked to see another price war in the next couple of years. Based on the table above, you could give Micron a 60% price boost right now and the stock would still look reasonably cheap in the context of large sector peers. Watch Micron get to work on earning back that rebate, and stock prices could surge in a hurry. The key issue here is memory chip pricing, based on the balance between supply and demand in that market. Supply is tighter than demand right now and should remain so for at least a good chunk of 2017 as well. What's next? So yeah, I think that this stock will climb even higher next year. Will it be the best year ever? Probably not -- Micron set a high bar by tripling in 2013 -- but still a very healthy performance indeed. I'll certainly keep a close eye on Micron next year. A 60% gain would place the stock close to what I'd consider fair value in a best-case memory market scenario. At that point, it just might be time to sign off and move my Micron capital to another stock with a longer runway for growth ahead of it. But right now, I'm a happy shareholder. The next year is looking good from where I sit. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel and Micron Technology. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Qualcomm. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

(Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........The city of Rio Rancho and Sandoval County experienced some highs and lows in 2016. Here are 10 of the year’s top stories as selected by the Observer staff: 1. Romero convicted and sentenced in Benner slaying The convicted killer of Rio Rancho Police officer Gregg Benner was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 20 years, on Sept. 30, 16 months after the shooting. “You will die in prison,” said 13th Judicial District Judge George Eichwald as he sentenced Andrew Romero for the Memorial Day 2015 slaying that stunned the City of Vision. The courtroom was filled with police officers and Benner’s supporters. Advertisement Continue reading A week earlier, a jury of nine women and three men found Romero guilty of first-degree murder of a police officer and other lesser offenses for shooting and killing Benner during a traffic stop on Pinetree Road. According to testimony during the two-week trial, moved to Valencia County because of the intense publicity the case received in Sandoval County, Romero shot Benner after the officer pulled over Romero and Tabitha Littles, Romero’s former girlfriend. They were on a two-month drug binge they funded by robbing about 10 business, mainly fast-food restaurants. Romero and Littles were on their way to rob a Twisters when Benner stopped them. Littles was also sentenced on Sept. 30. Eichwald sentenced her to 16 years and she will be able to cut that sentence in half if she behaves well while in prison. “Every night since May 25 has been cold and lonely,” said Julie Benner, the officer’s widow. In November, Eichwald added 40 years to Romero’s sentence under a state law that allows judges to enhance a three-time habitual offender’s sentence. Records show Romero had previously been convicted of crimes including involuntary manslaughter, drug trafficking and aggravated assault. Eichwald added eight years for each of Romero’s five felony convictions in the Benner case. 2 . Hospital mill levy extension defeated at polls Advertisement Continue reading County voters in November rejected the proposed eight-year extension of a 4.25 mill levy to support the two medical centers in Sandoval County. The levy, which has supported operations at Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center, was defeated by a 51.4 percent to 48.5 percent margin. It was passed initially in 2008 with a 53 percent to 47 percent advantage. Sandoval County voters in November rejected the proposed eight-year extension of a 4. 25 mill levy to support the Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal) Generating about $13.5 million annually, the tax has cost the owner of a home with an assessed value of $200,000 about $282 a year. Overall, it has generated about $110 million, which has been almost evenly apportioned between the two hospitals. Advocates for renewing the levy – among them, county commissioners, the Rio Rancho Regional Chamber of Commerce, the mayors of several county communities and the Rio Rancho YES group – argued the hospitals have provided high-quality, close-to-home medical care for county residents, as well as hundreds of new jobs and spin-off economic development. Opponents of the levy, which included the Rio Rancho TEA Party, argued that, by now, the hospitals should have been positioned to pay their own way. “We are disappointed that the mill levy did not pass because without these county funds we may not be able to maintain all the services we provide today and the expanded services we had hoped to provide,” RMC Administrator Angela Ward said after the vote. Club Rio Rancho was reportedly closing its doors, after plans to sell the North Nine golf course for residential development fell through – and the club’s unpaid city water bill topped $300,000. (Rio Rancho Observer) 3. Club Rio Rancho reportedly shuts out the lights Club Rio Rancho was reportedly closing its doors after today, following a year in which plans to sell the North Nine golf course for residential development fell through – and the club ran up a tab of more than $300,000 in unpaid city water bills. Advertisement Continue reading The club and golf course have been a community mainstay for 46-plus years. In April, a Pulte Homes representative presented development plans for the dormant North Nine, proposing a $3.2 million, 145-home development. Amid opposition by a neighborhood group, the North Nine Association, that development would impinge on views and devalue their property, Pulte reduced the number of homes and separated the development into three separate parcels. At the time, club owner Jhett Browne maintained the North Nine sale was critical to keep the golf course open, saying the sale would help pay off $3 million in loans and the money he owed the city for unpaid recycled water bills. The North Nine Association wouldn’t accept Pulte’s plan, indicating it would go to court to stop the needed city zone change for the development. Application for a zone change was never made. The club closed the remaining 18 holes of the course at the beginning of December, according to sources at the country club and former club shareholder Bob Gallagher. Gallagher said Browne stopped watering and maintaining the west nine holes for cost savings in September. The remaining nine holes stopped receiving water on Dec. 1. City spokeswoman Annemarie Garcia said the club owes the city $357,532.53 in water services and penalties. On Dec. 22, Browne alerted club members and employees that the site would cease all operations and shut down on Jan. 1, according to sources at the club and Gallagher.

SandRidge backs away from exploratory drill Oklahoma-based SandRidge Energy in February withdrew its controversial application for a zone change to allow for an oil exploration and production well west of Rio Rancho. Following two months of public meetings and a decision by the Sandoval County Commission to remand SandRidge’s application to the county’s planning and zoning commission for further questioning, the energy company sent a letter to the county administration stating its decision to remove their application. David Kimmel, SandRidge director of communications, said the company planned “to focus its time, energy and resources on its proven MidContinent and Colorado assets.” SandRidge filed the zone change request in November 2015. The company anticipated drilling to a depth of 10,500 feet on two privately owned acres in the Rio Rancho Estates area. The application touched off a major public backlash – large crowds attended meetings at the Sandoval County administrative office in January and February with opponents, concerned about impacts on nearby communities and the environment without sufficient regulations in place – lashing out at the proposed drill. Despite SandRidge’s withdrawal, Sandoval County and City of Rio Rancho officials are both working to create oil and gas ordinances. 5. Economic ups and downs Advertisement Continue reading It was an up-and-down year on the economic development front, with jitter-causing layoff announcements, store closings and the opening of new businesses. In April, Intel Corp. announced plans to lay off about 12,000 employees from its global operations, or about 11 percent of the company’s total workforce, triggering weeks of local anxiety about how the Rio Rancho plant would be affected. The plant had about 1,900 employees at the time, a number that has steadily declined over the past several years. In May, it sent layoff notices to some Rio Rancho employees, but has remained mum about how many workers would be affected. One worker’s notice read that the worker’s employment would be terminated “due to site closures or consolidation” and went on to say “the expected date for the site closure or consolidation is Dec. 31.” The company has continued to decline to discuss workforce or plant changes at any company sites. In June, the Albertsons supermarket on Southern Boulevard closed, a company representative saying, “It was determined it would be best for us to close that location to strengthen our operational efficiencies.” Many of the store’s 80 employees were assigned to other store locations. In July, Hastings announced it was closing and liquidating all locations by the end of October, including its long-time location in Hilltop Plaza. There was brighter news. Advertisement Continue reading Retail development continued in the Unser corridor as well as the Plaza at Enchanted Hills. In June, PCM, California-based technology solutions company, announced plans to move into a portion of the HP building in City Center and bring 224 jobs for a call and sales center. Later that month, Safelite AutoGlass, a nationwide provider of vehicle glass repair and replacement services, announced plans to open a customer contact center in the former Sprint building, creating more than 900 jobs. PCM and Safelite are expected to bring a $34.5 million annual payroll to the city, combined. 6. Parade of elections 2016 featured a seemingly endless parade of political campaigns and elections, with a municipal election and runoff in the spring, primaries in June and a general election in November. Voters also went to the polls to decide an $84 million bond issue for CNM in February and a Rio Rancho Public Schools $60 million bond issue in August. Both measures passed. In the Rio Rancho municipal election in March, city voters approved 10 of 11 proposed charter amendments, rejecting the measure that would have substantially increased the pay for mayors and councilors elected in 2018 and after. Advertisement Continue reading They also approved a $9 million road bond. The election, though, produced only one outright winner in the races for three council seats, with former Councilor Marlene Feuer easily winning in District 4. Former Mayor Jim Owen emerged as the winner for the District 1 council seat in an April runoff against political newcomer Joshua Hernandez. Neither gained more than 50 percent of the vote in their district to win outright in the regular election. Incumbent Lonnie Clayton lost his seat in a runoff with former Councilor David Bency in a bitterly contested race. Highlighting the campaign was a claim Bency made with Rio Rancho police that Clayton had damaged one of his campaign signs. Clayton filed a complaint against Bency for making a false report after police could not substantiate Bency’s claim. Just before the runoff, police filed a misdemeanor false report complaint against Bency. A six-person magistrate court jury found Bency guilty. He was sentenced to one year unsupervised probation and ordered to pay $120 in court costs. There was a non-election change on the governing body as well. Shelby Smith stepped down from his District 5 seat in July. Jennifer Flor was appointed to serve the remaining two years in his term. In November, voters elected three new Sandoval County commissioner: Jay Block of Rio Rancho beat incumbent Nora Scherzinger in District 2; Dave Heil of Rio Rancho topped Alexis Jimenez in District 4; and F. Kenneth Eichwald of Cuba was unopposed in District 5. Two incumbents, Sandoval County Treasurer Laura Montoya and County Clerk Eileen Garbagni, retained their seats. County voters also rejected the proposed extension of a 4.25 mill levy to support Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center, but approved a $21 million flood control bond. Advertisement Continue reading 7. Improvements made to road system Residents saw their city address the deteriorating conditions on some of its most heavily traveled roads as well as rebuild or construct new projects in 2016. A $7.5 million reconstruction of Idalia Road between Iris Road and NM 528 was completed in the fall. The project created a two-lane divided road with storm drain system, bike lanes, sidewalks and curbs and gutters and installation of traffic signal at Idalia and Camino Encantadas. Construction began in November 2015. Shortly after the Idalia reopening, city officials clipped the ribbon marking completion of a $3.25 million segement of Broadmoor Boulevard between Northern Boulevard and Paseo del Volcan. The two-lane extension provides alternative access to Rio Rancho’s City Center and Sandoval Regional Medical Center and officials are hopeful it sparks new development along the Broadmoor corridor. Residents saw the fruits of the road bond issue passed in March when the city completed a $934,188 rehab of Sara Road in December. The project, begun in early October, involved milling three inches of the asphalt, sealing of existing cracks and the laying down of new asphalt. Curb ramps were constructed at intersections to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In late November, work began on the $5 million High Resort Boulevard reconstruction project between Broadmoor and NM 528. About $4 million of the fund derives from the road bond passed in March. The project, which is replacing deteriorating pavement with new pavement, providing new sidewalks and a multi-use path as well as new water lines and updated curb ramps, is scheduled to be finished in May. 8. Pay raises for future elected officials Advertisement Continue reading The Rio Rancho Governing Body adopted an ordinance in August that will raise the pay of city officials elected in 2018 and after. The ordinance sets the mayor’s salary at the most current median household income level for Rio Rancho in 2018 as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Based on 2014 census information, the mayor’s salary will increase from its current $30,402 a year to $59,243. City councilors’ annual salaries will be set at 28 percent of the median household income in 2018, increasing to $16,588. Councilors elected in 2014 (districts 2, 3 and 5) currently earn $15,201 annually while those elected in 2016 (districts 1, 4 and 6) earn $16,127. The council action followed a decision by voters in March rejecting a proposed charter amendment to raise pay for the mayor and city council. The amendment would have raised the mayor’s annual salary to the city’s mean household income of $74,099 and city council members to 35 percent of the mean household income, at $25,934.65. Not long after the pay raise ordinance was approved, the council adopted a resolution moved by Councilor Jim Owen to create a charter review committee to look at the pay question again. Owen said he was concerned about how adoption of the pay raise ordinance might be confusing to voters after the charter amendment was turned down in March. The committee subsequently recommended no changes in the salaries set by ordinance, but proposed putting them in the charter, which would require a public vote before they could be changed. The council did not accept the recommendation and sent the matter back to the committee. Advertisement Continue reading The committee returned to the council without new recommendations and was disbanded in December. 9. A Park (soars) Above the others Rio Rancho’s unique A Park Above, designed to be accessible to children of all abilities, opened ahead of schedule in February. Bryan Stewart helps his 2-year-old daughter, Alexis, enjoy the playground equipment at A Park Above. City officials, community members and dignitaries held a ribbon-cutting ceremony in May to formally celebrate the opening of the Rio Rancho park, New Mexico’s first fully-inclusive and accessible playground. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) The park sits on six acres off Westside Boulevard, across from Rust Medical Center, and features equipment designed to be therapeutic and offer children an opportunity to relax or practice motor skills. The park is complete with special playground equipment, such as swings that are wheelchair-accessible (rather than a seat, they have a platform large enough to hold a wheelchair), as well as a few rules to promote the safety of all children – for example, the only wheels allowed in the park are strollers and wheelchairs, because bicycles and skateboards could potentially frighten those with special needs or cause a collision. Also included are a water splash pad open during the summer, exercise equipment and a dog park, which was built on the same principle of inclusiveness — this time, for canines. A Park Above is the first of its kind in New Mexico, and to celebrate the milestone, Gov. Susanna Martinez was on hand for the official opening in May. The project was headed up by Jennie Schulte Riedl, community chairwoman for the Rio Rancho Rotary Club, after she visited a similar park in Lakeland, Fla., and dreamed of an all-inclusive playground in the City of Vision. In October 2013, the city broke ground for A Park Above and construction began three months later in January 2014. Advertisement Continue reading A Park Above made Albuquerque the Magazine’s 2016 “Best of the City Parks” top-five, as well as the magazine’s list of “Fun Things to Do in Albuquerque.” 10. City settles lawsuit with Curb The Rio Rancho Governing Body in February approved a $280,000 settlement agreement with Curb North Inc., ending a lawsuit filed by the company over the two-year impact moratorium imposed by the city in 2012. Curb North, the developer of the Cabezon subdivision, filed a lawsuit against the city in September 2012, shortly after the governing body approved a 24-month moratorium on residential impact fees and all of commercial impact fees in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. Curb originally sought $5.6 million in damages, arguing that the moratorium rendered accumulated impact fee credits worthless and caused the developer financial harm. Impact fees are charges developers pay to the city to cover the cost of major system-level improvements to handle the growth their developments will bring. Developers can sell impact fee credits to other developers to recover some of their expenses. Although a state district judge dismissed three of four claims against the city in March 2014, the judge held that the moratorium constituted a “government taking” in violation of state law. The court ruled, though, a final judgment would not be issued until it determined the amount of damages, which was to be decided at a trial that has been scheduled in February.

This apparently has to do with the company waiting for Intel's Kaby Lake processors to become available, since they will draw less power hence aiding battery life. Months have passed and today we get a new rumor on the matter, which goes into a little bit more detail. The Surface Pro 5 is now said to be launching in the first quarter of next year, so before the end of March. Additionally, the device will reportedly have a 4K UHD touchscreen and magnetic charging stylus. Pegatron Technology will manufacture the new Surface for Microsoft, and it should have a starting price of $899 - though for that amount of cash you might not be getting the 4K screen, which could be relegated to only the top of the line model costing $1,599.

For the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 13.5 percent, the highest increase since 2013. The Dow finished just under the 20,000 milestone at 19,763 after hitting a record high of 19,988 on Dec. 20. On Friday the index of 30 blue chips declined 57.18 points. The S&P 500 closed with a gain of 9.4 percent for the year to end at 2,238.83, a 10.43 points drop from Thursday's close. The Nasdaq finished the year with a gain of 7.5 percent at 5,383.12, a decline of 48.97. In light trading, the information technology sector led the declines, dropping 1 percent Friday, including Apple, Microsoft and Intel. The top sector this year was energy, which was up 23.4 percent, follow by financials at 19.1 percent and telecommunications services at 17.1 percent. Health care was the only sector at close the year down -- 4.2 percent -- as President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-dominated Congress vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Earlier in the year, the stock market was hurt by a recession scare, Brexit and the U.S. presidential campaign. But stocks have rallied 8 percent since Trump's election on Nov. 8. "U.S. equities are ending 2016 in a reasonably good position," Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, wrote in an email to CNBC. "Prices have been remarkably resilient throughout the year, overcoming early-year weakness and ongoing uncertainty to end the year near all-time highs; the U.S. economy appears to be in a Goldilocks zone; and earnings are on the cusp of increasing." The Dow industrial have nearly tripled since the financial crisis when it hit a low of 6547.05 in March 2009, two months after Barack Obama took office. "Now comes the hard part," said Lew Piantedosi, portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, told The Wall Street Journal. "What are these policies actually going to look like? That's where the true uncertainty lies." U.S. crude oil is now at $53.72 a barrel, up 45 percent in 2016 and its best year since 2009. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show crude oil inventories in the United States increased 614,000 barrels last week. The Federal Reserve didn't raise interest rates until Dec. 14 for the first time since the end of 2015. The target is half to three-quarters percent and the Fed plans to increase rates by another three quarters of a point in three stages in 2017.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Unlocked Core i3 CPU will be late to the Kaby Lake party by Zak Killian  12:30 PM on December 30, 2016 Remember that Intel Core i3-7350K that the rumor mill was talking about a while back? According to a post on Japanese tech news site Hermitage Akihabara, if that CPU exists, it won't be joining the rest of Intel's seventh-generation processors at launch time. The site says that shipments of the new chips have already arrived in shops, but that certain models, including the 7350K, are absent from the lineup. The site seems quite confident that desktop Kaby Lake CPUs will be going up for sale next Friday on January 6. Earlier rumors pegged the Core i3-7350K at around $175, but Hermitage Akihabara lists the chip at 25,000¥ ($214). However, the site also says that the prices it lists are higher than expected due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen. We're enthusiastic about the prospect of an unlocked Core i3 processor here at TR. We've long felt that higher clocks are superior to more cores for most scenarios, and we keep recommending the Core i3-6100 in our System Guides as the budget CPU to have. However, the purportedly high price of the Core i3-7350K makes the rumored chip look a little silly when a Core i5-6600K can be had for just a few dollars more.

Broadwell HD Graphics 5500 Delivering Similar Vulkan/OpenGL Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 30 December 2016 at 11:41 AM EST. 7 Comments With having out a Core i7 "Broadwell" ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop for the MoCA 2.0 network tests, I decided to run some end-of-year graphics tests on this Core i7 5600U system with OpenGL and Vulkan. The last time I had out this particular system with i7-5600 CPU sporting HD Graphics 5500, the Vulkan experience wasn't really working out at that time. But a half-year has passed and now it's in better shape for this low-power ultrabook. I ran tests with the Linux 4.10 and Mesa 13.1-devel Git stacks atop Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64. The HD Graphics 5500 on this i7-5600U ultrabook aren't the fastest, but at 800 x 600 for Dota 2 we see the performance is about the same between the Vulkan and OpenGL drivers. Still close at 1280 x 1024. The performance is rather low, but those are the numbers for those always craving fresh Intel graphics results. Unfortunately no Talos Principle results for Vulkan as the game was hanging in this configuration. Still working on some other fresh tests with Iris Pro Graphics as well as the Skylake HD Graphics that provide for more playable Linux OpenGL/Vulkan gaming experience. Great to see overall though how the Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver has matured this year and is quite a competent driver while the i965 Mesa driver has also advanced in 2016 to supporting OpenGL 4.5, performance optimizations, and other improved functionality. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 30, 2016 at 11:50AM Stephen Hawking calls it the "biggest event in human history." So why are "in-the-know" investors so excited that hardly anyone has heard about "Tier Zero" yet? Because it means they believe there is still time to profit wildly from the global phenomenon that's about to take off. But you should hurry – because after 18 months of extensive research into the subject it's clear that this opportunity may not be around much longer. People are starting to catch on quickly. After traversing the globe from Norway to Las Vegas, meeting with dozens of CEOs and thought leaders, losing countless hours of sleep to research papers and SEC filings, it hit me. All signs were pointing to one little known company at the center of this opportunity. I'm sure you'll share my excitement at this discovery soon. But first, have you ever heard the expression "History doesn't repeat itself. But it rhymes"? Well I think it's hogwash. History DOES repeat itself. I've seen it, and you have, too. As you know, the world has experienced three major tech revolutions over the last 50 years. Each one looks identical. There is a phase of early development, then early adoption, and suddenly skyrocketing usage. Meanwhile early investors get wealthier, and wealthier, and wealthier as the technologies go mainstream. The first was the explosive growth of computer sales. And as you already know, earlier investors in companies like Intel and Microsoft did very, very well, For every $1,000 you put into Intel in their IPO , you'd have over $275,000 today  (and a nice stream of dividend income to boot!). Microsoft IPO investors have done even better, turning $1,000 into over half a million dollars.    Second came the growth of the Internet, connecting our homes, devices, and the world around us. Meanwhile Internet-based companies like Amazon.com and Netflix soared over 40,000%  and nearly 10,000%,  making early investors (I know a few) extremely happy. Most recently we've seen the mobile revolution, which has led to smartphones, tablets, and other countless devices that rely on microchip transistors. Early investors in this revolution (I know a few more!) made a killing on companies like Intuitive Surgical (up more than 3,000%) and Salesforce (up almost 2,000 %). I've spoken with some of those early investors, and after showing them the chart below they all agree – Tier Zero is the next revolution that's taking off. And in many ways it may be the last. By now it's obvious why this opportunity is so thrilling, and you're probably ready to learn the name of the company these early investors think is at the white-hot center of this revolution. Because if Stephen Hawking, my 18 months of research, and those other early investors I spoke to are correct... Tier Zero is going to be an absolutely incredible opportunity – IF you act before mainstream investors catch on.

The Most Viewed Linux Kernel News Stories Of 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 30 December 2016 at 10:27 AM EST. Add A Comment There are just a few more interesting recaps to share before 2016 draws to an end. I figured some of you may be curious about the most-viewed kernel news stories on Phoronix this calendar year. Aside from our routine and original kernel feature overview articles each cycle, here is a look at just the most popular news items pertaining to the Linux kernel that were published on Phoronix in 2016: Btrfs RAID 5/6 Code Found To Be Very Unsafe & Will Likely Require A Rewrite It turns out the RAID5 and RAID6 code for the Btrfs file-system's built-in RAID support is faulty and users should not be making use of it if you care about your data. Is The Linux Kernel Scheduler Worse Than People Realize? A number of Phoronix readers have been pointing out material to indicate that the Linux kernel scheduler isn't as good as most people would assume. Linux 4.7 - Btrfs vs. EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. XFS vs. NTFS Benchmarks Continuing on from yesterday's Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks comparison, here is a wider look at mainline file-systems on the Linux 4.7. File-systems tested on the NVMe SSD included Btrfs, EXT4, F2FS, XFS, and NTFS. Well Known Linux Kernel Developer Recommends Against Buying Skylake Systems Well known Linux kernel developer Matthew Garrett who has led the charge for a number of years about UEFI/SecureBoot issues, poorly secured devices, and more, has taken aim now at Intel's latest-generation "Skylake" systems. Some Distributions Are Already Making Changes To Linux's Scheduler Already it's looking like the research from the recently covered The Linux Scheduler: a Decade of Wasted Cores that called out the Linux kernel in being a poor scheduler is having an impact. The Best Features Of The Linux 4.8 Kernel If all goes according to plan, the Linux 4.8 kernel will be officially released this afternoon by Linus Torvalds. OrangeFS Lands In Linux 4.6 Kernel A new file-system has been merged for the Linux 4.6 kernel. The Thousands Of FIXMEs & TODOs In The Linux Kernel Canonical's Colin King has looked at the number of FIXME and TODO comments within the Linux kernel tree. The Features That Landed So Far In The Linux 4.6 Kernel We are a little more than half-way through the Linux 4.6 kernel merge window so here's a quick look at the new changes and features that have made it into the code-base for this next major kernel release. How Ubuntu 16.10 With Linux 4.8/4.9 Compares To Early 3.x Kernels When having out the Core i5 "Sandy Bridge" HP EliteBook this weekend besides comparing fresh OpenGL numbers to early Sandy Bridge results going back to 2012, I also compared Ubuntu 16.10 / Linux 4.8 and Linux 4.9 compared to older kernel benchmarks I did with the same system. A Stable Linux Kernel API/ABI? "The Most Insane Proposal" For Linux Development For some lighthearted weekend reading and sure to make for some interesting discussions in the forums is what was volleyed today onto the kernel mailing list: "The most insane proposal in regard to the Linux kernel development." It's about shaking up the way the Linux kernel development happens, but almost surely the proposal won't end up resulting in changes. Six Interesting Features Of The Linux 4.6 Kernel If all goes well before the day is through will be the release of the Linux 4.6 kernel. If you've been behind on your Phoronix readings the past few weeks, here are the highlights to look forward to with Linux 4.6.

DJI led the way with Mavic Pro, a gadget that made huge improvements on the size and simplicity of a powerful camera drone. It fits into a jacket pocket while delivering four miles of range and advanced autonomous features. While DJI was climbing to new heights, a lot of its competition stumbled Unfortunately, while DJI was climbing to new heights, a lot of its competition stumbled badly. 3D Robotics, which last year seemed like the most promising competitor to the throne, more or less abandoned the consumer drone market after its Solo drone delivered disappointing sales. The heavy investment and manufacturing snafus that came with creating this product put 3D Robotics on the ropes. GoPro was the other big name company based in the US to try its hand at a drone. There was a lot to like about its Karma drone. It offered a package that combined an action camera, handheld stabilizer, and aerial capture system. And it had the marketing muscle and retail experience to move a lot of product. Sadly, when its drones started falling out of the sky, GoPro quickly recalled the Karma. Drones became a staple prop in YouTube videos and branded experiences Yuneec, a Chinese startup backed by Intel, managed to put out a unit that could autonomously sense and avoid obstacles, putting it on par with DJI. But its Typhoon H, a bulky, six-rotor aircraft that comes in a massive carrying case, was simple too much, too late, to compete with the smaller, more sophisticated units coming to market from DJI. Drones stayed in the public eye, becoming a staple prop in YouTube videos and branded experiences. Disneyland is planning to put them in the sky as a high tech light show, and Samsung paid Casey Neistat to be airlifted by drone around a ski slope. Delivery drones completed a lot of firsts, from a 7-Eleven run in Nevada to a burrito drop in Virginia. Amazon got a package to customers in Cambridge, claiming a total time of 13 minutes between a customer clicking purchase and the package arriving in their backyard. And drones were used for humanitarian missions, helping to move blood across Rwanda and antivenom in rural Australia. 2016 in drones averages somewhere between A+ level successes and some C- stinkers. I’ve got high hopes for 2017, especially if the industry can find ways to continue shrinking the form factor of consumer quadcopters so they feel more like smartphones. It also might be time for some of these companies to think outside the box, bringing what they’ve learned in the sky to land and sea. Drones, like driverless cars, are really an expression of the advances happening in robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Their killer use case for the average consumer is still waiting to be discovered.

Then again, 2016 itself started on a highly optimistic note, having succeeded the bland 2015 and started with the traditional gala event of the tech calendar that was the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. CES 2016 was the January harbinger of what was to come: we thought it'd be a fresh dose of techno optimism, with a shot or two of smarter cars and homes, but it ended up a distressing series of unhappy events. So let's look back on it! (If only for the sake of closure.) HP EliteBook Folio Amelia Holowaty Krales Laptops promised much, but delivered a great deal less When we, The Verge's editorial staff, were having our Verge Awards debate for CES 2016, the richest field of candidates was laptops. There were just so many appealing and attractive new options, each one of them thinner than the other, each a little bit sleeker and more refined. We liked Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Yoga a lot, especially with its gorgeous new OLED screen. Then we were charmed by the HP EliteBook Folio, which looked like a very legitimate Windows alternative to Apple's MacBook - only with the added benefit of two USB-C ports rather than just one. Progress, we thought. My personal highlight from among the bunch was the Razer Blade Stealth, the gaming company's first ever ultrabook, which also capitalized on USB-C's greater bandwidth to introduce an awesome concept: a universally compatible graphics card dock, which would allow mobile gamers to hook up a full-bloodied desktop GPU to their ultraportable laptop. With a pretty, high-resolution display and a handsome matte-black finish, the Blade Stealth promised to be a modular realization of one of the oldest dreams in PC-land: a gaming laptop without performance limitations or enormous size. Related Lenovo’s X1 laptop line gets even better with OLED screens and a folding hinge HP's EliteBook Folio is like a MacBook that runs Windows Razer’s first ultrabook wants to be your only gaming PC Razer Blade Stealth Tom Warren Alas, as 2016 ticked on, it became clear that none of our favored laptop heroes would live up to their initial hype. The Blade Stealth suffered from substantial delays to the Razer Core, the GPU dock that made it more than just another ultrabook, and the Core was mightily priced at $499 ($399 when purchased alongside a Razer laptop). Expected around April, it wasn't until the latter half of the year that the Core was properly available, by which point there was already a fresh revision of the Blade Stealth, though even the September update didn't improve the ultrabook's battery life to the point of competing with better alternatives in the ultralight category. HP's EliteBook Folio turned out to be a case study in the compromises inherent in building such an exceedingly thin machine. Intel's Core M was an inadequate processor for what this 4K laptop was trying to do, and the battery was a letdown too. Together with software issues and a high price tag, these factors combined to make the Folio, the eventual product, a major disappointment relative to the Folio as a CES exhibition item. One trait shared by the EliteBook and Blade Stealth was the absence of an SD card slot - so we can blame these computers for kickstarting the trend that would eventually infect Apple's updated MacBook Pro range later in the year as well. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Tom Warren The ThinkPad X1 Yoga that we coveted at CES offered the fewest unhappy surprises of the bunch. Its OLED display remained a highlight, but it was surrounded by a machine with unsatisfying battery life and a series of smaller issues. With a price tag north of $1,800 just to jump on the OLED bandwagon, the X1 Yoga remained a positive step toward the future of laptops, but not something any of us could feel comfortable recommending as a purchase. Related Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga review: tomorrow's display in yesterday's laptop HP EliteBook Folio review: chasing the MacBook Razer Blade Stealth review: What happens when gamers make a regular laptop? Faraday Future Cars took over the vaporous hype crown Wanna hear a CES joke? Faraday Future. This Chinese-funded EV company came to steal the show at CES, and it promptly did, but that was mostly through bemusement. It didn't have a car to show, other than a hyper-stylized supercar concept, and it only floated a bunch of visionary promises about our future electric mobility. CES 2017 is supposed to be the stage where Faraday finally unveils something approximating a production vehicle, but the company’s buildup to the show has been calamitous. Executives are leaving, funding is dwindling, and the project that appeared transparently vaporous during CES 2016 seems set to completely fizzle out at some point in 2017. Related Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse Two top Faraday Future executives just resigned Another shake-up at Faraday Future, as ‘global CEO’ departs Audi contributed to the sense of unreality around CES autos with its VR car configuration experience. To be fair, that looks like a very compelling application of virtual reality — having people soak up the most realistic visuals of their anticipated future car — though it’s destined for a rather small audience in high-end auto showrooms. For now at least, the VR experience of designing your own Audi is a niche utility for a small group of moneyed individuals. The positive way to look at this, though, is that these VR additions to the acts of purchasing and owning a car seem destined to grow in number and availability. So while this is another example of ephemeral autos, at least it’s a good one. Chevy Bolt The biggest exception to the downbeat notes coming out of CES 2016 has been Chevy’s Bolt. It took The Verge’s Best in Show award by combining affordability with practicality and long range — it’s the closest we’ve yet come to a hassle-free electric vehicle that can truly replace the traditional everyday petrol guzzler. Mind you, the jury’s still out on the Bolt, whose first delivery only just arrived in December 2016, and a full national rollout across the United States won’t happen until the middle of 2017. Related The Chevy Bolt will start at $29,995 after federal tax credit The Chevy Bolt is electric, but that's not the really good part First Chevy Bolt is delivered in Tesla’s backyard Misfit Ray James Bareham Wearables failed to answer the "why does this exist?" question Each and every year at CES, wearable technology has been the court jester of the show. Whether it’s clunky plastic 3D glasses, (bad) Android smartphones transmogrified into enormous Android smartwatches, or a billion of dubious fitness and health-tracking gadgets, you can rest assured the clowniest products will be wearable. The best we could muster during CES 2016 was a roundup of wearables that aren’t ugly. Most trends in 2016 were moves away from wearables. As good as GoPro’s adventure cameras were, it turned out that there weren’t all that many extreme-action enthusiasts, and so the undisputed leader in a nascent category — with an undoubtedly good product — found itself floundering financially. Nikon arrived at CES 2016 with its own action camera, the KeyMission 360, but that spent most of the year as just a promise, and it was only in September that the company announced a price: $499. Let’s just say that the category of wearable action cams isn’t set to grow dramatically anytime soon. Related Don’t expect battery life miracles in wearables anytime soon Those 'mind-reading' EEG headsets definitely can't read your thoughts Three CES wearables that actually aren't ugly The typical CES fodder of weird stuff like EEG headsets was also apparent, but the biggest subset of wearables was the wrist-worn fitness tracker. We most liked the Misfit Ray, primarily because it was stylish enough to be worn without embarrassment, however a major hurdle still holds most other wrist gadgets back. Battery life. The smaller and more elegant a piece of technology becomes, the less space it has to fit a battery on the inside, and our findings from CES 2016 confirmed that this universal rule wasn’t being broken. Until we figure out even more exceptionally power-efficient technology, or one of those magical battery breakthroughs that we keep waiting for, wearables will remain compromised. Dieter Bohn in Fallout 4 It wasn’t all terrible Just like 2016, CES wasn’t a simple black canvas of despair. On the TV front, OLED and HDR technologies stepped forth as the confirmed standards of our future, higher-fidelity visual delights. Netflix announced a major expansion. LG rolled out a rollable display that portends well for our more distant future. Failed mobile operating systems found a new home on TVs, truly wireless earbuds got a year of growth and improvement started on a positive note, and the weird fridges that make life worth living were back in vogue. CES is still the destination to visit when you want to let your imagination about the future of technology run wild, and even as the number of successful commercial products coming out of it remains low, the auguries about where the industry is headed are always there to be found. Here’s hoping 2017 can retain the weird and fantastical edge while delivering a few more products that we can, and actually want to, buy.

Tech Culture by Sean Hollister December 27, 2016 5:00 AM PST @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Here's a New Year's resolution for tech companies: Stop ruining things by releasing them early. Yes, I know it's tempting to test the waters and beat competition to the punch, but what if things go bad? What if your drone falls out of the sky? What if your smartphone explodes? What if someone dies using your app? What if your pocket-monster-chasing game is actually a huge global sensation, but software bugs and missing features keep it from being more than a fad? Enlarge Image The infamous Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Photo by Josh Miller/CNET In 2016, every one of those things actually happened. So maybe 2016 is the year we all learn the lesson. These days, companies expect us to buy unfinished "beta" products and then spend our time helping them work out the kinks. Usually, this pays off because we don't notice minor flaws in the products, or aren't bothered enough to get our money back. We instead just lust after new gadgets, buy into the hype, throw so much money at the next big thing that companies promise even more products and features that they can't deliver on time. Not without taking a few shortcuts, that is. But this year, a whole lot of rushed, unfinished products failed in some pretty spectacular ways -- ways that may make people think twice about trusting the companies that made them. For instance: Would you buy a drone from GoPro, knowing that the company's first drone got pulled from shelves in November for a tendency to fall out of the sky? GoPro recalls Karma drones because of power problems Less than three weeks after going on sale, GoPro's first drone is pulled as the company offers refunds and searches for a fix. by Bridget Carey 1:16 Close Drag How many years do you think it will be before Samsung recovers from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, when apparently a too-big, too-tight battery caused over 100 phones to burst into flames? (Particularly after the supposedly safe replacement phones also caught on fire?) Would you give your children a McDonald's Happy Meal gadget, after the company's cheap-o fitness tracker, introduced in August, was found to irritate some people's skin? How about buying a Samsung or GE washing machine -- after some Samsung models shook themselves to pieces or in the case of GE, caught fire? With so many examples like these in 2016, maybe companies will think twice about rushing their products to market. Galaxy Note 7 fires may be to blame on tight battery An independent engineering consultancy firm says Samsung was too aggressive in the design of the Note 7, taking design risks that led to the phones overheating. by Bridget Carey 1:31 Close Drag Particularly companies that use lithium-ion batteries; between the devastating hoverboard fires, the embarrassing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fires and Intel's overheating Basis Peak fitness tracker -- all three were recalled this year -- you'd best believe brands are going to be extra careful with products that use flammable energy cells. But 2016 wasn't just the year of huge consumer recalls. (Also see: exploding Takata airbag inflators and Cuisinart food processor blades.) Plenty of unfinished products shot themselves in the foot without consumer protection agencies needing to get involved. Would you rely on Tesla's Autopilot self-steering car feature, after this driver's fatal crash while using the beta in May? As one backer put it, "Seriously, @scanadu? So you effectively charged me $200 for the privilege of participating in your private study. #scam" Photo by Scanadu Would you ever buy anything from Scanadu, the company that shipped a $200 (roughly £160 in the UK or AU$280 in Australia) smartphone-connected medical sensor without first getting FDA approval -- meaning those $200 devices are about to become useless paperweights? (The company isn't offering refunds, either.) Will you rush to download the latest Apple software updates, now that you know they can occasionally brick your watch, tablet or phone? Do you trust your Samsung water-resistant phone to actually be water-resistant, after the first batch of Samsung Galaxy S7 Active phones weren't? Do you think maybe Electronic Arts wishes it hadn't shipped an early beta of its big new game, Titanfall 2, only a couple months before launch -- which convinced some of the original games' biggest, most vocal fans to write it off? (Reports suggest the game has sold poorly.) And do you think the creators of Pokemon Go wish they hadn't squandered its massive global popularity on server issues, bugs and missing features that drove players away? Do you think Uber should maybe have tried to work with regulators before it built a fleet of self-driving cars that are now banned from California roads? Enlarge Image Uber had to pull its fleet of self-driving cars from California roads, after the DMV revoked their registrations. Photo by James Martin/CNET It didn't have to be this way. With a little more time in the oven and a little more thought in 2016, these brands might have saved their products, their reputations and maybe even lives in the process. (The creators of Pokemon Go didn't respond to concerns about road safety until two Japanese pedestrians were allegedly hit and killed by truck drivers playing the game -- despite their previous game, Ingress, already having a speed limit feature which could have saved them.) I'm not saying every product has to be fully tested before it gets released to the public. Some, like the voice recognition software that powers the Google Home voice-activated speaker, genuinely need real people to use it for years before it can work well -- and video games like Titanfall 2 can genuinely benefit from player feedback in an early beta release. But too many games use their "betas" as just one more marketing vehicle to help sell people on the final product -- and too many companies aren't testing their physical gadgets properly. (I'm also willing to bet that if Google Home had waited for Netflix support, it would have been much better received.) For their own sake, these companies need to slow down and build better products, but we also need to reward the ones that do. We need to stop throwing our money at ideas, and only spend it on finished products with excellent reviews and solid customer support. We need to be willing to pay extra for a finished, quality product instead of jumping on an early bird deal. And we reviewers need to stop reviewing products based on their potential instead of how they actually work in reality. Let's not give these companies reason to think we'll settle for anything less than the best they have to offer. 40 The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 Share your voice 0 comments Tags Tech Culture Gadgets Pokemon Go Samsung Tesla Uber Related Stories 'Twin Peaks' actress Sherilyn Fenn tweets a cryptic clue Facebook censors nude Neptune statue, writer says Benedict Cumberbatch related to Sherlock Holmes' creator Peter Mayhew to Star Wars fans: 'It's okay to grieve' Close   Discuss: Dear tech companies: Stop shipping unfinished...

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop Hardware System Builders News 9 Asus ROG readying a GTX 1080 laptop that’s less than 17mm thick by Mark Tyson on 30 December 2016, 13:31 Tags: ASUSTeK (TPE:2357), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcoz Add to My Vault: An Asus ROG gaming laptop which combines powerful components and a very slim profile has been spotted. Laptop news site LaptopMedia spotted the device listed as having won a Taiwan Excellence Award for 2017. The new Asus ROG laptop offers a most impressive specification with a surprisingly slim profile. The machine is dubbed the GX501, so it's a refresh of an older model. However, the pictured device doesn't look much like its ancestor. Inside the new Asus ROG GX501 there is a latest generation Intel CPU, likely to be a Core i7-7700HQ thinks the source publication. This machine is built around a 15.6-inch screen with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160 pixels) resolution and Nvidia G-Sync support. Previously people pondered over the value of such high resolution screens in gaming laptops but Asus is leveraging an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU which will definitely be up to some 4K gaming action. As per the headline, probably one of the most eye catching specs of this impressive laptop is its thickness. Asus has managed to create the 'thinnest laptop ever with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU' installed. It is said to be just 16.65mm thick. Compact form factors usually need special cooling considerations, and looking at the picture there's what looks like a large perforated area above the keyboard which is probably designed to let warm air rise quickly away from your PC. In other specs revealed we see that the system supports up to 24GB of DDR4 RAM and is equipped with a PCIe x4 NVMe SSD. The picture also shows a very interesting keyboard / numpad layout where a numpad grid can be toggled to function within the touch-pad area to the right. At the time of writing the Taiwan Excellence Award website designers seem to have removed details concerning the Asus ROG GX501. Pricing and availability are as yet unknown.

Posted by Slogbelly - Fri 30 Dec 2016 22:37 I agree that the huge space between the keyboard and the screen is a bit odd. No touchpad either? That's odd. Posted by RT-XD - Sat 31 Dec 2016 02:28 I think the touchpad is put together with the numpad. Doesn't look like any buttons are there, just a faint print of a numpad… That space between the keyboard and screen is very odd as well.

Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaardskin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. Een uitgebreid overzicht over de veranderingen die we in versie 17 kunnen verwachten is op deze pagina te vinden, dit is de aankondiging voor deze uitgave: Kodi v17.0 “Krypton” Release Candidate 1 We want to close the year 2016 with a blast and as such we are happy to announce this Release Candidate of Kodi v17.0 Krypton. This final Kodi v17.0 will be action packed with a lot of features, changes and bug fixes and we left no stone unturned. Nearly every section had at least some maintenance done to make Kodi better than it already was. First and foremost we sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with answering their questions. Now that is done lets look at the biggest changes that were done.

Het is nu eenmaal zo dat je rekening moet houden met al je gebruikers toch? Dus nee, het gaat hier zeker niet alleen om streaming troep, maar gewoon het gebruik van ADD-ONS en daar is Kodi juist groot door geworden... Jammer dat mensen dan gaan minnen terwijl het gewoon klopt wat ik zeg... Te snel je conclusies trekken en niet verder doordenken dan dat die optie voor ADD-ONS er niet voor niets in zit....

These two Microsoft designed devices have proved popular with their flexibility and portable power, based upon the Intel Skylake architecture. With the launch of Intel's Kaby Lake mobile processors in August many were expecting a thorough refresh of the Surface portable range within short order but Microsoft has yet to satisfy its enthusiasts' new tech hunger. Today a report from Taiwan suggests that the launch of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is planned for Q1 2017. DigiTimes is reporting that Pegatron Technology has been hired to make the new device. However, it notes that Quanta Computer has also been considered as a manufacturer for the next generation Surface tablet hybrid. Quanta's fate regarding the possible contract is not known at this time. There are very few details about what the new Surface Pro 5 might deliver. An obvious upgrade would be the move from the Skylake to the Kaby Lake architecture and we can assume that will happen. As for features, DigiTimes quotes a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report as suggesting Microsoft will equip the Surface Pro 5 with an UltraHD display. A new stylus is expected too, which this time around will be magnetic and wirelessly charged. A couple of days ago it was noted by the same source that Microsoft's top end Surface Studio AiO has sold better than expected. Industry planners estimated the AiOs would sell about 15,000 units in its first period of availability (Q4 2016). The expectation was down to the premium pricing of Microsoft's debut AiO machines. However it looks like double that number have been ordered, so for Q1 2017 Microsoft has ordered a further 30,000 units to be produced.

The leaked photos show a white coloured smartphone with design elements lifted straight from the Lumia lineup, complete with a Lumia-like round camera hump on the rear. The term “Surface Phone” being used here is not a theoretical name that the internet has been waiting for, but the images show the smartphone with the mentioned branding. ‘Surface Phone’ is pegged as the ultimate mobile device that a smartphone user will ever need according to the concept. It is rumoured that Microsoft has been working on perfecting the device ever since they stopped working on the Lumia devices as reported by NokiaPowerUser. Image Credit: NokiaPowerUser We can only predict that the latest image renders belong to the cancelled Intel SoC-based Surface Phone, but it will be amazing if this is the ARM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 along with Windows 10. Microsoft recently demoed its work on bringing the full Windows 10 experience to ARM chipsets with a live demo using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 device. The company further detailed that the full experience will come to devices running Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. According to reports by Softpedia, the company also started a trial production run for the Surface Phone to test out the new model for a possible launch later in 2017. According to the company, it does not want to create just a passable smartphone that has been tried and tested in the market by other manufacturers. Instead, the company wants to focus on products that define a new category and is genuinely exciting for people to use. Something on lines of what Surface Pro, Surface Book and Surface Studio aimed to achieve. The company has not issued any statement confirming or denying the presence of the Surface Phone and should be taken as all other rumours are. According to previous reports, we might finally get our hands on the dream mobile device after the tentative launch of Microsoft Surface scheduled for 2017, but we will have to wait and watch for any new developments.

It’s powered by the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel and comes with support for Bluetooth Audio and VPN (Virtual Private Network) through OpenVPN. This is also the first release of the HTPC-oriented OS to add new AMDGPU video driver for newer AMD Radeon GPUs, but it also updates the graphics drivers for Intel and Nvidia cards, the latter being provided as a mix between Nvidia and Nvidia Legacy drivers, thus supporting old and new Nvidia GPUs. The WLAN drivers and firmware have been updated, too, and the graphics stack is now based on the X.Org Server 1.18 and Mesa 11.2 3D Graphics Library. Other updated components include ALSA 1.1, FFmpeg 2.8, libva 1.7, systemd 229, connman 1.31, libnfs 1.11, libressl 2.2, GNU Binutils 2.26, GCC 5.3, Python 2.7.13, LLVM 3.8, and Glibc 2.23. Being a major release and all that, OpenELEC 7.0.0 introduces official support for the WeTek Core platform by creating a separate build of the OS for this type of Android TV boxes. Other than that, users of OpenELEC 6.0 series are urged to use the Generic build of the distribution if they used the Nvidia_Legacy build before.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon — massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company’s announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack — one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government — that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign — not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. “The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise,” said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government attackers Of course, it’s not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. “We’re increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments.” Yahoo’s security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion — a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two hacks, more than a billion accounts Yahoo didn’t say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn’t been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice — once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can’t be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you’ve changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn’t appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn’t the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don’t have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo’s plans to fall into Verizon’s arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company’s services wouldn’t be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the “new development before reaching any final conclusions.” Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses “definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price,” Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn’t negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon,” the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo’s shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.

The unannounced mid-size Chromebook looked like a fantastic option for Chromebooks, especially with Android apps, but shortly after its first appearance, the listing was taken down. Now, the same model has popped up on Best Buy, this time confirming a few more details and offering up a possible release date. As you may recall, the ASUS C302CA is presumed to be a successor to the ASUS Chromebook Flip from last year, which this listing does confirm. As for specs, it confirms the same Intel Pentium 4405Y chipset (Core m3), 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage as we saw in the previous leak. The display also measures in at 12.5-inch with a 1080p resolution. Like the previous Flip, it also offers a 360-degree hinge which allows users to use the laptop in a tablet mode. The listing also confirms a few other details, such as the dual USB-C ports for charging and data transfer, two full-size USB 3.0 ports, HDMI port, microSD slot, and backlit keyboard. As for pricing, it lands at $499. Unfortunately, the listing was taken down just minutes before the publishing of this article. However, the crucial detail here is that the Best Buy listing gives us a potential release date ─ January 5th. When attempting you purchase the Chromebook with store pickup, the earliest option is January 5th, which is right in the middle of CES 2017, and just a day after the company’s press briefing. Odds are, we’ll see this machine debut at CES 2017, so stay tuned for our hands-on coverage of the device in the coming days.

The model democracy of the Middle East risks transforming into a global pariah on the scale of South Africa when it was in the depths of its apartheid nightmare. After decades of Arab-Israeli diplomacy, the idea of a one-state solution looms anew, as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push their agenda. If it is realized, it would reduce Israel’s Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean, in the not-too-distant future, that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority, with the world on the side of the oppressed majority. The United States would be its only friend and ally — relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond. This seems to be the role that President-elect Trump is carving out for America, and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel. Trump’s ambassador-designate, David Friedman, the President-elect’s longtime friend and bankruptcy lawyer, has spent much of his career advocating and raising money for the one-state concept. His arrival in Israel will only reinforce the dramatic shift toward the more extreme parties in Netanyahu’s ruling coalition that now seem to be calling the shots. It was not always this way. Three months after taking office, on June 14, 2009, just 10 days after a recently inaugurated President Barack Obama gave his landmark Middle East speech at Cairo University, Netanyahu, in a televised speech to his people, embraced a two-state solution. Over the next eight years, Israel has solidified its position as one of the world’s most technologically innovative countries, a bastion of democracy surrounded by an ocean of autocracies or theocracies. Five years ago, World Policy Journal used a basket of indicators to identify Israel, alongside Finland and Singapore as the world’s three most innovative countries. At the time, Israel had the largest number of startups in the world outside the United States — 3,850, or one for every 1,844 Israelis, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. It had more companies listed on America’s tech-heavy Nasdaq than the entire European continent. The pace has only accelerated since then. More importantly, today Israel has more than 250 research units owned by or doing business for multinationals, the vast majority American companies such as IBM, Apple, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Cisco and HP. All of which makes Israel uniquely vulnerable. If Israel pursues the one-state solution, integrating ever larger stretches of Palestinian territory and population, while disenfranchising the people who live there, demographic realities will all too quickly make Jewish people a minority in their own country. Already, Israel’s own census bureau shows a virtually equal number of Jewish and Arab people sharing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And Arab people, largely Palestinians, are expected to outnumber Jewish people by 2020. Neither choice of what would follow under a one-state scenario is particularly appealing. John Kerry described the alternatives in his Wednesday speech: “If the choice is one-state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic, it cannot be both. And it won’t ever really be at peace.” But Kerry did not go far enough in painting the horrors that would result from Israel’s efforts to maintain a Jewish-ruled state, for this Jewish minority would be controlling an increasingly unruly and oppressed majority. The world, apart from the United States, will no longer be on its side. At this point, the South Africa example is most instructive. Recall the state of that country as the campaign to abolish apartheid built up steam — a privileged white minority ruling a black majority in a violent and brutal system. Economic and trade sanctions gradually beginning to strangle this nation that had historically been Africa’s most prosperous. The arrival of worldwide consumer boycotts, campaigns to sell off stock of any company doing business with this pariah state. Recall the list of American companies currently operating in Israel; they would find themselves vulnerable to boycotts and sanctions. Their departure would quickly back Israel into a corner even more isolated than South Africa. Inevitably, a Palestinian Nelson Mandela would emerge — a symbolic freedom fighter who Israel would have to demonize or imprison. I served as speechwriter to Mandela during his first visit to the United States after his release from prison. He was lionized from New York to Los Angeles and confided in me that he had no doubt his suffering was key to the end of apartheid in his country. But if apartheid was toxic merely to South Africa, a one-state solution and a globally blacklisted Israel threatens to be toxic to the entire Middle East. Already, the United States has been marginalized in the latest Syrian ceasefire and peace process — with Turkey and Russia taking the lead. An apartheid system in Israel would risk leaving Russia to assume its long-sought role of dominance across the region, a position as peacemaker that would leave it paramount. On the outside, nose pressed against the glass, would stand a newly powerless United States, with only a single, deeply ostracized friend in the region. The text of the latest Security Council resolution calls on all UN member states “to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967” — language that Netanyahu fears could lead to a surge in boycott and sanctions efforts. The resolution passed the UN Security Council 14 to 0 — with countries from Britain and France, to Russia, China, New Zealand, Egypt, even Ukraine, voting to approve. Trump has set the US on this perilous path — hardly one that would seem calculated to end with the Middle East peace he hopes to broker. His initial statements in support of Netanyahu, along with a series of tweets, have been accompanied by the designation of Friedman as his new ambassador. As it happens, Ronald Reagan, who dined with Friedman’s father, Rabbi Morris Friedman, in 1984 — his son, David seated at his side — was not seduced by the one-state solution. Today, most liberal Israelis also recognize this concept for what it is — an impossible dream. The United States must seek to pull the region back from the brink and come to a similar realization.

Cherlynn Low, @cherlynnlow 12.31.16 in Wearables Comments 865 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google; logo by L-Dopa When the first smartwatches made it to our wrists a few years ago, we were willing to overlook shortcomings because the product category was in its infancy. But the technology has had time to mature, and 2016 should have been an exciting year in this space. Instead, we saw a number of important brands pull out of the smartwatch race; meanwhile Google deferred major updates to 2017. Smaller but significant companies were swallowed by competitors, and the devices that did launch this year were unexciting at best. Smartwatch sales started to decline in the second quarter, and while the all-important holiday shopping numbers haven't been tallied yet, the future isn't looking good for the category. This year's new watches, such as the Apple Watch Series 2, the Fitbit Blaze and a slew of Android Wear watches, were mostly underwhelming, with merely incremental upgrades. Battery life continues to be unsatisfactory, the cases are usually still too thick, and companies still struggle to balance timeless design with futuristic functionality. Google, which originally planned to launch Android Wear 2.0 this year, is pushing that update to early 2017. The new version will apparently allow for apps that can run independently on smartwatches without requiring a companion phone, something that Apple's watchOS 2 has offered since fall 2015. Speaking of Apple, the Series 2 appears to be one of the few smartwatches that did well this year: It's received mostly positive reviews and appears to be selling decently well, although Apple did not respond to queries on actual sales numbers. Traditional watchmakers continued to smarten up their products this year, with one of the most notable being Tag Heuer and its fancy Connected watch. That thing costs a whopping $1,500, and it doesn't offer much more than the other Android Wear watches. Sure, it's a Tag, but when most Android Wear watches cost between $150 and $400, you realize that you're paying $1,200 more for yet another wearable that needs recharging every two days or so, with a display that's middling at best. The only established watchmakers that succeeded at producing decent devices (think Timex and Fossil) did so by avoiding going fully digital, sticking instead to more-conventional analog designs with hidden sensors for basic fitness tracking. Really, then, the watches that did well this year were the hybrids, with the one big exception being the Apple Watch Series 2. Then come the brands that have basically given up on making smartwatches altogether. A Motorola exec recently said the company is not working on a successor to last year's Moto 360, because it just doesn't "see enough pull in the market" to justify developing an updated model. That this kind of sentiment is coming from Motorola, of all companies, is telling. After all, the Moto 360 was the first Android Wear watch to have a round face and is one of the most well-received smartwatches running Google's software. Similarly, this year Microsoft discontinued its Band fitness wearable. Although it's more of an activity tracker, the Microsoft Band always toed the line, what with its color touchscreen and smartwatch-like features such as phone notifications and third-party app support. Unlike Motorola, however, Microsoft never explained its exit from the field, although it continues to support its suite of health apps that can run on other devices. One of the biggest signs that smartwatches are in trouble, though, was industry pioneer Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit for the modest sum of about $40 million. Back in its heyday, Pebble reportedly received bids from Citizen and Intel for $740 million and $70 million, respectively. The startup declined both suitors and went on to launch a new line of fitness-focused smartwatches this year. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 raised $12 million on Kickstarter, beating the $1 million funding goal. Despite the company's fundraising successes, Pebble failed to resolve its financial woes and eventually accepted Fitbit's offer. With so much consolidation in the smartwatch space, the future of the category looks gloomy. Less competition can mean less innovation, which can result in products growing stale and eventually fading altogether. Still, there have been developments in 2016 that could give the industry a boost. Startup Matrix Industries came up with a way to use body heat to power a smartwatch, which could eliminate (or at least alleviate) the problem of inadequate battery life. Plus, with Android Wear 2.0 slated to arrive early next year, the next generation of smartwatches will likely become more functional, giving users more reason to wear them. We also saw a few watches this year that let wearers control Amazon's Alexa from their wrist, although they ran obscure independent operating systems that barely had third-party app support. The Alexa integration means that these watches can access more than 2,000 so-called skills, letting you do things such as turn on your smart lights or thermostat, ask how much you've spent at specific stores, or buy many, many pairs of socks. You can't do most of that yet with Android Wear's OK Google command, but Alexa's expansion into watches could spur Google to improve its own assistant. So 2016 wasn't a great year for smartwatches. In fact, it was a disappointing 12 months that don't bode well for the future of the category. But there are enough upcoming potential enhancements that the industry could be revived. Components could also get smaller and more powerful over time, as they did with smartphones, eventually leading to sleeker frames housing more full-featured systems. But that's something to look forward to in the future. As for this year's smartwatches? Goodbye, and good riddance. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

Gadgets 4 0 0 December 31, 2016 Is Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date Right Around The Corner? Daryl Deino The release of the Surface Pro 5 could be coming up very soon. BGR has the news. “A new report from Asia now says that the Surface Pro 5 is coming in the first quarter of 2017,” claims columnist Chris Smith, who adds that the new 2-in-1 tablet will feature an Ultra HD display and a stylus with magnetic charging abilities. Pegatron Technology is allegedly manufacturing the device, which has been hotly anticipated ever since the success of the Surface Pro 4. Currently, there are several Surface Pro 4 sales with as much as $300 off. The device has received fantastic reviews since its release in October of 2015. Tech Radar says is iterative in the best sense. “Has Microsoft at last crafted a tablet that can reasonably, without considerable compromise, replace your laptop? Short of going back to the drawing board on the battery, this looks as close as it’s going to get.” The Surface Pro 4 has received excellent reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] The review especially praises the Surface Pro 4’s screen, the vastly improved Type Cover, and the improved Surface Pen. The only major criticism is the battery life, which a lot of others have complained about. Digital Trends also gave the Pro 4 a near perfect review. “The Surface Pro 4 is a microcosm of the change Microsoft is trying to spur inside its own walls. Time and time again, it missed the opportunity to leap on a new trend in consumer technology. But not with Surface. This time, Microsoft is a leader. It’s setting the trend. And unlike its new competitors, it’s had a few years to work out the kinks.” According to Trusted Reviews, the long wait for the Pro 5 will be worth it. “A new report claims that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will feature a 4K Ultra HD display, which would be a first for the series. By contrast, the Surface Pro 4 has a maximum 2,736 x 1,824 pixel resolution.” The article adds that the standard version of the Pro 5 may not have the 4K panel, but Microsoft might offer the display as a paid-for upgrade — this is what companies such as HP and Lenovo have been doing. This might not be a big deal to many consumers as the current 2,736 x 1,824 display is considered stunning. However, Trusted Reviews reveals that there will be a major upgrade on the processor for the Surface Pro 5. “It’s also claimed that the Surface Pro 5 will feature Intel’s new 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors,” claims columnist Sean Keach. The Kaby Lake processors will especially help with battery life since 4K screen eats up a lot of battery power. Still, there is a lot of excitement over the Surface Pro 5 on Twitter. Lots of rumours on surface pro 5 what I want are wireless charging for pen and device plus external graphics support and I am happy. — Arul (@arulprakash) December 7, 2016 I want a Surface Pro 5 for Christmas. #MicrosoftRewards #MicrosoftEvent #MicrosoftAzure — Maria (@acknowledgeit) December 21, 2016 The Dell XPS 13 is expected to turn into a tablet. [Image by Daryl Deino] The release of the Surface Pro 5 won’t come without any competition. There have been many Surface Pro 4 clones released over the past year that have not been threats to Microsoft. However, as PC Magazine reported, Dell will likely introduce a convertible tablet version of its highly successful Dell XPS 13. Some rumors have the upcoming Dell XPS 13 tablet being released with a digital pen. As the Inquisitr reported a couple months back, Apple’s next 12-inch MacBook could see Apple Pencil support, making it the first OS X device to do so. Judging by all the rumors, which device would you rather have — the Surface Pro 5, the Dell XPS 13 (tablet version), or the upcoming MacBook? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Shares of Buy rated Dow Chemical have gained 9.5% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified industry, which has gained 7.4% over the same period. The Zacks analyst likes the company’s sustained strong growth fundamentals in its core end-use markets, which is believed to have played a major role in boosting the company over the past few months. Dow should continue to benefit from its cost-cutting and aggressive portfolio management actions. The company is also moving forward with its planned mega-merger with DuPont, which is expected to create significant synergies. (You can read the full research report on Dow Chemical here.) Alphabet’s shares have increased 3.1% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet-Services industry, which has rose 2.3% during the same time frame. Alphabet has shown good execution to date, more or less maintaining its dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market. The Zacks analyst likes its focus on innovation, strategic acquisitions and Android OS, which should continue to generate strong cash flows. However, growing competition and legal hassles remained as major concerns. Also, the tech giant is speculated to witness escalation in costs following significant investment in mobile, cloud, devices and digital goods. (You can read the full research report on Alphabet here.) Shares of AT&T have surged 24% year to date, slightly underperforming the Zacks Wireless National sector, which has gained 24.4% over the same period. AT&T operates in a saturated wireless market where spectrum crunch is a big issue. Moreover, loss in access lines, stringent regulatory measures and union issues are major headwinds. However, the Zacks analyst likes the launch of its DirecTV Now, which enabled the company to foray into the OTT space. Moreover, if the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T goes through, the combined entity will become a major player in the consolidated telecom-media space. Collaboration with Intel Corporation will also develop new software-centric network technologies. (You can read the full research report on AT&T here.) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Apple (AAPL), Franklin Resources (BEN) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

American Airlines (AAL) Gains on Bullish Q4 Unit Revenue View Though positive on American Airlines' bullish view on unit revenues in Q4, the covering analyst expects the recent labor deals to hurt the company's near-term earnings. T-Mobile's (TMUS) Network Plans Bode Well, Risks Remain The Zacks analyst believes that T-Mobile will benefit from its solid network expansion plans. However, lawsuits and fines by regulatory authorities remain as concerns. Apple's (AAPL) IPhone 7 and India Expansion Plans Promising Per the covering analyst, though Apple's iPhone demand remains troubled, Apple's expansion in India and growing Apps Store and Services business hold promise. Baxter's (BAX) Cyclophosphamide Sales Hurts Amid Acquisition Plans The covering analyst thinks that the deal of acquiring Claris Injectables is a positive. However, lower cyclophosphamide sales is likely to hurt the company's top line in the near term. Read More Moody's (MCO) Focuses on Growth, Legal Woes Persist Per the Zacks analyst, diverse operations & acquisitions will aid Moody's growth. Yet, a key hurdle remains that DoJ may file a suit against it tied with RMBS & CLO ratings assigned before crisis. Southwestern Energy (SWN) Raises 2016 Output Guidance The covering analyst appreciates Southwestern Energy's increased 2016 production guidance as oil & gas prices have started gaining momentum. However, the company's high debt load raises concern. New Upgrades Dick's Sporting (DKS) Gains on Solid Growth Strategies Per the Zacks analyst, Dick's Sporting has been gaining from its growth strategies that are focused on expansion of store base as well as eCommerce footprint, which will further boost its top line. SunTrust (STI) Focuses on Revenue Growth, Rises Prime Rate According to the covering analyst, SunTrust's several initiatives to improve revenue growth are commendable. Also, the company raised its prime lending rate to 3.75%. Life Point Health (LPNT) Poised to Grow on Strategic Buyouts The Zacks analyst believes Life Point Health to grow on acquisitions of well-positioned hospitals in faster growing areas of the U.S.; strong balance sheet, cost control measures are other positives New Downgrades St. Jude's (STJ) May Get Affected by Sluggish CRM According to the Zacks analyst, sluggish conditions in the Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) markets and steep market competition might poise major headwinds to St Jude's performance in the near term. Altria (MO) Faces Declining Volumes; Loses Share in Vapor The covering analyst believes that declining volumes, high excise taxes and strict anti-smoking regulations will hurt Altria's business. Altria is also losing market share in the smokeless category. Crane Co. (CR) Faces Macro Headwinds Over the last month, Crane Co.'s shares underperformed Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry due to issues like strong U.S. dollar, stiff rivalry and uncertain global economic conditions.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Tablet Microsoft to launch Surface Pro 5 in Q1 2017 Tablet Microsoft to launch Surface Pro 5 in Q1 2017 By Bindu Nair - Dec 31, 2016 Microsoft’s last Surface Pro came out in October 2015, leaving a lot of eager fans wondering when the next entry in the series would show up. A new DigiTimes report now claims that the new 2-in-1 will be launched in the first quarter of 2017. If true, the rumored Surface Pro 5 will likely make its debut before the end of March next year. The publication itself bases its Q1 2017 prediction on an Economic Daily News (EDN) story. The latter adds that the hybrid will probably feature an Ultra HD screen and ship with a magnetic charging stylus. Pegatron Technology has reportedly bagged the rights to manufacturing the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft has also supposedly considered adding Quanta Computer as a production partner but is yet to confirm this. The article also mentioned that the brand’s Surface Studio is experiencing strong sales momentum which will benefit Pegatron’s performance. Also Read: Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation, welcomes Google to .NET A March unveiling falls in line with a previous rumor which had alleged that the Microsoft device was coming out in spring 2017. The long delay supposedly came about because the company was awaiting the arrival of the latest 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors from Intel. The SoCs are apparently less demanding when it comes to power, translating to a healthier battery life. The Surface Pro 5 may additionally set people back by $899 for its basic model and go upwards to a $1599 price tag for the top-of-the-line one. We’ll keep you updated as and when more information about Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 emerges out of the woodwork.

There are Ultrabooks on the market that are thicker than that, so the rumor that ASUS is cramming in a GeForce GTX 1080 inside has us excited.   Not only that, but we should see Intel's new Core i7-7700HQ processor, up to 24GB of DDR4 RAM, and super-fast PCIe x4-based NVMe SSD. We should expect ASUS to unveil the GTX 1080-powered gaming notebook next week at CES 2017. NEWS SOURCES:Nextpowerup.com Recommended for You Dell's new XPS 13 is a surprise 2-in-1 foldable tablet...

The new SFF PC not only packs high-performance components, such as the latest-generation CPU and GPU, but it uses desktop-class components and could be upgradeable. High-performance PCs in small form-factor are not rare nowadays: various PC makers use mobile CPUs and GPUs to build such systems. Such computers demonstrate high-performance out-of-the-box, but their upgrade strategy is tricky because it is not easy to get MXM GPUs or mobile CPUs in retail. When developing the GIGABYTE Gaming GT desktop (GB-GZ1DTi7-1080-OK-GW and technically this PC belongs to the Brix family), engineers from GIGABYTE wanted to create a product that could use widely available processors and graphics cards and thus potentially offer an upgrade path to the owners. The GIGABYTE Gaming GT desktop is not really a miniature system: it measures 276×384×128 mm and is approximately 10 liters in volume, which makes it just larger than Sony’s first-generation PlayStation 3. The PC is based on a custom motherboard (210×205 mm) that is a bit larger than Mini-ITX, but is still smaller when compared to microATX or FlexATX. The system uses a dual-chamber design (CPU, DRAM, SSD are located on  one side of the PC, graphics card and other 2.5” storage devices are on the other side), but the chambers are not isolated completely because they use the same airflows generated by two system fans (we do not know how large they are, but theoretically they may be of 90 mm in diameter). It is noteworthy that the PC has an automated exhaust system that opens up exhaust flippers at the top of the computer when it needs to cool down the components. The chassis can accommodate any double wide graphics card with a maximum size of 280 mm in length and 41 mm in depth, but nothing too custom with regards heatpipes and backplates because the space is constrained. GIGABYTE will ship the Gaming GT desktop with its own GeForce GTX 1080 G1 Gaming 8 GB card, but they say the key thing is that it can be updated later. Since the card faces downwards, it has to use custom cables (bundled) to connect to displays. Audio and Ethernet cables also have to be angled, but at least it is not a big problem to find such cables in retail. On the bright side of things, the Gaming GT desktop uses a 400 W FlexATX PSU, which could be upgraded if needed. GIGABYTE Gaming GT Spefications   GB-GZ1DTi7-1080-OK-GW CPU Intel Core i7-6700K Quad Core with HT 4.0 GHz/4.2 GHz 91 W PCH Intel Z170 Graphics GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 G1 Gaming 8 GB GDDR5X 2560 stream processors 160 texture units 64 raster operations pipelines Memory  32 GB of DDR4 (2×16 GB DDR4) Storage 240 GB SSD (PCIe/SATA?) 1 TB 2.5" HDD (7200 RPM) 1×2.5" bay for HDD/SSD (SATA) Wi-Fi Intel 1×1 Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165NGW 802.11ac + BT Ethernet Rivet Networks Killer E2400 Gigabit LAN Display Outputs 1 × DVI-D DL 1 × HDMI 2.0b 1 × HDMI 1.4 (uses iGPU) 3 × DisplayPort 1.4 Audio 5.1-channel audio Realtek ALC1150 codec TI Burr Brown OPA2134 operational amplifier USB 5 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 1 × USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) 1 × Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) Other I/O - Dimensions 276 mm × 384 mm × 128 mm 10.86 × 15.11 × 5 inches PSU FlexATX 400 W OS Windows 10 Home The custom motherboard of the GIGABYTE Gaming GT PC is based on the Intel Z170 PCH and thus supports all LGA1151 processors, including the upcoming Kaby Lake chips. The manufacturer will ship the system with the Intel Core i7-6700K CPU (so, overlocking seems to be possible, but keep in mind temperatures and noise), but eventually the chip might be switched to something more powerful. The GIGABYTE Gaming GT PC will come with 32 GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory, a 240 GB SSD (M.2 form-factor, but no word on performance), a 1 TB HDD with a 7200 RPM spindle speed and an additional 2.5” bay for an extra drive. For those, who are not satisfied with an M.2 SSD and two 2.5” HDDs/SSDs, GIGABYTE even installed one Thunderbolt 3 port to connect external high-performance storage devices or special-purpose hardware. When it comes to other I/O, then the Gaming GT desktop offers a dual-band 1×1 802.11ac + BT 4.2 wireless module, Gigabit Ethernet (Killer E2400), five USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) port, 5.1-channel audio (the Realtek ALC1150 with the TI Burr Brown OPA2134 amplifier) and so on. Finally, to give its Gaming GT system a distinctive look, GIGABYTE installed a series of RGB LEDs on top of it. The LEDs can work in different modes and can be controlled using the company’s Ambient LED application.   Pricing and availability dates for the GIGABYTE Gaming GT SFF PCs were not available at press time. Keep in mind that actual configuration of the PC will differ based on the regions, which means that their prices will vary as well. Chances are we'll see it at CES next week.

POST A COMMENT 33 Comments View All Comments baal80 - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link Is 400W PSU really going to be enough for this monstrosity? Reply SodaAnt - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link Probably. The CPU doesn't even crack 100W, the mobo and drives and assorted other things probably use 20-30W, which leaves a bit over 250W of headroom for the GPU, which should be just about fine with a GTX 1080. No real headroom for overclocking, but otherwise should be fine. Reply ImSpartacus - Saturday, December 31, 2016 - link A 1080's tdp is only 180W, right? Even if the actual power limit is a little higher (I know Nvidia has done that I the past), it seems like everything is good. You might not want to cram a 250W-class card in there like a hypothetical 1080 Ti. Reply Byte - Friday, December 30, 2016 - link So do I need to open those top flaps when I game!?!?!

Reply ciparis - Monday, January 02, 2017 - link I can't imagine that the "automated" part is anything more than "opens when the air pressure below it pushes it open" -- i.e., when the fans are running fast enough to generate the air pressure (which would not need to be much at all). Reply nagi603 - Sunday, January 01, 2017 - link I have a 1080 with a 4770K running and a lot of other stuff (multiple SSDs, capture card, etc). Depends on the quality of the PSU. I have an old Seasonic X-400 Gold, and it does not have any issue. Also didn't have an issue with a 290X.

Never grow desensitized to this. https://t.co/tNSlkNPBgt— Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 30, 2016 Trump praised Putin on Friday for deciding not to retaliate against a series of measures ordered by President Obama the previous day. The sanctions announced by the Obama administration were in response to the Moscow-backed hacking of Democratic groups whose stolen documents were published in the months leading up to Trump's electoral win. ADVERTISEMENT Those measures include sanctions against Russia's two leading intelligence services and four top officers; the ejection of 35 Russian intelligence operatives and their families from the U.S.; and the closing of two estates in New York and Maryland believed to be used by Russia for intelligence activities. On Friday, Russian officials threatened retaliatory measures, but Putin said he would instead wait until the start of the Trump administration.

The measures announced Thursday by President Barack Obama, who accused Moscow of "efforts to harm US interests," include the expulsion of 35 intelligence agents and financial sanctions on Russia's top intelligence agencies. Obama also warned of additional, unspecified actions "at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized." Analysts say Washington is seeking to punish Russia and warn other nations against taking similar action. "While the direct impact of the actions may be limited, it puts a marker in the sand (or silicon) that hostile cyber activity targeting the US has consequences," said Frank Cilluffo, who heads the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. "In addition to responding to Russia's activities, it also puts others on notice, signaling that one cannot turn to significant cyber attacks with impunity," he said. "It also serves as a starting point for articulating a set of strategies and policies we desperately need... a cyber deterrence strategy." - Avoiding escalation - While US officials have boasted of their ability to use "cyber weapons" when appropriate, security analysts say such a course of action is unlikely because of the risk of escalation -- from more dangerous cyberattacks into the possible use of traditional, deadly weapons, or "kinetic" warfare. "I don't think you'll see the use of cyber weapons," said James Lewis, a senior fellow specializing in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. "There is a strong desire to avoid escalating this conflict." Lewis said Obama's actions are appropriate "as a first step" and in light of Russia's actions, and that any further measures -- which Obama said may be forthcoming -- could be restrained. "The Russians didn't attack us -- they used coercion, espionage, politics -- and we could do the same thing," he said. Susan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution fellow and editor of the national security blog Lawfare, said she expects a further "nonpublic" response, possibly in the cyber domain, to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House announcement "is a welcome and sufficient move, but only if it is paired with some additional nonpublic countermeasure," Hennessey said. She added that while Washington may want to demonstrate to Moscow its capacity for cyber actions, it also would want to avoid establishing a norm for cyber disruption that other nations could follow. This would likely rule out a spectacular hack attack or release of embarrassing information. But Hennessey said she expected a response "to be potentially scary to Kremlin officials to let them know we can reach places they didn't think we could reach." Steve Grobman, chief technical officer at Intel Security, agreed that Obama's measures are intended to send a message without sparking a crisis, and added that if any cyber measures are implemented, they should be carefully calibrated. "The covert offensive cyber component must be well thought out and executed such that it is precise and does not inflict collateral damage on non-target systems," he said. "Escalation of offensive cyber activities by either party could lead to a kinetic conflict." - What happens now? - It remains unclear what impact the actions will have as Obama prepares to leave office in three weeks, when Donald Trump takes the oath of office. Claude Barfield, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argued that Obama's "dawdling and agonizing for months over Russian cyber intrusions" could have "damaging consequences for cyber deterrence policy." "The Obama administration had claimed that it did not want to retaliate against the Russians before the election for fear of provoking further disruption of the campaigns," Barfield said in a blog post. "But it waited a full month after the election before the president finally ordered a full review of the Russian attack by the entire US intelligence apparatus." This suggests "that the president and his security advisers aim to make such a tight case that it will be impossible for the next administration to ignore the evidence or back away from the sanctions," Barfield said. But he noted that "it will be critical for the government to improve US cyber defenses moving forward if we are to prevent similar incidents from happening in the new year and beyond."

MUST WATCH Back-to-back speeches from the US and Israel. 02:23 Story highlights David Andelman: One-state solution could reduce Palestinians to a permanent underclass Jewish minority would be ruling Muslim majority, with the world siding with oppressed majority, he writes David A. Andelman, editor emeritus of World Policy Journal and member of the board of contributors of USA Today, is the co-author, with the Count de Marenches, head of the DGSE, of "The Fourth World War: Diplomacy and Espionage the Age of Terrorism." Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)Israel, and by extension the United States, are poised at the entrance to a dangerous path. The model democracy of the Middle East risks transforming into a global pariah on the scale of South Africa when it was in the depths of its apartheid nightmare. After decades of Arab-Israeli diplomacy, the idea of a one-state solution looms anew, as conservative elements in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition see the arrival of Donald Trump and his new ambassador to Israel as an opportunity to push their agenda. If it is realized, it would reduce Israel's Palestinian population to a permanent underclass and mean, in the not-too-distant future, that a Jewish minority would be ruling a Muslim majority, with the world on the side of the oppressed majority. David A. Andelman The United States would be its only friend and ally -- relegating Washington to a role equally isolated from mainstream opinion throughout the region and far beyond. This seems to be the role that President-elect Trump is carving out for America, and the role that Netanyahu is skirting perilously close to for Israel. Read More Trump's ambassador-designate, David Friedman, the President-elect's longtime friend and bankruptcy lawyer, has spent much of his career advocating and raising money for the one-state concept. His arrival in Israel will only reinforce the dramatic shift toward the more extreme parties in Netanyahu's ruling coalition that now seem to be calling the shots. It was not always this way. Three months after taking office, on June 14, 2009, just 10 days after a recently inaugurated President Barack Obama gave his landmark Middle East speech at Cairo University, Netanyahu, in a televised speech to his people, embraced a two-state solution. JUST WATCHED Keyes: Israel committed to two-state solution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keyes: Israel committed to two-state solution 07:45 Over the next eight years, Israel has solidified its position as one of the world's most technologically innovative countries, a bastion of democracy surrounded by an ocean of autocracies or theocracies. Five years ago, World Policy Journal used a basket of indicators to identify Israel, alongside Finland and Singapore as the world's three most innovative countries. At the time, Israel had the largest number of startups in the world outside the United States -- 3,850, or one for every 1,844 Israelis, according to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center. It had more companies listed on America's tech-heavy Nasdaq than the entire European continent. The pace has only accelerated since then. More importantly, today Israel has more than 250 research units owned by or doing business for multinationals, the vast majority American companies such as IBM, Apple, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Cisco and HP. All of which makes Israel uniquely vulnerable. If Israel pursues the one-state solution, integrating ever larger stretches of Palestinian territory and population, while disenfranchising the people who live there, demographic realities will all too quickly make Jewish people a minority in their own country. Already, Israel's own census bureau shows a virtually equal number of Jewish and Arab people sharing the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And Arab people, largely Palestinians, are expected to outnumber Jewish people by 2020. JUST WATCHED Israel plans more settlements Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Israel plans more settlements 07:07 Neither choice of what would follow under a one-state scenario is particularly appealing. John Kerry described the alternatives in his Wednesday speech: "If the choice is one-state, Israel can either be Jewish or Democratic, it cannot be both. And it won't ever really be at peace." But Kerry did not go far enough in painting the horrors that would result from Israel's efforts to maintain a Jewish-ruled state, for this Jewish minority would be controlling an increasingly unruly and oppressed majority. The world, apart from the United States, will no longer be on its side. At this point, the South Africa example is most instructive. Recall the state of that country as the campaign to abolish apartheid built up steam -- a privileged white minority ruling a black majority in a violent and brutal system. Economic and trade sanctions gradually beginning to strangle this nation that had historically been Africa's most prosperous. The arrival of worldwide consumer boycotts, campaigns to sell off stock of any company doing business with this pariah state. Future of US relationship with UN in doubt (Opinion) Recall the list of American companies currently operating in Israel; they would find themselves vulnerable to boycotts and sanctions. Their departure would quickly back Israel into a corner even more isolated than South Africa. Inevitably, a Palestinian Nelson Mandela would emerge -- a symbolic freedom fighter who Israel would have to demonize or imprison. I served as speechwriter to Mandela during his first visit to the United States after his release from prison. He was lionized from New York to Los Angeles and confided in me that he had no doubt his suffering was key to the end of apartheid in his country. But if apartheid was toxic merely to South Africa, a one-state solution and a globally blacklisted Israel threatens to be toxic to the entire Middle East. Already, the United States has been marginalized in the latest Syrian ceasefire and peace process -- with Turkey and Russia taking the lead. An apartheid system in Israel would risk leaving Russia to assume its long-sought role of dominance across the region, a position as peacemaker that would leave it paramount. On the outside, nose pressed against the glass, would stand a newly powerless United States, with only a single, deeply ostracized friend in the region. What did John Kerry's parting shot on Middle East mean? The text of the latest Security Council resolution calls on all UN member states "to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967" -- language that Netanyahu fears could lead to a surge in boycott and sanctions efforts. The resolution passed the UN Security Council 14 to 0 -- with countries from Britain and France, to Russia, China, New Zealand, Egypt, even Ukraine, voting to approve. Trump has set the US on this perilous path -- hardly one that would seem calculated to end with the Middle East peace he hopes to broker. His initial statements in support of Netanyahu, along with a series of tweets, have been accompanied by the designation of Friedman as his new ambassador. As it happens, Ronald Reagan, who dined with Friedman's father, Rabbi Morris Friedman, in 1984 -- his son, David seated at his side -- was not seduced by the one-state solution. Today, most liberal Israelis also recognize this concept for what it is -- an impossible dream. The United States must seek to pull the region back from the brink and come to a similar realization.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 2016: As The Hardware World Turns 22 Comments by: Brian Benchoff December 30, 2016 Soon, the ball will drop in Times Square, someone will realize you can turn ‘2018’ into a pair of novelty sunglasses, and the forgotten mumbled lyrics of Auld Lang Syne will echo through New Year’s Eve parties. It’s time once again to recount the last 366 days, and what a year it’s been. Arduino got into an argument with Arduino and Arduino won. We got new Raspberry Pis. Video cards are finally getting to the point where VR is practical. The FCC inadvertently killed security in home routers before fixing the problem. All of this is small potatoes and really doesn’t capture the essence of 2016. It’s been a weird year. Want proof 2016 was different? This year, Microsoft announced they would provide a Linux ‘shim’ with every version of Windows. By definition, 2016 was the year of the Linux desktop. That’s how weird things have been in 2016. Man, 2016 Sucked, Didn’t It? By all accounts, 2016 wasn’t a good year. David Bowie, Alan Rickman, Carrie Fisher, Antonin Scalia, Morley Safer, George Martin, Marvin Minsky, Keith Emerson, Doctor Heimlich, George Michael, Prince, Muhammad Ali, Gordie Howe, Janet Reno, Elie Weisel, Gene Wilder, Kimbo Slice, Erik Bauersfeld (voiced It’s a Trap), Anton Yelchin, Kenny Baker, Arnold Palmer, Leonard Cohen, Harambe, Fidel Castro, John Glenn, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Alan Thicke all passed away this year. Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died at the predictably young age of 46. Lemmy lived harder and faster than anyone and beat this terrible year by three days. In the political sphere, 2016 will go down as the start of something. It’s far too early to tell what the end result will be, but between Brexit, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the release of the Panama Papers, a failed Turkish coup, and the presidential election in Gambia, 2016 was a year without parallel. Historians and sociologists are beginning to opine on this year, with the first drafts of the history books citing 2016 as the beginning of a populist revolution. Right now, only one thing is clear: Twitter somehow played a part. I would like to point out we had absolutely no political coverage at all. You’re welcome. The absence of anything political was an editorial prerogative, and by our judgment was the best thing to do. Like our conscious decision not to embed tweets into posts, it’s one of the many editorial decisions we make that goes without thanks or recognition. It would have been so easy and very profitable to pump out a few half-baked opinion pieces on the US presidential election this year. The word ‘trump’ is a verb, and could be easily dropped into a few very clever headlines. This level of restraint deserves, I think, a few pats on the back. Oh yeah, the Cubs won the World Series, Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature, we’re going to get a great NOFX album real soon, and the trend of over-hopped beer is finally coming to an end. It doesn’t balance the rest of the year, but it’s something, right? 2016 In 3D Printers 2016 was the year 3D printing started to recover from Makerbot, with advances seen in both very low-end printers and the slow but steady rise of dual (and quad) extrusion. Last year, a good $200 3D printer would have been inconceivable. At CES last January, Monoprice announced a $200 3D printer. The Monoprice MP Select Mini was really just a rebadge of the Malyan M200, but holy crap this thing is awesome. This printer is cheap at just $200, but it’s more than capable of handling anything you could throw at it. It has a 32-bit controller board, and save for a few upgrades (PEI sheet for the bed, maybe throw a larger stepper in the extruder), this printer would be worthwhile at twice the price. 2016 was the year we started to see usable dual extrusion on desktop 3D printers. Dual extrusion isn’t a new thing — it was available on the plywood Makerbots back in the day. Dual extrusion that worked well is another thing entirely. At this year’s MRRF, E3D released Scaffold, a water-soluble filament that is best described as, ‘the stuff gel-cap pharmaceuticals are made out of’. Unlike HIPS or PVA, Scaffold is easy to print with, non-toxic and can be dissolved in water. Dissolvable filament is one of the best use cases for dual extrusion, and with E3D’s Scaffold, dual extrusion makes sense now. Of course, dual extrusion traditionally means two extruders and two hotends. If you want quad extrusion, that’s four extruders. This design is ultimately impractical; it’s either too much mass to move around, or there aren’t enough pins on a controller board. Prusa turned these ideas on their head this year with the release of the quad material upgrade for the i3 Mk2. Instead of four different hotends, the Prusa multi-material upgrade only uses one hotend to print in four different colors. The results are spectacular, and it does it using only three extra stepper motors and a simple, cheap breakout board. In 2017, you’re going to see a lot of companies bring a Prusa-style multi-material machine to market. Last year’s review of the state of 3D printing lamented the lack of a mainstream CoreXY printer. This year brought us the D-Bot by [spauda], the first CoreXY printer to be picked up by the community. MakerBot sold the Smart Extruder – a part that should not fail – in packs of three. Makerbot is dead. We knew this last year, but we had to wait for the yearly financials to be released. Makerbot stopped manufacturing their printers in Brooklyn, and now the easy break ovens are manufactured in China. Every other manufacturer of 3D printers is now selling more units than Makerbot. Still, Makerbot released their sixth generation of printers this year, and Makerbot seems to be transitioning to a software company. I have said time and time again that the public perception of 3D printing is tied directly to Makerbot, and no writings on the state of consumer 3D printing mention this basic fact. The graph of the hype cycle matches shares of SYSS. The general public is a few years behind the enthusiast market, so 2018 or 2019 should see a resurgence of 3D printing in the public’s mind. Will Makerbot be around then? Yes, and they might even be making printers a few years from now. 2016 In Embedded ESP32 [Sprite_tm])’s keychain Game BoyIn 2014, a weird chip showed up on Seeed Studio. It was the ESP8266, and while initially this chip was simply a WiFi chip with a UART, hackers got their hands on this tiny little module and turned it into one of the most interesting electronic building blocks in recent memory. 2016 saw the release of the ESP32, the successor to the ESP8266. The first info for the new ESP32 dribbled out around this time last year, and the specs were amazing. The ESP32 is a dual-core WiFi and Bluetooth powerhouse that’s available for peanuts and shows awesome promise. Right now, the ESP32 is fairly rare, but it is available in quantity one. If you want to, you can build the tiniest Game Boy in the World with it. We welcome 2017 and all the ESP32 hacks it will bring. The Raspberry Pi Zero Does Not Exist Cattywampus. The chip layout on the Orange Pi is cattywampus. In November of last year, the Raspberry Pi Zero was released. Idiots on the Internet suggested the Pi Zero didn’t exist operating under the theory that since you can’t buy a Ferrari right now, Ferraris don’t exist either. Disregarding that derailed train of thought, there was a very good reason for the limited production of the Pi Zero. The Pi Foundation was busy manufacturing the Raspberry Pi 3. The Pi 3 was released in February of this year, and is proving to be one of the best single board computers available. It’s fast, has amazing support, and yes, you can just go out and buy one, just like a Raspberry Pi Zero. In other single board computer news, Orange Pi figured out how to rotate parts on a PCB. Intel did something, but not documentation. The DEF CON badge was an x86 chip, and there’s a really, really small x86 system. This year, Microchip acquired Atmel for $3.56 Billion. The PIC vs AVR microcontroller holy war is over. What will become of our ATMegas? At the very least, AVRs will still be around. There’s a new version of “the Arduino”, the ATMega328. It’s the ATMega328PB. There are new ATtinys.  There is, however, a lot of speculation over what will happen to Atmel and the chips we love so dearly. Microchip released a statement. This statement said, basically nothing. That’s good news. “Microchip will continue their philosophy of customer-driven obsolescence,” and Microchip is very good at keeping parts in the catalog long after they have been rendered obsolete. Don’t count on the DIP ‘Tiny85 disappearing anytime soon. Microchip did screw up the Atmel social media today, but at least the chips will be alright. 2016 saw the release of the first Big-O Open microcontrollers. Finally, there’s a glimmer of hope that our silicon will be unencumbered by patents and licenses. Open-V is the first Open Microcontroller, and the HiFive 1 brings the RISC-V core to the Arduino form factor. The RISC-V ISA isn’t a big deal now, but take a look around and see how many ARM microcontrollers are around you. All of those chip manufacturers pay a licensing fee to ARM. RISC-V doesn’t have that. Kids, this is one to put on your resume. 2016 In Hardware Computing Since the dawn of computing, we have all wanted one port. We needed something to attach microphones, hard drives, keyboards, printers, and phones to our computers. It would be nice if this port could supply power. The ability to connect an external device directly to the PCI bus would be neat, and connecting a display through the same cable would be really cool.In 2016, we sort of have it. The USB Type-C port, with Thunderbolt 3, is the closest we’ve ever gotten to this dream. Apple is the standard bearer of new ports. Just look at the original iMac. In an age filled with serial, parallel, and joystick ports, Apple took their ADB cables and turned them into USB ports. The industry quickly adopted USB, and 20 years later, Apple decided to do it again. Apple’s new MacBook Pros are rightly called out for being too expensive, but there is one huge advancement here: the only ports on these machines are Thunderbolt 3 with USB-C. Donglepocolapse is now a word, but it’s not going to last long. My cache of Griffin iMates tell me that. Look forward to fewer ports on your machines in the coming years, thanks to Apple and their support of Thunderbolt 3. Just don’t cheap out on the cables. The Galaxy Note 7 sold like hotcakes in 2016. Wait, I have another one. Samsung was on fire this year with the Galaxy Note 7. This year, Samsung’s flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7 blew up. The problem was with the battery, and a few devices turned into bombs while charging. Samsung recalled the Note 7, and it’s illegal to take this phone on a commercial airline in the US. With this many lithium-powered devices, something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. Despite being outlawed by the FAA and kicked off cellular networks, the Note 7 is still selling for about $200 on eBay. I kind of want one. Microsoft and Apple If 2016 wasn’t weird enough, Apple and Microsoft swapped places. Now the Evil Empire is based out of Cupertino and innovation is coming out of Redmond. Microsoft started this whole mess in March (two days before April Fools) by saying Cygwin Can Suck It. Ubuntu will run with native Windows libraries. In reality, everything is still Windows, but Microsoft is providing a ‘shim’ that will allow Linux binaries to run. Apple Sucks Now, Here’s A Thinkpad Buyer’s Guide. For the past few years, Apple hasn’t been paying attention to the Macintosh. Really: go look at the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide and note the release schedule. Desktops are forgotten, the flagship Mac desktop hasn’t been updated in three years, and the recent update of the MacBook Pro was poorly received. In contrast, Microsoft recently released the Surface Studio PC, a neat piece of hardware that’s even better than an iMac and a Wacom Cintiq. Microsoft will soon require manufacturers to use ‘precision touchpads’ in laptops, giving Windows users an experience similar to the excellent Apple touchpads. The world has turned upside down, and soon we may see bog-standard Windows laptops with the same high-quality hardware found in Apple machines. 2016 wasn’t all bad for Apple. Pressured by the FBI to build a new version of iOS with a backdoor, Apple CEO Tim Cook did something amazing. He said no. The eleventh largest company in the world stood up for civil liberties and user privacy. Around here we swing anti-corporate and anti-establishment, but we have to give Tim Cook the respect he deserves for this action. Of course, a backdoor in iOS wouldn’t have done anything, and the FBI eventually cracked the phone in question, but still, Apple deserves a lot of respect. There’s a lot of real courage over there. Actual Hardware We’ve had desktop CNC mills forever, and the RepRap project is still a noble pursuit. 2016 brought some very cool new machines to market, allowing weekend warriors access to the same tools the big boys have. Wazer is a real waterjet machine that fits on your workbench. For a few thousand dollars, you can cut glass into any shape you want. You can cut metal without heating it. You can cut carbon fiber without wearing out a blade. A waterjet has a lot of requirements — you need high-pressure pumps, nozzles that can withstand abrasion, and a consumable medium. It took several years, but Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter. Although the Shaper isn’t fundamentally different from a ShopBot, this hand-held CNC router is technically the largest CNC router on the planet. Instead of an XY gantry, Shaper uses computer vision and an attentive human operator to keep a bit where it should be. It’s amazing technology that’s been years in the making, but in 2016, this neat piece of kit was finally released. What does 2017 have in store? It’s a bit too early to tell, but desktop injection molding might be a thing next year. Everything will be bigger, better, and cheaper. Looking Forward How does 2017 look like for Hackaday? This year was great for the entire Hackaday family. Editorially, we could have sold out so hard. So hard like you wouldn’t believe. We didn’t. You’re welcome. We’re producing more and better content than we ever have before. Tindie, our ever-faithful robotic dog, is going gangbusters. Every day, more people are selling their electronic and ‘maker’ paraphernalia on Tindie. Hackaday.io is likewise going crazy. Growth is huge, and we continue to have the best hardware community on the Internet. This year was the third Hackaday Prize The entries were amazing, the work was fantastic, and someone even found a use for ferrofluid that wasn’t just artsy-fartsy stuff. We gave away a lot of prizes, and learned a lot from the hundreds of submissions. The SuperConference was a blast, and we already have a theme for next year: “SuperCon IV – Because ‘Zoso’ was already taken”. What does 2017 have in store for Hackaday? More. More of everything. The third edition of the Hackaday Omnibus is in the works, and thanks to our fantastic community managers, we’re doing more events than ever before. 2017 is going to be a great year, and it’s all thanks to you, our readers.

Hot button topics are easy because no one knows how to handle them…including the audience. But boy do they make the servers burn. As for the waterjet and glass, does that introduce any stress in the cut edges that needs to be treated out? And the Note 7 maybe a third supplier can fix the “too big for the space” battery assuming that was the problem. Report comment Reply SOI Sentinel says: December 30, 2016 at 7:56 am The waterjet will not add any additional stresses. This doesn’t mean that already existing stresses won’t make trouble, though. I have a friend who had a Note 7. I think he would have gone for a slightly smaller battery as long as the pen related software stayed the same (which as far as I know means you’re still using the stock ROM image). He wouldn’t have liked that, but if an external battery-case would have offset it, I think he would have lived with it. I’ve not messed with my Android phones, so I don’t know how easy it would have been to disable the auto updates that are disabling Note 7’s currently. It STILL would have not been allowed on a plane (or other public transportation?), however, which would continue to reduce its audience. Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:19 pm “Wazer finally released their machine with a successful Kickstarter.” Umm, might want to reword that to read: Wazer finished a Kickstarter campaign. That doesn’t mean they have or are going to actually release a machine or that the machine is actually going to be any good. It’s a niche machine in a niche market with major drawbacks and it still is very much a manual machine in terms of the amount of work you have to do to operate it, clean it, etc. Plus, waste disposal and just buying the raw abrasive materials are not easy at all either. It’s basically a “no frills” machine that can produce about as much (still undisclosed) pressure as a pressure washer that happens to be able to erode materials but does so at a much slower pace than anything commercially available, while using significantly more abrasive per minute. There remain a significant amount of unanswered questions about the machine and until those are answered, I am still reserving judgement on exactly what this machine can actually do. It’s a neat toy for sure and it has a very small user base that would appreciate what it can do but I am reserving overall judgement until they actually, you know, release something (machines, actual specifications) to customers.

It’s still not a 3d printer though. “If your Glowforge was pre-ordered before October 25th, 2015, it will be ready to ship July 2017” “If you choose to receive a pre-release unit, it will remain our property.

Mostly the newer graphics technologies are not only relevant to the game development field but more specifically the game engine development. It reveals the complex workings that used to be driver domain and leaves it up the programmer to do all the code leading to a lot of bloat where unless your making a engine you probably aren’t going to use it. Hackaday seems to focused on hardware and hardware hacks. Vulkan and DirectX seem a bit out of scope.

Report comment Reply Internet says: December 31, 2016 at 12:34 pm As much as I would like it to be, I remain a bit reserved that desktop injection molding is going to be a huge game changer in 2017 unless I am missing something about the mold production process being made cheaper and easier? I could see it happen by combining a few automated 3d design tools with JIT aluminum milling, bringing the costs of the mold down to maybe a few grand, tops without requiring huge amounts of mold design work, combining that with a $10,000ish machine with a high degree of automation that can use off the shelf nurdles. Who handles mold post finishing and polishing work? You are not going to get a high polish finish without somebody or something rubbing the heck out of the mold first. But they are quoting a mold cost of $250. “Mold cost by using CNC machine your own $250 (Tormach).” That feels a bit… optimistic. And a Tormach, while a decent machine, is not cheap nor automated. The $250 quoted “mold cost” would be for mostly the cost of the material and maybe wear on the tooling but nothing else. Report comment Reply The Snob says: January 2, 2017 at 10:04 am Protomold can pretty much do what you’re referring to–upload a CAD file and quote you a cost to produce X units in Y material. As you say, you see right away that much of the cost of a tool is how nice a finish you want. As-machined tools are pretty cheap. As for the cost of making a tool on a Tormach, a couple nice chunks of 6061 bar is maybe $30, so unless you’re snapping endmills regularly, most of the cost is going to be labor. If you’re making your own prototypes, then I suppose it depends on how you value your time and whether you’re amortizing the ~15k cost of the mill and tooling. I’m also a little curious about the volume:clamp pressure ratio. I have a Morgan G55T which has a 2oz shot size which is a little bigger than this, but the max clamp pressure is 20 tons versus about 6.5 on this one, and it has more than twice the injection pressure. So I wonder about the limitations there. That said, the controls and automation on this machine look very nice. I’m a bit skeptical of the price given that a new Morgan is ~20k for a much simpler machine whose R&D costs were paid off decades ago, but I guess Chinese controls and mechanicals are pretty cheap nowadays… Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Wearable makers want you to want them USA TODAY 3 days ago Mike Feibus © USA TODAY Still image of wearables Most of you still don’t have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, recent surveys reveal nor do you want one. Worse, many of you who received them as gifts got bored and gave up on them. Which means it’s time for smartwatches and fitness trackers to take the next step. Stagnant growth is now adding urgency to the message that counting steps has taken wearables about as far as they can go. So as consumer electronics suppliers prepare to jet off next week to Consumer Electronics Show, the industry’s annual gathering in Las Vegas, wearables companies like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit and Samsung find themselves confronting the uncomfortable truth that their products still aren’t compelling to normal people. I expect 2017 will be a make-or-break year for wearables makers as they retool to extend their market beyond techno-geeks, professional athletes, fitness freaks and other early adopters. We’ll start seeing changes beginning next week at CES, with more accurate hardware, more interesting metrics and more helpful insight. Can they succeed?  Too early to say. I’m seeing positive developments in hardware and metrics, and I expect a lot of those building blocks to fall into place in 2017. But I worry about whether they are paying enough attention to the last, most vital component: engaging insight. It’s difficult — and, frankly, foreign — for wearables makers to venture beyond technology and into psychology. But it’s critically important to the future of this $10 billion business. If they can’t come up with creative ways to keep normal people interested, then next year’s wearables are destined for the sock drawer, along with millions of other trackers from Christmas Past. Better hardware, more meaningful metrics The wrist may be one of the easiest spots on the body to strap a wearable. But it’s also one of the toughest places to collect measurements, because there is so much extraneous activity. Take step-counting, for example. When we walk, our arms typically sway back and forth. But we might also grab something from our pocket. Or scratch our heads. Or wave to friends. Weeding out those confounding movements is no small task. Heart rate is also difficult to measure on the wrist because of all the movement. Most wearables shine light into the skin and use sensors to detect changes caused by blood flow. Pretty straightforward, provided we’re sitting perfectly still. Which we almost never are. Movement can cause wearables to shift a little on the skin, and change how much ambient light seeps in. Companies like Analog Devices, Intel, Philips, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Valencell have made great strides in filtering out all the noise to deliver more accurate results. That, in turn, is giving rise to new metrics that go well beyond simple step counts and heart rate. Like heart-rate variability, or HRV, for example. HRV tracks the time between individual heart beats. Though your heart may pump at a steady rate of 72 beats per minute, the time between each of those 72 beats are all a little different. The variations are typically larger when you’re calm and relaxed, and shorter when you’re active or tense. HRV is proving to be a critical indicator of stress, fitness and overall health. Which is why companies like Firstbeat, LifeQ and NeuroSky are offering heart-rate variability along with a wealth of other new measures, including stress levels, calorie intake, sleep quality and even blood pressure. Getting people to care So how do they make wearables useful to normal people? Even with so many new metrics, this may be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Like most tech industry players, wearables suppliers are so focused on delivering the next capabilities, improving the display and extending battery life that they sometimes lose sight of what will make people put on their devices – and keep them on. I certainly don’t qualify as one of the normal people they’re trying to reach. I’m one of those early adopter types. I’ve already logged more than 10 million steps tracked by nearly 20 different wearables. Being an early adopter means I’m willing to do what most normal people won’t: put up with the time and aggravation of force-fitting new technology into my life for limited and sometimes questionable gain. I do it to get an early glimpse into what’s possible. Normal people won’t tolerate that. They are interested in wearables that can nudge them onto a healthier path. But they must be quick and easy to set up, gain insight as they learn about you, and offer up recommendations for fine-tuning our activity at a time when we’re interested in hearing them.

As per sources, an unidentified source claiming to be ‘Dark Hacker’ identified itself as ‘Distrucktor Dipu’ had maliciously seeped into the hospital website rendering it useless. It had deleted the entire database on the website. It had reportedly posted some lewd comments and abusive statements while uploading a Bangladesh flag also. Meanwhile, the hospital authorities have blocked the website and filed a complaint at the local cyber police station. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics, popularly known as Sishubhawan hospital is a renowned institute for child care in eastern India. Recently Odisha has witnessed sharp increase in hacking and other cyber related crimes. From governmental to private, hackers have been able to manipulate weak database of the websites and destroy crucial information while putting Intel at risk as cyber police is yet to take any noticeable action in this regard. On April 20 OSSC website was hacked by Philippines Cyber syndicate, Utkal University’s website was similarly hacked on May 3 by a Pakistan branded source. Earlier on September 30, the website of Odisha State Agricultural Marketing (OSAM) Board was hacked by pro-Pakistan hackers.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search The “Dogs Of The Dow” Strategy Worked Incredibly Well In 2016 December 30, 2016 7:05am INDEXDJX:.DJI NYSE:DIA ShareTweet From Mike Burnick: It has been a volatile, difficult year for most stock market investors, as you can see in the chart of the Dow shown below. But one time-honored investment strategy absolutely smoked the indexes in 2016, the venerable Dow Dogs. 2016 began with an 11% Dow dive in January, then after see-saw price action in February, stocks bungee-jumped right back, with a 16% rally into spring. But alas, from mid-April through October, investors were greeted with more frustrating see-saw action as the Dow settled into an uneven trading range. If you look to the far right hand side of the chart above, you can see that really ALL of the gains for the Dow this year came in the final two months, with the Dow up just over 14% year to date. The basic strategy of simply buying the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average – known as the Dogs of the Dow – beat the Dow, and most other stock market indexes, by a wide margin in 2016. An equally weighted portfolio of the Dow Dogs, constructed on December 31, 2015, gained nearly 21% this year, compared to a gain of just 14.4% for all 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a gain of just 10.7% for the S&P 500 Index. What’s more, you would have started 2016 already ahead of the game, with a hefty average dividend yield of 3.85% from the 10 Dow dogs – nearly twice the yield of the overall stock market! And last year’s performance isn’t just an aberration either. The Dow Dogs have beaten the Dow Jones Industrials in five out of the last six years, including 2016. Over the past five years alone, the Dogs’ average annual gain is 14.9%, compared to just 11.7% for the Dow itself, a sizeable performance advantage for these stock market mutts. So to see which high dividend yielding Dow stocks make it into the dog pound for 2017, see the table below… There are quite a few returning mutts for the year ahead, and two new dogs entering the list. The top five performing Dogs of 2016 (Caterpillar, Chevron, IBM, Verizon and Exxon Mobil) remain on the list for next year too, which is quite an accomplishment. Typically, superior price performance reduces the dividend yield and lets last year’s dogs graduate from the pound. Caterpillar (CAT), for instance, gained 44.6% in 2016, topping all the other dogs (and the other 29 Dow stocks too), but its dividend yield of 4.1% is still the second-highest among the Dow 30 stocks. Also, returning for 2017 are Cisco Systems (CSCO), Pfizer (PFE) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Two new dogs join them for 2017: Intel (INTC) and Coca-Cola (KO), which replace Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK) in the dog pound next year. Bottom line: While relatively few stock investment strategies stand the test of time, the Dogs of the Dow has a very good track record at beating the market. Plus, there aren’t many strategies as easy for you to execute as buying and holding ten blue-chip stocks that pay attractive dividends while waiting for price appreciation. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was unchanged in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, DIA has gained 15.73%, versus a 11.19% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. DIA currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #3 of 76 ETFs in the Large Cap Value ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Money And Markets.

A Bay Area resident herself, Kohli has completed 200+ hours of community service during her high school years, volunteering for several organizations that aid the homeless, such as West Valley Community Services and Family Supportive Housing. She even received the Presidential Volunteer Service Silver Award to commemorate her efforts in 2016. Her work compelled her to research homelessness in the Bay Area, using interviews with homeless people and nonprofit workers to explore the pervasive issue. The project highlighted the funding needs of agencies aiding the homeless, motivating Kohli to do her part in combating the issue. By contributing all of the proceeds from her debut art showcase, Kohli was able to raise $1000+ for West Valley Community Services, an organization providing resources to the homeless in Santa Clara County. Regarding her efforts, the budding artist and activist said, “I hope my journey, shaped by the many homeless people I have met, will make people realize that they need to help the homeless and that they have the power to change someone’s life.” Kohli’s extensive work with the homeless community left an itching desire to understand how such poverty could exist, even in one of America’s richest neighborhoods. As she compiled her own research project, she discovered the high-housing costs and lack of awareness regarding homelessness were the main culprits. Kohli wants to combat all the problems she can, using the art fundraiser for the homeless of Santa Clara County to combat the issue of agencies lacking funds. Last month at the Winter Art & Craft Fair, organized for their employees by American technology company Intel, in Santa Clara, Pankhuri Kohli participated along with her mother and artist Sujata Tibrewala to exhibit some of her paintings. Encouraged by the stupendous response her paintings got, Kohli decided to continue her efforts to raise funds through online showcase of their works. The artists were able to meet their target of raising $1000, all of which assists the homeless in the Santa Clara county. About the event: Artist Pankhuri Kohli along with her mother Sujata Tibrewala raised funds through the sale of their art, art prints and bookmarks with their art on it by participating in the annual Winter Art Fair organized by Tibrewala’s employers Intel in Santa Clara. The artists continued their exhibit online and successfully reached their target of $1000 to raise funds for West Valley Community Services, Inc. (WVCS), a private non-profit, community-based agency that has been providing direct assistance and referral services to the west valley communities of Santa Clara County for over 40 years. About Pankhuri Kohli: Pankhuri Kohli is a high school senior student and an emerging artist who pursues art as a hobby and to help make a difference to the lives of others. She aspires to raise awareness towards the problem of homelessness and has just completed an extensive research on the subject.

Mr. Obama plans to rent an office in Washington, as history repeats itself, sort of. It was Woodrow Wilson who became the last president to remain in Washington after his term was up. Americans were not sold on Wilson's advocacy of U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Moreover, our World War I president's long illness had unofficially made his First Lady the de facto President during the last two years of her husband's term. But Obama In our day – since the Constitution barred Mr. Obama from a third term on top of his ruinous and lawless eight years – our current president used as an excuse to hang around Washington the fact that one of his daughters wanted to finish her schooling. Yeah, right. His real aim is clear. The mainstream media will treat him as the fountainhead of all wisdom, as of course he knew they would, and he will now be in a perfect position to second guess (by then) President Trump, who can't get to that White House soon enough to rescue America. Constitution? Since Mr. Obama disregarded the Constitution while in office, what makes anyone think he will respect that precious freedom-preserving, tyrant-unfriendly document now that he is safely beyond the wrath of the mere voters? Many of them are steaming because of the uncountable illegal aliens who may have given Hillary Clinton her edge in the popular vote, as he openly urged them to do. This situation is precisely the ultimate example of why the Founding Fathers gave us the Electoral College. We don't know whether illegals tipped the scales to enable Hillary to carry the heavy vote count in California and New York. UN Supposedly "on his way out the door," Mr.Obama has stabbed Israel, our reliable ally in the Middle East, by making it even easier for the terrorists there to inflict permanent damage on that lone democracy in the neighborhood. Even though the settlements have been built, for which Israel is roundly criticized, what really does it matter? Many of those objecting the loudest do not believe Israel has a right to exist. So what are we talking about here? Stop hitting my fist with your face (again)? Hypocrisy But don't worry. On January, the betrayal of an ally will mean even less to our outgoing president who imitates a whiny autocrat when he's not only beyond the voters, but also beyond the reach of impeachment. Somewhere, there is a need to make an official "on the record" statement about him. Dereliction of duty? Failure to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"? Even worse? Does anyone dare utter the "t" word (as in traitor)? What's more... Our friends at Judicial Watch have issued a report that "Islamic terrorists operate [and] raise cash in Latin America to attack [the] U.S." Chris Farrell's report from Judicial Watch is based on a document released by Spain's Defense Ministry, which informs us that Latin America "is a hotbed of terrorism where groups like ISIS and Hezbollah operate freely and raise large sums of money to finance terrorism in other countries, mainly the United States." Judicial Watch cites cooperation between Islamic terrorists and Mexican drug cartels, and the Spanish Intel report says, "The ignorance involving the threat of jihadist terrorism in Latin America has been such that some governments have refused to cooperate with U.S. authorities." Millions of Muslims, including some from nations that are rife with terrorist activity, have flooded nations south of the U.S. border. This column has previously reported that we in the U.S. are surrounded – literally, politically, militarily, and ideologically. This peril to our nation comes at a time when our lame duck Commander-in-Chief is giddy exhibiting the swagger that has sometimes characterized bullies. He betrays not only the people who twice elected him, but, as with his betrayal of Israel, has no compunction about abandoning allies. It requires no genius to be concerned that all this threat and danger can lead to war on our own soil. 9/11 may have been a prelude. Again we are reminded of the tongue-lashing delivered bluntly on the floor of the British Parliament to the hapless Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who had appeased Hitler – "In the name of God, go." But Chamberlain was a dupe. Obama shows every sign of knowing exactly what he is doing. © Wes Vernon   The views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.

Wearable makers want you to want them USA TODAY 3 days ago Mike Feibus © USA TODAY Still image of wearables Most of you still don’t have a smartwatch or fitness tracker, recent surveys reveal nor do you want one. Worse, many of you who received them as gifts got bored and gave up on them. Which means it’s time for smartwatches and fitness trackers to take the next step. Stagnant growth is now adding urgency to the message that counting steps has taken wearables about as far as they can go. So as consumer electronics suppliers prepare to jet off next week to Consumer Electronics Show, the industry’s annual gathering in Las Vegas, wearables companies like Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Misfit and Samsung find themselves confronting the uncomfortable truth that their products still aren’t compelling to normal people. I expect 2017 will be a make-or-break year for wearables makers as they retool to extend their market beyond techno-geeks, professional athletes, fitness freaks and other early adopters. We’ll start seeing changes beginning next week at CES, with more accurate hardware, more interesting metrics and more helpful insight. Can they succeed?  Too early to say. I’m seeing positive developments in hardware and metrics, and I expect a lot of those building blocks to fall into place in 2017. But I worry about whether they are paying enough attention to the last, most vital component: engaging insight. It’s difficult — and, frankly, foreign — for wearables makers to venture beyond technology and into psychology. But it’s critically important to the future of this $10 billion business. If they can’t come up with creative ways to keep normal people interested, then next year’s wearables are destined for the sock drawer, along with millions of other trackers from Christmas Past. Better hardware, more meaningful metrics The wrist may be one of the easiest spots on the body to strap a wearable. But it’s also one of the toughest places to collect measurements, because there is so much extraneous activity. Take step-counting, for example. When we walk, our arms typically sway back and forth. But we might also grab something from our pocket. Or scratch our heads. Or wave to friends. Weeding out those confounding movements is no small task. Heart rate is also difficult to measure on the wrist because of all the movement. Most wearables shine light into the skin and use sensors to detect changes caused by blood flow. Pretty straightforward, provided we’re sitting perfectly still. Which we almost never are. Movement can cause wearables to shift a little on the skin, and change how much ambient light seeps in. Companies like Analog Devices, Intel, Philips, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Valencell have made great strides in filtering out all the noise to deliver more accurate results. That, in turn, is giving rise to new metrics that go well beyond simple step counts and heart rate. Like heart-rate variability, or HRV, for example. HRV tracks the time between individual heart beats. Though your heart may pump at a steady rate of 72 beats per minute, the time between each of those 72 beats are all a little different. The variations are typically larger when you’re calm and relaxed, and shorter when you’re active or tense. HRV is proving to be a critical indicator of stress, fitness and overall health. Which is why companies like Firstbeat, LifeQ and NeuroSky are offering heart-rate variability along with a wealth of other new measures, including stress levels, calorie intake, sleep quality and even blood pressure. Getting people to care So how do they make wearables useful to normal people? Even with so many new metrics, this may be the most difficult hurdle to overcome. Like most tech industry players, wearables suppliers are so focused on delivering the next capabilities, improving the display and extending battery life that they sometimes lose sight of what will make people put on their devices – and keep them on. I certainly don’t qualify as one of the normal people they’re trying to reach. I’m one of those early adopter types. I’ve already logged more than 10 million steps tracked by nearly 20 different wearables. Being an early adopter means I’m willing to do what most normal people won’t: put up with the time and aggravation of force-fitting new technology into my life for limited and sometimes questionable gain. I do it to get an early glimpse into what’s possible. Normal people won’t tolerate that. They are interested in wearables that can nudge them onto a healthier path. But they must be quick and easy to set up, gain insight as they learn about you, and offer up recommendations for fine-tuning our activity at a time when we’re interested in hearing them.

The G5 successor is also believed to debut sans the modular design its predecessor introduced to the market this year.  LG is putting its past behind it. While its G4 handset debuted with a plastic body, the G5 launched with an all-metal design. As the South Korea brand moves on with its next flagship, it intends to use a different material for its body. Information from insiders based in its home country claims the upcoming G6 flagship device is sporting a curved all-glass back and an all-glass front.  Android Authority has learned that for the front of the handset, LG is going to use a 2.5D glass panel that’s being manufactured by Biel Company. The front glass won’t be curved like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, but it will resemble the panel found on the regular Galaxy S7.  Related Stories Ransomware Ruins Holiday By Hijacking Family's LG Smart TV on Christmas Day LG G6 Won't Come With G5's Modular Design LG to Supply Apple, Google and Microsoft with Foldable Displays At the back is a different story. Apparently, LG is reportedly making a handset that will come equipped with a 3D glass panel. It will have curved sides for better grip. This panel is rumored to be manufactured by C&S Glass. For many consumers, ditching the all-metal body found on its predecessor is quite puzzling. However, sources say that LG has decided to ditch metal for glass because it intends to add a seamless wireless charging feature to the G6. This just corroborates previous intel that LG is giving up on its modular design.  Using glass for the G6 is all the more not surprising knowing that Samsung and Apple are also preparing glass smartphones for 2017. It remains to be seen if other brands are following suit. Nonetheless, it’s clear that industry giants are going for edgier technologies with their upcoming releases next year.  The new information comes a day after renders of the LG G6 leaked online. Based on the renders, the handset could sport a 5.3-inch QHD display with 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. The device is also rumored to come with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset, as per MobileSyrup. Since nothing has been set in stone so far, the specs and features of the G6 could be different when it is revealed at CES 2017.

The curved monitor Samsung CH711 will be officially launched at CES 2017 with the details on price and availability. While Samsung says the monitor is designed keeping gamers in mind, a look at the monitor would also make it seem at home in a professional setup and even Mac users. The Samsung CH711 quantum dot curved monitor would be selling in the 27-inch and 31.5-inch form factor with a QHD or 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. The monitor features an 1800R radius curvature and will be offering a viewing angle of around 178-degrees with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It claims to offer 125 percent of sRGB coverage as well. The monitors are expected to start selling in early 2017. (Also Read: CES 2017: Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, Xiaomi and other company keynotes you need to keep a track of) The Samsung CH711 can be adjusted vertically as well as horizontally and can also support a three-sided ‘Boundless’ design. This means that you can place three CH711s beside each other in case you want a really wide display. This is helped by the fact that the CH711 has extremely thin bezels on the sides as well as the top. Quantum Dots do not suffer from lag issues as say an OLED panel does, which makes it ideal for gamers. But having said that, the picture quality and contrast offered by an OLED display is currently claimed to be superior to quantum dot monitors. Samsung hasn’t clarified if the panel will be an 8-bit one or a 10-bit one. Also no details are out on the refresh rate either. Samsung will let us know more details in its CES 2017 keynote address. It will also be announcing availability and pricing details of CFG70 and CF791 Quantum dot monitors at CES.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) Click here for image slideshow Among deaths in 2016, a heavy toll in pop music William McDonald / New York Times News Service Published Dec 31, 2016 at 01:16PM Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn’t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports, and the back-to-back daughter-mother Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist — was as shape-shifting as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured his death would appear out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his — I hesitate to say merry — way, ever the wise, gravel-voiced troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song.” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another pop-star death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people still can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane; Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the locked-up outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’ swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose recording-studio genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking self-regard and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of middle-class postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome — but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88; and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake — his the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant — can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat cancer, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras: Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and NBA champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86, and his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the paint in a 14-year Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the whites-only major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more vitally and urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where old Hollywood glamour and well-heeled West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a long-ago burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling homefront. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in U.S. politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Texas, to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a cigar-smoking strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are truth-seekers, even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, pre-eminently, Edward Albee — all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun make-believe for our viewing pleasure — none more lustily than Fisher, the nothing-dainty-about-her Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a kind of hilariously neurotic comedy well suited for a therapy-obsessed culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his convention-defying meditations on life and art; Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives; Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”), Alan Young (“Mister Ed”), Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”), William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”), Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”), Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork & Mindy,” “Laverne & Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. Street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck — what a picture! — had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art by recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and new music soprano Phyllis Curtin; jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri; rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor); and Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a culture-changing executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ‘80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a conscience-stricken gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives. 16045121 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Concrete specifications are slim, but the forthcoming iteration could potentially sport a 4K display, and be bundled with a magnetic charging Surface Pen.  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement At Microsoft's Surface-focused event late October, there wasn't any word on a Surface Pro refresh. However, the Surface Pro 4's successor might be unveiled in the next few months, with the next Surface Pro iteration expected to feature a 4K display and a magnetic charging stylus. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumors Microsoft is currently working on a new Surface Pro tablet, according to a new report, touting a Q1 2017 release for the tablet in question. The report, which comes from the Economic Daily News in China and was spotted by Digitimes, adds that Pegatron Technology will be the one to manufacture the device. Microsoft has also considered Quanta Computer as a possible manufacturer for the Surface Pro 5, but the company has yet to confirm its plans. In October, Microsoft unveiled a new version of its two-in-one Surface Book hybrid, and a new all-in-one desktop computer called the Surface Studio. The event was strategically scheduled ahead of Apple's event the following day, and many pundits have opined that Microsoft's show was far more compelling than Apple's. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4, released in 2015, is Microsoft's latest Surface Pro iteration, and while there had been healthy speculation about a successor being teased during company's event in October, nary a hint of a new refreshed Surface Pro 4 was given by Microsoft, causing many to wonder about the future of Microsoft's high-end tablet lineup. The Chinese report is thin on other rumors apart from possible manufacturing partners, though it states that the Surface Pro 5 will sport an Ultra HD resolution, as previously mentioned. The stylus, named the Surface Pen, will also be released alongside the Surface Pro 5, and it will utilize magnetic charging, the first time a Surface Pro tablet would be able to do so, if the report is correct. A specific release date is unavailable as of this time, and Microsoft could still change its plans for the forthcoming Surface Pro 5 as it progresses through the manufacturing process. The Surface Pro 4 is billed by Microsoft as "the tablet that can replace your laptop," compact enough to be lugged anywhere, and powerful enough to be used as a full desktop workstation. It rocks a 12.3-inch PixelSense multi-touch display with a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824, at 267 dpi. Under the hood can either be a sixth-generation Intel core m3, i5, or i7 processor, up to 16 GB of RAM, partnered with an Intel HD graphics 515 for the Core m3 variant, Intel HD graphics 520 for the i5 variant, and an Intel Iris graphics for the i7 variant. There are also a number of SSD storage configurations for the tablet, with 1 TB being the maximum. What features would you like to see in the Surface Pro 5?

Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the back-to-back daughter-mother Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist — was as shape-shifting as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his — I hesitate to say merry — way, ever the wise, gravel-voiced troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song.” Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another pop-star death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane; Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the locked-up outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose recording-studio genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking self-regard and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of middle-class postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome — but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88; and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake — his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant — can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer’s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N.B.A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86; his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a 14-year Hall of Fame career, was 74.

When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the whites-only major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country.

Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where old-Hollywood glamour and well-heeled West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a long-ago burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex., to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a cigar-smoking strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are truth-seekers, even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, pre-eminently, Edward Albee — all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun make-believe for our viewing pleasure — none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the nothing-dainty-about-her Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a therapy-obsessed culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his convention-defying meditations on life and art; Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives; Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”), Alan Young (“Mister Ed”), Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”), William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”), Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”), Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork & Mindy,” “Laverne & Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck — what a picture! — had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin; the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri; the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor); and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a culture-changing executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ’80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a conscience-stricken gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. Advertisement Continue reading the main story By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.

Patent suggests the firm could be working on eye tracking technology Microsoft has filed a patent for eye-tracking in a head-mounted display The technology uses infrared beams to track your eyes This reduces the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view It is unclear if or when Microsoft will begin to use the technology  By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 06:58 EST, 30 December 2016 | Updated: 07:10 EST, 30 December 2016 e-mail 7 shares 1 View comments The ability to browse a website without needing to as much as move your hand could soon be a possibility with Microsoft's next HoloLens device. Microsoft has filed a patent for new eye-tracking technology for head-mounted displays (HMDs). The technology uses infrared beams to track the eyes, reducing the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view as seen in current devices on the market. Scroll down for video  Microsoft has filed a patent for new eye-tracking technology for head-mounted displays (HMDs). The technology uses infrared beams to track the eyes, reducing the need for clunky cameras that obstruct your view as seen in current devices on the market HOW WILL IT WORK?  The glasses will use 'wave guides' to track infrared-lit eyes.  The patent states: 'A waveguide, which can be used in a head mounted display (HMD), but is not limited for use therewith, is transparent and includes an input-coupler and an output-coupler. 'The input-coupler comprises a grating area, formed by plurality of curved grating lines, that diffract light beams incident on the input-coupler into the waveguide and towards a common region at which is located the output-coupler. 'The curved grating lines of the input-coupler have a radially varying pitch.' The patent goes on to describe how the infrared beams work with the curved grating lines of the input coupler to produce an eye-tracking effect. The patent was uncovered by MSPoweruser, and includes a complex diagram showing how the new technology will work. 'Wave guides' will be used to track infrared-lit eyes, in an attempt to prevent your line of sight from being obstructed. Currently, most eye-tracking devices rely on a clunky camera attached to the frame of the display, meaning that at least part of your view is hindered. Alternatively, the only other eye-tracking technology available uses a reflector to bend the camera's line of sight towards your temple. But this is a problems for people who wear glasses, which can get in the way. If Microsoft's new patent is to be believed, it would remedy this problem, using a transparent wave guide to track the eyes using infrared. The patent states: 'A waveguide, which can be used in a head mounted display (HMD), but is not limited for use therewith, is transparent and includes an input-coupler and an output-coupler.

It is unclear if or when Microsoft will begin using the technology in its HoloLens devices.  HOLOLENS FEATURES  The HoloLens development edition includes the headset, a clicker for interacting with applications, a carrying case, nose pads and overheads straps. The headset is designed with multiple environment understanding sensors and powered by a custom-built Microsoft Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) and an Intel 32-bit chipset. The device weighs just a little over one pound and consists of 64GB of Flash memory and 2GB of RAM. The battery lasts for about two to three hours, with up to two weeks of standby time, says Microsoft. HoloLens has a 'see-through holographic lens' that uses an optical projection system to create multi-dimensional full-colour 'holograms'. According to Microsoft, 'the key to a great holographic experience is holograms that are light point rich, they have a high holographic density and are pinned, or anchored, to the world around you. In order to achieve this, the device has an optimal holographic density of 2.5k radiants.   Read more: About - MSPoweruser Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!
