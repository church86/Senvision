At the time there was a strong assumption that this would be mobile focused – perhaps in the form of a cellular modem or an ARM core – and it turns out the assumptions were both right and wrong. Today AMD is announcing that they are in fact going to start integrating ARM cores into future APUs starting in 2013, but not in the way you’re probably thinking. If you look at AMD’s long term strategy, not only do they need to continue to compete with Intel on the technology front, but they also want to better position themselves to compete on the tablet front. AMD has the basic hardware for this with their APU families, particularly for tablets with their Zacate based entry-level APUs, but they have a feature gap in certain markets. Both Intel and ARM have hardware trusted platform/security technologies but AMD lacks such a technology. For various reasons we’ll get to in a moment, AMD believes they need some kind of hardware security platform technology to continue to compete in the market in the future. Intel’s Trusted Execution Technology is not part of the x86 specification and is therefore not shared, so AMD would need to come up with their own technology. Designing and implementing such a technology is not only resource intensive but by its very nature it fragments the market, which is something AMD doesn’t necessarily have the clout to get away with all the time. So rather than design their own technology they’ve chosen to license an existing technology, and this brings us to ARM. In order to implement a hardware security platform on their future APUs, AMD has chosen to enter into a strategic partnership with ARM for the purpose of gaining access to ARM’s TrustZone technology. By licensing TrustZone, AMD gains a hardware security platform that’s already in active use, which means they avoid fragmenting the market and the risks that would bring. Furthermore AMD saves on the years of work – both technical and evangelical – that they would have needed had they rolled their own solution. Or more simply put, given their new willingness to integrate 3rd party IP, licensing was the easy solution to getting a hardware security platform quickly. But because TrustZone is an ARM technology (both in name and ISA) AMD needs an ARM CPU to execute it. So the key to all of this will be the integration of an ARM processor into an AMD APU, specifically ARM’s Cortex-A5 CPU. The Cortex-A5 is ARM’s simplest ARMv7 application processor, and while it’s primarily designed for entry-level and other lower-performance devices, as it turns out it fits AMD’s needs quite nicely since it won’t be used as a primary application processor. ARM TrustZone Hardware Model; Normal World Would Be On x86 This also means that the ARM and x86 CPU cores will fit together in an interesting manner unlike any existing ARM or Intel x86 CPU. By integrating a low-power/low-performance ARM CPU in this manner an application will be split up over multiple CPUs, with the TrustZone secure backend executing on the Cortex-A5 while the frontend logic will be executing as normal on AMD’s x86 CPU and GPU cores. This gives AMD a dedicated security co-processor with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof, while on full ARM processors and on Intel’s x86 processors TrustZone and TXT respectively are hardware features of a single CPU. By implementing a hardware security platform in this manner AMD not only gains a relatively quick turnaround time on the hardware, but on the software side too. AMD is specifically looking to leverage existing ARM applications for their tablet ambitions by taking advantage of the fact that existing TrustZone application cores can easily (if not directly) be ported over to AMD’s APUs. Developers would still need to put in some effort to write the necessary x86 frontends (in all likelihood written in scratch for Win8 as opposed to any kind of Android), but the hard part of implementing and validating the TrustZone functionality would simply carry over, leaving the new x86 frontend to talk to the existing ARM TrustZone application core. AMD isn’t in any position to talk about specific software yet, but we’re told that they’ve been working with select software partners even before this announcement in order to get a jump on developing applications. As for the hardware details AMD hasn’t named any specific APUs that will be receiving the Cortex-A5, but they have told us that they intend to start with the low-power APUs in order to go after the tablet market. That means we’re almost certainly looking at the 2013 successor to the Zacate APU found at the heart of AMD’s Brazos platform. However AMD won’t be stopping there, and in 2014 and beyond AMD will continue to add it to further APUs until AMD’s entire APU lineup from mobile to desktop to server contains the Cortex-A5 and TrustZone functionality. Having covered the technology, let’s also quickly discuss why AMD is pursuing this move. As AMD is pitching this it’s not just closing a feature gap but also about what it enables. A big focus of this of course is on trusted computing in the classical sense, meaning DRM for consumer applications and on platform lockdown and auditing for business IT purposes. But as we’ve seen Intel do with their acquisition of McAfee some years back, there’s also a strong focus on securing systems from malware in the form of new anti-virus technologies and in newer applications such as mobile payments. Even cloud services get a mention in here, since TrustZone can be used to make sure malware isn’t watching in on a session from the client. It’s worth noting that AMD also has a bit of self-interest in here. AMD’s Chief Information Officer Mike Wolfe is spearheading this announcement with a focus on how AMD intends to use this technology internally. AMD recently implemented a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy for employees to let them use their own computers at work. BYOD is popular with employees because it allows them to use the device they like the most, but it’s a potential headache for IT since it means many different devices that need to be supported and secured. As a result only a select number of generally high-end devices are allowed in AMD’s BYOD environment because most low-end x86 devices lack hardware security platform technology. By implementing this in their entire range of APUs, AMD expects to be self-serving here by expanding the range of devices they can support. At the same time AMD and Wolfe expect other companies to adopt BYOD too, in which case this will help to quickly set up AMD to serve a potentially large market. Wrapping things up, we would be remiss to ignore the elephant in the room, which of course is the inclusion of an ARM core in the first place. A lot of speculation has been going on that AMD is considering adopting the ARM architecture on a broader basis – particularly if HSA takes off and makes the underlying architecture less important – and this certainly is going to fuel more of that. The Cortex-A5 in AMD’s future APUs will be a fully functional ARM processor and in theory it is possible to run full ARM applications on the processor (OS differences not withstanding), though at this point in time AMD hasn’t released the full details on how accessing the ARM processor will work. Even if AMD just intends to use ARM for TrustZone today, this opens the door to comprehensive native ARM code execution in the future if AMD wanted to go that way; but at the same time this could end up being as far as AMD ever goes. In any case we aren’t expecting AMD to go into any more detail about this announcement here at AFDS, but there are still two days of keynotes to go. Otherwise we’d expect AMD to discuss this in greater detail once they’re ready to unveil more details about their 2013 APUs. So until then stay tuned.

POST A COMMENT 36 Comments View All Comments Ben90 - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Pardon my noobness, but I just don't understand the concepts of why this is necessary. Reply Yuriman - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Taken from arm.com: "TrustZone technology, tightly integrated tightly into Cortex™-A processors, extends throughout the system via the AMBA® AXI™ bus and specific TrustZone System IP blocks. This system approach means that it is possible to secure peripherals such as secure memory, crypto blocks, keyboard and screen to ensure they can be protected from software attack." In part, AMD is embarrassed that their employees can only bring Intel processors onto their secure work network due to lack of hardware security on AMD's own chips. Hardware level security is the future. Reply ExarKun333 - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link LOL, yeah they should be a little embarrassed that their own workers cannot bring AMD CPUs into work. :) Reply JKflipflop98 - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link That's funny because Intel still uses Pentium 4's and 1st gen Core 2's internally. Reply Beleaguered - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Which site and business group runs Pentium 4 laptops? I don't think I've run across anyone at Intel that runs a P4. I have one of the older series for design engineers, and it's a T9400 which is Core2 and still supports TXT. Of course, I'm at the very end of my model's life and moving to SNB within the next month or two. Reply actionjksn - Wednesday, June 20, 2012 - link How much do you want for the T9400 Processor and is it compatible with a laptop that has a T7300? Reply microlithx - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link DRM, mainly. TrustZone is what Apple and all the Android vendors use to lock down their bootloaders. Netflix requires such locks to appease the MPAA. Reply taltamir - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Trusted computing is the holy grail of DRM. The name comes from a CIA in joke, you can only trust a system you compromised and whose user has less control then you do. It includes hardware chips that verify the hash of software before it is allowed to run. Making it impossible to get a virus. It also makes it impossible to run open source software and it allows remote censorship. They can decide for example that a certain document needs to go, they send a kill signal and any trusted computing computer out there deletes all copies of said document without the user consent. Reply taltamir - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link It should be noted that to leverage it in such a manner it needs to be standard everywhere. The hardware makers already put it everywhere. But the problem is laws, which is why there are ongoing attempts to make it legally required (just like for a time HDCP was mandated by law). So far they have failed to do so in the USA. And have yet to mandate big brother. Reply Jaybus - Thursday, June 14, 2012 - link It is really quite annoying and downright frightening. An implementation for consumer protection is one thing. For example, modern cars have an electronic ignition key that prevents thieves from making a plain mechanical key and driving off with it. But the key and car, once paired, make a standalone system. Ford can't remotely revoke the key if they decide that you are not driving the car in compliance with an "end user license". Sound crazy? Well, the car and key combination is a form of TPM. It is certainly possible from a technology standpoint for the car to phone home and validate the key. This whole DRM / TPM thing is subverting the very concept of ownership. What does it mean these days to own something? Do you really own something if someone else can control whether or not you may use it? If this is the future, then the future is not unlike the "company store" concept from the 19th century.

One of these stocks is an industry juggernaut, the other is an opportunistic bet on a cyclical upturn. One of them could work in your portfolio -- maybe even both. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Oct 29, 2016 at 10:45AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have a lot in common, and a long history of working together. Personally, I own both stocks. But if you had to choose one of these chip stocks to buy today, which one would it be? Let's have a look. By the numbers Let's get this out of the way right at the beginning. Intel is a far larger and more diverse business than Micron. This shows in many ways, including the stock charts. If you are a growth-thirsty thrill seeker, one look at this chart will tell you that Micron is right up your alley in ways that Intel just isn't. On the other hand, risk-averse value hunters will reach exactly the opposite conclusion: MU Total Return Price data by YCharts And if that wasn't obvious enough, these fundamental financial differences between Micron and Intel just might tip your scales: Financial Metric Intel Micron Revenue (TTM) $57.9 billion $12.4 billion Net Income (TTM) $10.4 billion $(276) million EBITDA Profit (TTM) $22.3 billion $3.3 billion Total Cash $17.8 billion $4.4 billion Total Debt $27.6 billion $9.9 billion Credit Rating A1 (medium investment-grade) Ba3 (non-investment grade, speculative) Data from Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trailing twelve months. It really doesn't matter how you slice it. Intel always comes out as the more stable and reliable choice in this contest. The company's credit rating is comparable to that of major banks, and better than those of some European countries. But a bank or a country with Micron's risky credit rating is standing with one leg in all-out bankruptcy already. Micron is neither a bank nor a country, though -- plenty of respectable businesses get by just fine with speculative-grade credit ratings. But interest rates will be higher when they take out loans, and these ratings are a good indication of business risk. In a nutshell, Intel is a low-risk investment, while Micron investors must accept a higher level of financial risk. The case for Micron If all signs point in favor of Intel, why would anybody want to own Micron instead? Micron's chosen trade is extremely cyclical. Sure, Intel's order volume moves up and down with the economy, with the short-term popularity of PC systems, with the global need for big-iron enterprise servers, and many other factors. But none of these market-moving factors can hold a candle to the drastic ups and downs of the computer memory market. In short, Micron is subject to all of the same product demand drivers that affect Intel -- plus regularly occurring price wars that have nothing to do with end-user demand. When memory market leaders Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Hynix, and Micron get along, street prices for memory chips can hold steady for years at a time. In these times of prosperity, Micron's sales and profits skyrocket. The stock generally follows suit. That's what happened in 2012-2014. At the time, Micron had a a newfound pricing power thanks to the recently completed buyout of bankrupt rival Elpida, and the company used this power to full effect. Holding back on production volumes, Micron shifted the global supply-and-demand equation significantly, and memory prices stabilized in a big way: MU data by YCharts Right now, Micron is knee-deep in yet another price war. Samsung is putting the production pedal to the metal, not terribly worried about the effect this market-flooding action is having on memory prices. The Korean giant can afford to take some losses in an attempt to increase its market share, because memory chips are just a small part of a much larger technology conglomerate. Micron doesn't have that luxury to the same degree, as any change in memory prices shows up immediately on the bottom line. That effect has killed plenty of vulnerable memory producers over the years. This is the largest risk, and it weighs heavily on Micron's credit ratings and financial future. As cyclical markets go, this downturn shall eventually pass. One of these days, Samsung will have reached its internal market share goals and shifted into profit-taking mode. Production volumes go down, memory prices stabilize again, and the survivors of the last shakeout get to share another bonanza. Buying Micron today is a bet on this company making it to that next party date. That's a bet I'm perfectly willing to make, thanks to Micron's robust cash balance and solid cash flows even in the face of Samsung's worst market floods. Which stock should you buy? Intel and Micron play very different roles, but are both very welcome parts of my investment portfolio. Micron's next upturn will come, and Intel will continue to chug along like the unstoppable juggernaut it is. If you're on the sidelines of both stocks today, one of these investments will be a much better fit for your investment strategy than the other. Choose accordingly.

That effect has killed plenty of vulnerable memory producers over the years. This is the largest risk, and it weighs heavily on Micron's credit ratings and financial future. As cyclical markets go, this downturn shall eventually pass. One of these days, Samsung will have reached its internal market share goals and shifted into profit-taking mode. Production volumes go down, memory prices stabilize again, and the survivors of the last shakeout get to share another bonanza. Buying Micron today is a bet on this company making it to that next party date. That's a bet I'm perfectly willing to make, thanks to Micron's robust cash balance and solid cash flows even in the face of Samsung's worst market floods. Which stock should you buy? Intel and Micron play very different roles, but are both very welcome parts of my investment portfolio. Micron's next upturn will come, and Intel will continue to chug along like the unstoppable juggernaut it is. If you're on the sidelines of both stocks today, one of these investments will be a much better fit for your investment strategy than the other. Choose accordingly. But for long-term omnivores like yours truly, there are no bad choices here. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel and Micron Technology. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Thunderbolt 3 explained: The one port to rule them all Elyse Betters29 October 2016Laptops Intel Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Let's face it: ports are boring. USB, Firewire, eSATA, etc: they're not sexy, but they're important. They decide what you can do on your device and how quickly you can do it. So, when Apple introduced its latest MacBook Pro laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports, you probably didn't think much about it - until you realised that Apple ditched every single port on its old machines and replaced it with just Thunderbolt 3. So, what does that mean? Well, if you want to connect anything to the new MacBook Pro, you'll need to do so via the Thunderbolt 3 ports. You can't simply plug in your devices via existing cables and connectors. If you want to do anything with the new MacBook Pros, you're going to need to buy new cables or adapters with a USB Type-C connector (about £226 worth, in fact). Why would Apple do this? The answer is easy: Thunderbolt 3 is the one port to rule them all. Here's everything you need to know. What is Thunderbolt 3? Intel introduced the Thunderbolt platform in 2011 at a time when USB 3.0 was all the rage and could transfer data at speeds up to 5Gbps. Thunderbolt was capable of twice that, plus it could transfer multiple types of data, not just serial data to storage devices. It could, for instance, pipe video data to displays. It could also daisy chain devices together, such as your hard drive to your computer and a display to your hard drive. Intel Thunderbolt 3 is the latest version of Thunderbolt, and it uses the same design as the familiar USB Type-C connector. Intel uses the new connector for a number of reasons. Early versions of Thunderbolt relied on a Mini DisplayPort style connector, and Apple was the only major manufacturer to embrace Thunderbolt. But now that Thunderbolt uses a USB Type-C connector, it is starting to show up in not just new MacBook Pros but also new ultrabooks and notebooks. Thunderbolt 3 first appeared with Intel's Skylake chips that rolled out in 2015, so that's why you're seeing a tonne of devices showing up this year with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple is sticking with Thunderbolt 3 because it can do a lot with a single cable. It supports the DisplayPort protocol, for instance, so you can use one cable to daisy-chain and drive multiple 4K displays at 60Hz. Thunderbolt 3 allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of the previous generation, USB 3.1 10Gbps, and DisplayPort 1.2. It also offers USB speeds of up to 10Gbps, and it can connect up to two 4K displays, outputting video and audio signal at the same time. It also supports DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, and 10GbE fast networking. Plus, Thunderbolt 3 is backwards compatible to Thunderbolt 2. What is USB Type-C? Thunderbolt 3 first features a USB Type-C connector. USB Type-C is the latest USB connector that everyone's talking about. It's replacing Micro-USB connectors used by most Android phones and even USB Type-A, which is the standard USB connector people imagine when they hear "USB". Apple's 12-inch MacBook even has a single USB Type-C port. Pocket-lint USB Type-C is well-known because it allows for quicker data transfer. By default, USB Type C offers 7.5W and 15W transmissions, whereas USB 3.0 offers 4.5W transmission. USB Type-C also allows your devices to charge, because it can transmit up to 100W, which is enough to charge most laptops. That means you can use a single cable with a USB Type-C connector to quickly transfer data to your device while you charge it. But the most interesting thing about USB Type-C is that the connector is reversible: there is no "right way up". You can just blindly stick it into a port on a device, and it'll smoothly go in and work. Why is Apple using Thunderbolt 3? Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 not only because of its USB Type-C connector but also because of Thunderbolt 3's features. One computer port can connect you to Thunderbolt devices, all displays, and billions of USB devices. It provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying up to 100W of power. You can use it to connect your Mac to displays, transfer data quickly between computers and hard drives, daisy chain external devices, and power up - all with just one physical connection. Intel For years, Macs have had USB ports and Thunderbolt ports and now they're combined. The thing to remember about Thunderbolt 3 is that although it uses the same shape connector as USB Type-C, it offers support for a wider range of different standards (HDMI, USB, DisplayPort), and it does everything faster while supplying power. You just need the right cable to plug into it. Not all USB Type-C ports support Thunderbolt 3. While smartphones and tablets may use the connector, the Thunderbolt platform is only available on devices with Intel processors. So, while you can technically plug any USB Type-C device or cable into a Thunderbolt 3 port, it won't support Thunderbolt's features. And a Thunderbolt 3 peripheral plugged into a regular USB Type-C port won't support Thunderbolt features either. Do other laptops use Thunderbolt 3? Pocket-lint Apart from Apple's latest MacBook Pro laptops, tonnes of laptops offer Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Asus Transformer 3 and Transformer 3 Pro, Alienware 13, Dell XPS 13, HP Elite X2 and Folio, HP Spectre and Spectre x360, Razer Blade Stealth, Lenovo ThinkPad Y900, and dozens more have shipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Ultrabook Review has a comprehensive list of all the laptops now available with Thunderbolt 3. Want to know more? Check out the Thunderbolt 3 promo video above and Intel's FAQ page.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte lets loose a flurry of BIOS updates with Kaby Lake support by Bruno Ferreira  3:42 PM on October 28, 2016 And then there were none. On the heels of Asus and MSI, Gigabyte has now announced BIOS updates for its existing LGA 1151 motherboards, adding support for Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake CPUs. The motherboard vendor says it's "tested and validated" the new firmware across its entire lineup of 100-series mobos. Of course, Gigabyte doesn't spell "Kaby Lake" out loud, but not only has that horse fled the barn, it's already died of old age. If anyone asks, though, tell them it's "Intel Next-Gen CPUs." Gigabyte says that all motherboards with H110, B150, H170, and Z170 chipsets now have BIOS updates fresh from the oven. Users can install the updates using their mobo's "Q-Flash" utility. Owners of motherboards with Gigabyte's specialty "Q-Flash Plus" white USB port have it a little easier. On those models, there's no need to plug in a CPU or memory—a USB stick containing the new firmware is all it takes.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Apple's New MacBook Pro Machines Are Thinner, Lighter, Faster Qualcomm to Pay $47 Billion for Chip Maker NXP BlackBerry Launches Its Licensed DTEK60 Android Smartphone Lenovo, Fujitsu Confirm Negotiations Regarding PC Tie-Up       Today's topics include Apple's three new MacBook Pro models, Qualcomm's $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, BlackBerry's launch of its new DTEK60 Android smartphone, and Lenovo and Fujitsu's negotiation regarding a future partnership. Apple unveiled three new redesigned MacBook Pro models on Oct. 27, bringing key improvements to its popular laptops, from thinner and lighter profiles to a new Touch Bar that replaces the top row of clickable function keys with a touch-screen keyboard strip. The latest MacBooks arrive in three versions—a 15-inch model with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core 2.6 GHz processor, 16GB of 2,133MHz memory, up to 2TB of SSD storage and the new Touch Bar; a 13-inch model with a choice of sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 dual-core processors, 8GB of 2,133MHz memory and the new Touch Bar; and a second 13-inch model that comes with a standard row of function keys instead of the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar reacts to taps and swipes and works with various applications to give users custom menus and keys that are specific to different applications.  Qualcomm is buying rival chip maker NXP Semiconductors in a $47 billion bid to rapidly expand beyond its core mobile device space and challenge Intel in such important emerging markets as the internet of things. After weeks of speculation, Qualcomm and NXP officials on Oct. 27 announced the largest deal in the chip space, surpassing the $37 billion that Avago Technologies paid for Broadcom late last year and continuing a years-long consolidation trend in the computer processor industry. The move will create a combined company with annual revenues of about $35 billion, serve markets that estimated to be worth $138 billion by 2020, and provide strong positions in such areas as mobile devices, automotive technology, the internet of things, security, radio-frequency technologies and networking, officials said. BlackBerry has rolled out its latest Android smartphone, the $499 DTEK60 high-security handset, which is the first phone the company has released since it declared in September that it would no longer build and distribute its own phone hardware. The DTEK 60, which is being licensed with the BlackBerry name and is being manufactured by China's TCL Corp., includes a 5.5-inch quad HD display, a special coating to resist smudges and fingerprints, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of memory, 32GB of on-board storage and a microSD slot for expanded storage. The handset also has a 21-megapixel auto-focus rear camera and an 8-megapixel front camera with flash, a fingerprint reader, BlackBerry's Intelligent Keyboard and a 3,000mAh rechargeable battery. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Officials with Lenovo and Fujitsu confirmed that they are in talks regarding the future of Fujitsu's PC business, but what the result of those negotiations will be remains unclear. The companies said in a joint statement that Lenovo, Fujitsu and Fujitsu Client Computing—the subsidiary created by Fujitsu in February to manage the PC business—are considering a "strategic cooperation" in the areas of PC research, development, design and manufacturing. Details of what the cooperation will be are under discussion, they said. They did say that the end result will include Fujitsu's keeping its own brand of PCs.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home Articles Cases, Cooling & PSU Editorials CPU Cooler Testing and Methodology (October 2016) TweakTown gets a new CPU cooler test system as well as a revised testing methodology. Find out how and why we test the way we do. By: Chad Sebring | Editorials in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: Oct 28, 2016 4:42 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Introduction] Page 1 [Introduction] Page 2 [Test System Components] Page 3 [Software and Settings] Page 4 [Stock Fan and Thermal Testing] Page 5 [Thermal Paste and Overclocked Testing] Page 6 [Final thoughts] Introduction     The time has come for yet another system upgrade in which we will bench CPU coolers for the next couple of years. With Intel Kaby Lake just around the corner, we would have loved to wait it out and get the latest and greatest of processors to run with this system, but due to degradation to our older system, we are no longer able to keep the system stable with the voltages we had used in the past. The ASUS Z97 Sabertooth and the Intel Core i7 4770K have been troopers for us.   They allowed us to bring you over ninety coolers and rate them according to thermal characteristics as well as delivering audio results. This way consumers are well informed in purchasing one of the multitudes of options out there to cool your CPU of choice.     You will soon see that not only has our system changed but so has our methodology. Where we feel we have failed the customers in the past was in our control of the fan voltage. Where most users buy a cooler, plug it into the fan header, and tend to use the PWM fan curve of the fan included with the cooler, we feel we were taking the effort of the cooler manufacturers out of the equation. This has led us to not only change our testing methodology, but it also means we will be delivering six charts now rather than four, to compare all CPU coolers as they are intended to run.   The concept of this article is to offer our readers a comprehensive version of all factors that went into our CPU cooler test rig, the software we choose to use, and a step-by-step of how to repeat our results, should you have access to the same components. With minimal help from vendors, and a ton of support from TweakTown's owner, we can not only update our test system into more appropriate gear, but at the same time, we feel that we are covering all the angles now.   We can now deliver more accurate results, in a real-world fashion, not mucking about imposing our settings on them.

They’ve just taken a different form. From PC sticks to mini PCs to 2-in-1 PCs, personal computing is becoming even more diverse as we move away from the traditional tower form factor. One of the oldest “alternative” PC forms is the all-in-one or AIO that brings display and processing unit together under one roof. The AIO market has received no small interest this year, and is about to get even more interesting thanks to Microsoft’s recent reveal. If you’re in the market for one, especially with holiday sales coming up, you might want to take a peek at some of the choicest picks of all-in-one computers this year. Apple iMac This is the granddaddy of AIOs, even before AIOs became a thing. Evolving from the candy-colored boxes to clean and sleek slabs, the iMac has always been the poster boy of all-in-one-computers. Sadly, Apple has yet to refresh the line, though the 2015 models are by no means so outdated that they don’t matter anymore. The highest end iMac gets you a 27-inch 5120×2880 Retina 5K display, powered by either a Core i5 or i7 processor, 6th gen Intel Skylake. RAM starts at 8 GB but can go all the way up to 32 GB, with a 1 or 2 TB “Fusion Drive” that combines SSD and HDD. That configuration also includes an AMD Radeon R9 M395 with 2 GB of video memory. An overall solid performer, even for some light gaming. At least if you are a devoted macOS, formerly OS X, user. AOC Mars (Android-based Remix OS) AIOs started out as a “Windows or Mac” affair, but these days any OS can have their own AIO. Android is no stranger to getting ported to this or that device, whether it make sense or not, but that doesn’t mean it’s optimized for the experience. Enter Jide’s Remix OS, a spin of Android that turns the mobile OS into a desktop OS. While Jide has its own hardware, it has recently broken out to partner with other hardware makers to bring its Android flavor to a wider audience. One such partner is AOC, whose “Mars” Remix OS AIO aims to compete in that market. Somewhat. Compared to the iMac and other Windows AIOs, the AOC Remix AIO is going to be embarrassing in terms of specs. But considering this is Android, which is optimized for hardware with constraints, that won’t be a problem, at least not too much. It has a 23.8-inch 1080p screen, a 2 GHz Cortex-A53 Amlogic S905 CPU, 2 GB of RAM and 16 to 64 GB of storage. Remix OS has run on similar or even weaker hardware, so it’ll be just fine on this AOC AIO. Acer Chromebase 24 (Chrome OS) Even Chrome OS has an all-in-one computer! And this time more supported by Google, naturally. The Chromebase line is geared more towards the work place, especially for meetings, but, just like Chromebooks, that doesn’t mean it can’t be used for everyday computing as well. Admittedly, the Acer Chromebase 24 is more gifted than the AOC Remix OS AIO that it almost seems unfair, but to each manufacturer its own. At its best, the Acer Chromebase 24, model CA24I-7T, boasts of a 23.8-inch Full HD screen and an Intel Core i7, though of the older Haswell generation. There 8 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Curiously, its screen has 10-point touch support, though Chrome OS itself isn’t as touch-oriented compared to Android. Lenovo Yoga Home 900 We now dive head on to the world of Windows AIOs, but not without taking a side trip to the realm of oddity. It’s hard to describe the Lenovo Yoga Home 900 as an All-in-One when it looks all too much like an oversized tablet. And in truth, it is exactly that. Unlike all other AIOs, Lenovo’s strange contraption can actually run for about 3 hours when not connected to a power source. Also unlike most AIOs, it isn’t affixed to a stand and can lay flat on a table. So it’s a tablet-tabletop-desktop-in-one. The 27-inch 1080p screen supports 10-point multi-touch as well (remember, giant tablet). It runs on a more recent Intel Core i7 Skylake gen and is paired with an NVIDIA GeForce GT940 for graphics. For memory, it has 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of SSD storage. ASUS Zen AiO Pro In complete contrast, the ASUS Zen AiO Pro is as “plain” as it gets. And that is actually its strength. No gimmicks, no eccentric features. Just straight out productivity and serious business. It also offers all around good specs for any purpose and computing need. The 23.8-inch screen boasts of 4K resolution, the first hi-res display in our list, aside from the iMac. It is driven by a 6th gen Intel Core i7 with 16 GB of RAM. There’s also an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M inside, for more intensive graphics work. And gaming on the sides, of course. At around $1,500, it is also the middle ground when it comes to price and features. MSI Gaming 27T 6QE Most all-in-ones aren’t exactly geared towards process-heavy tasks, especially those involving number crunching and pixel pushing. Space constraints and physics mean they’re not exactly a gamer’s first choice of PC. MSI, however, begs to differ and proves it with its Gaming AIO series. Equipped with as much muscle as you can squeeze in such a tight space, the MSI Gaming all-in-one PCs offer a decent, though not perfect, gaming experience without taking up much space. The MSI Gaming 27T 6QE is the crowning glory of that line, boasting of a 6th gen Skylake Intel Core i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX 980M with 8 GB of GDDR5 video memory. The latter is particularly known for offering desktop-class graphics in a mobile form factor. There’s also 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and a 256 GB SSD driver for fast file processing. And while it might seem that the 27-inch 1080p screen is a downer, that also means that the processors are less taxed when it comes to rendering graphics. HP Envy 34 The HP Envy 34, on the other hand, has no issues about pushing graphics, as long as they’ve already been rendered before hand. This AIO was made for non-gaming entertainment in mind, and its obnoxiously wide curved screen is testament to that. Although not exactly the newest of the group (although just as well aged as the iMac), the Envy 34 is still unmatched when it comes to that very wide curved display. That’s 34-inches of curved WQHD+, yes there’s a “plus”, goodness, curved to a 2,000 mm radius. This will probably not be conducive for creating multimedia, but it’s perfect for consuming them afterwards. The specs aren’t middling either, with an Intel Skylake Core i5 or i7, 8 or 16 GB of memory and 2 TB of storage for all your movies. Microsoft Surface Studio And, of course, we can’t talk about “AIO” and “2016” without mentioning the Microsoft Surface Studio, which is sure to be the subject of discussions, ridicule, and criticism, in the coming days, weeks, and even months. It has everything you’ve heard above and then some. In terms of specs, it matches the MSI Gaming 27T in terms of raw computing power. In terms of oddity and touch, it outclasses the Lenovo Yoga Home 900. And in terms of price, it puts all of them to shame. That is, if they were competing for who has the highest figures. Admittedly, what makes the Surface Studio special isn’t the AIO itself but the accessories that come with it, one that has to be purchased separately. Sure, the ability to pull down and tilt the touch screen is great and all, but it doesn’t make much sense if it were not for the Surface Pen support. And that stylus, while useful by itself, becomes all the more useful with the Surface Dial. The Surface Studio is clearly marketed towards professional content creators, and its exorbitant price tag speaks to that. Wrap-up: To AIO or not to AIO Despite how much all-in-one computers have come, they’re still not as widely chosen compared to traditional desktops and laptops. They stand in a slightly niche market in between. On the one hand, you have the space savings of a laptop but none of its portability. On the other hand, you have close to the specs, and especially the screen size, of a desktop but stops short of really becoming one. So should you buy an all-in-one computer or not? As always, the answer is “it depends”. An AIO’s smaller footprint and sleeker look comes at a price, both figuratively and literally. In terms of capabilities and future-proofing, AIOs are closer to a laptop than a desktop. Both have most of their hardware fixed and can’t be upgraded. And while something like the MSI Gaming 27T and even the Microsoft Surface Studio comes close to decent gaming, it’s still a far cry from a regular desktop PC specifically assembled for gaming. But just like with laptops, not all computer users need that much power nor do they feel the urge to upgrade components every time a new one comes out.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 28, 2016 at 7:46AM Analyst Romit Shah (via Barron's) recently noted that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) outlook for operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2017 should be around 34%, based on statements made by Intel Executive Vice President Stacy Smith. Image source: Intel.  That higher-than-expected operating-expense guidance as a percentage of revenue, relative to his prior expectations, could be tied to the company's worse-than-expected performance in its data-center group. "Amid weakness in data center, higher spending could signify something spookier, such as a defense move (i.e., more custom projects) to stem market share loss," the analyst writes. I don't doubt for a second that this higher-than-expected spending outlook is due to fairly significant incremental investments in the company's data-center group. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially when investors consider the alternative. Understanding the reality of the situation Intel's main growth engine at this point is its data-center group. The growth in this business has been one of the key reasons Intel has been able to keep its total revenues flat to up over the past several years, even as its core personal-computer business has deteriorated significantly. Right now, Intel's data-center group has the benefit of both being exposed to a number of growth markets -- such as cloud servers, networking infrastructure, and high-performance computing -- and limited competition. So far, the threat from ARM architecture-based servers -- which has loomed over Intel for years -- hasn't materialized. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors that could allow these ARM-based server players to build more competitive products in the coming years. Should the ARM players, or perhaps competitors using alternative architectures, manage to capture a significant amount of share in the server market -- ARM predicts that its partners will, collectively, capture around 25% share in the server market -- this would significantly hurt Intel's long-term prospects. Indeed, server share loss of that magnitude could wipe tens of billions off of Intel's market capitalization. So Intel has to do absolutely everything in its power to make sure that it doesn't start hemorrhaging server market share. Intel's R&D might is its best weapon When all is said and done, Intel's best defense mechanism against a broad set of competitors in the server market is its sheer research-and-development might. No single semiconductor company out there today is both willing and able to spend what Intel can and does to support its data-center products. Indeed, one reason Intel is able to spend more than others is that it has the advantage of having a data-center business that brings in north of $16 billion in revenue each year. This large revenue base gives Intel the ability to spend fairly lavishly on research and development while allowing for a healthy level of profitability. Another reason that Intel can outspend its peers is that many of the core technologies that it builds in support of its other businesses -- personal computers, the Internet of Things, and so on -- can be leveraged in the company's data-center product portfolio -- a point that former Intel CFO spent a lot of time making back at the company's 2014 investor meeting. It simply makes sense for Intel to put the pedal to the metal on these investments before any of its competitors are able to reach any sort of scale. If Intel can consistently outrun the competition, it should only be a matter of time before those other companies decide that there are better uses of their cash than trying to compete with Intel on its own turf. Intel is playing a long-term game; we'll see if the strategy ultimately plays out when the server processor market share numbers come in over the next three to five years.

Define your site main menu How to Solve “PXE-E61 Media Test Failure, Check Cable” Error PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) is a boot environment that Intel created. The PXE allows a workstation to boot up by using a network interface before it boots the operating system from the local storage devices such as the hard disk. When hard disk boot failure occurs, the computer will not boot up and a message saying “PXE-E61: Media Test Failure, Check Cable” appears. The error may also read “PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel PXE-ROM” or “Boot Failure: System Halted.” This error message repeats each time one attempts to start up the computer and it restricts one’s access to the hard disk data. Hard disk boot failure in PXE can happen for several reasons. The most common reason is physical hard disk failure due to a faulty or improperly connected hard disk. The error might also occur if a computer attempts to boot from a device and it cannot find the necessary boot files. The error can also appear because of incorrect BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) settings. The BIOS contains instructions about how the computer boots. The BIOS can only be updated or modified with BIOS updates. The CMOS contains the system settings and a CMOS battery powers it. The CMOS can be changed or modified by entering the CMOS setup. The setup for the BIOS and CMOS are the same, but the BIOS and CMOS on the motherboard are not the same. Below are steps to access the BIOS and CMOS to help solve the error. How to Find the Cause and Fix “PXE-E61 Media Test Failure, Check Cable” Error It is important to isolate the cause of the “PXE-E61 Media Test Failure, Check Cable” error and solve it. To do this, follow the steps below: A loose or improper hard disk cable connection can be the cause of the error. This typically happens if the hard disk has recently been installed or moved. Check all of the hard disk’s cable connections before trying anything else to solve the error. Make sure that no other storage device is connected to the computer. If there is a storage device connected, remove it. When computer start up is being attempted, enter the BIOS to see if the hard disk has been set up correctly and detected in BIOS. To enter the BIOS, follow these steps: a. The key that must be pressed to enter the BIOS varies depending on the computer model. The key is most likely the Del key or one of the F keys. Many computers refer to this as Entering Setup and Setup is just another term used for the BIOS. b. Try setting one’s BIOS to any safe default settings. That might fix the error. Verify that the boot options in CMOS are setup correctly. Follow these steps to do this: a. Enter the CMOS by pressing one of the following keys: F1, F2, Del, Esc, or F10. Press one of these keys when trying to start up the computer. If these keys do not work, try holding one or more keys on the keyboard when the computer is booting. This may cause a Stuck Key Error, which should allow the user to enter the setup. b. If the CMOS setup shows an option to boot from the LAN, disable this option. c. Try to set the CMOS settings to any safe default settings, then save and exit. After changing any settings, reboot the computer. It is possible that physical failure caused the error if the hard disk cannot be detected. If this is the case, replace the hard disk and restore one’s data if a good backup is available. If one does not have a good backup, contact a company that provides data recovery services. These companies perform hard disk recovery and securely retrieve one’s valuable data. Follow Us!

The P3100 is an M.2 design (22 x 80mm) built from 3D TLC (3bits/cell) NAND. This format has begun appearing in tablets, thin notebooks and desktops as it doesn't take up much space and the use of TLC (3bits/cell) NAND means capacities of up to 1TB are practical. However, the TLC use tends to mean devices are optimised more for reading data than writing it, TLC NAND having a lower endurance than MLC (2bits/cell) flash. Typically servers are not so limited for space and 2.5in SSDs are the norm. Intel is hoping that space-constrained servers with read IOs more important than write IOs will be a viable market for its P3100 SSD. Its random read/write IOPS are up to 114,000/10,000 and the sequential read/write bandwidth numbers are up to 1.8GBps and 175MBps. This performance profile is heavily optimised towards reading data. It supports 0.5 drive writes per day (DWPD) for three years, 0.3 DWPD for five years, and has a five-year warranty. The product draws 10mW in its idle state, which Intel says is 90 per cent less than a typical enterprise disk drive, and averages 5.5W when active. However, there is no power-loss data protection, although the drive does have AES-256 bit encryption. Data centre applications for the P3100 include being a boot device, search indexing, edge caching and web hosting according to Intel. For comparison, Intel's M.2 format 600p SSD is a client device, meaning notebook and tablet primarily, NVMe SSD with the same 3D TLC NAND media, capacity levels and 1.6 million hours MTBF rating as the P3100. Its random read/write IOPS are up to 155,000/128,000 and the sequential read/write bandwidth numbers are up to 1.8GBps and 560MBps. This has a nominally faster random read IOPS number and much, much faster random write write IOPS value; it being more balanced in its performance. Intel's business client Pro 6000p and and IoT E 6000p are, we understand, 600p variants The P3100 looks like a tweaked 600p. Intel DC P3100 specs Samsung has 960 EVO and 960 PRO M.2 client SSDs with capacities up to 1TB and using 3D NAND media (48-layer, 256Gbit 21nm TLC V-NAND). They are much faster than the P3100: 960 EVO Random read/write IOPS are up to 380,000/360,000 Sequential read/write bandwidth numbers are up to 3.2 and 1.9GBps 960 PRO Random read/write IOPS are up to 440,000/360,000 Sequential read/write bandwidth numbers are up to 3.5 and 2.1GBps Micron has an 1100 SSD in both 2.5in and M.2 formats, which uses a 6Gbps SATA interface. The M.2 100's capacities are 256GB, 512GB and 1TB using 32-layer 3D NAND. (The 2.5in version goes up to 2TB.) It has a 1.5 million hours MTBF rating, which contrasts with the P3100's 1l6 million hours. The performance numbers are: Random read/write IOPS are up to 92,000/83,000 Sequential read/write bandwidth numbers are up to 530 and 500MBps That makes it slower than the P3100 at reading but faster than writing. When the next generation 3D NAND comes around the block from Intel (and Micron) then we should get 2TB M.2 SSD capacities and that should enable faster write IO and longer endurance in DWPD terms, both of which could endear the format more to server suppliers than this 1TB toe in the data centre water.

Caption: Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 10.28.16. 10.28.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am How AI Is Shaking Up the Chip Market Clayton Cotterell for WIRED In less than 12 hours, three different people offered to pay me if I’d spend an hour talking to a stranger on the phone. All three said they’d enjoyed reading an article I’d written about Google building a new computer chip for artificial intelligence, and all three urged me to discuss the story with one of their clients. Each described this client as the manager of a major hedge fund, but wouldn’t say who it was. The requests came from what are called expert networks—research firms that connect investors with people who can help them understand particular markets and provide a competitive edge (sometimes, it seems, through insider information). These expert networks wanted me to explain how Google’s AI processor would affect the chip market. But first, they wanted me to sign a non-disclosure agreement. I declined. These unsolicited, extremely specific, high-pressure requests—which arrived about three week ago—underscore the radical changes underway in the enormously lucrative computer chip market, changes driven by the rise of artificial intelligence. Those hedge fund managers see these changes coming, but aren’t quite sure how they’ll play out. Of course, no one is quite sure how they’ll play out. Today, Internet giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and China’s Baidu are exploring a wide range of chip technologies that can drive AI forward, and the choices they make will shift the fortunes of chipmakers like Intel and nVidia. But at this point, even the computer scientists within those online giants don’t know what the future holds. Going Deep These companies run their online services from data centers packed with thousands of servers, each driven by a chip called a central processing unit, or CPU. But as they embrace a form of AI called deep neural networks, these companies are supplementing CPUs with other processors. Neural networks can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including everything from identifing faces and objects in photos to translating between languages, and they require more than just CPU power. And so Google built the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. Microsoft is using a processor called a field programmable gate array, or FPGA. Myriad companies employ machines equipped with vast numbers of graphics processing units, or GPUs. And they’re all looking at a new breed of chip that could accelerate AI from inside smartphones and other devices. Any choice these companies make matters, because their online operations are so vast. They buy and operate far more computer hardware than anyone else on Earth, a gap that will only widen with the continued importance of cloud computing.  If Google chooses one processor over another, it can fundamentally shift the chip industry. The TPU poses a threat to companies like Intel and nVidia because Google makes this chip itself. But GPUs also play an enormous role within Google and its ilk, and nVidia is the primary manufacturer of these specialized chips. Meanwhile, Intel has inserted itself into the mix by acquiring Altera, the company that sells all those FPGAs to Microsoft. At $16.7 billion, it was Intel’s largest acquisition ever, which underscores just how much the chip market is changing. First, Training. Then, Execution But sorting all this out is difficult—in part because neutral networks operate in two stages. The first is the training stage, where a company like Google trains the neural network to perform a given task, like recognizing faces in photos or translating from one language to another. The second is the execution stage, where people like you and me actually use the neural net—where we, say, post a photo of our high school reunion to Facebook and it automatically tags everyone in it. These two stages are quite different, and each requires a different style of processing. Today, GPUs are the best option for training. Chipmakers designed GPUs to render images for games and other highly graphical applications, but in recent years, companies like Google discovered these chips can also provide an energy-efficient means of juggling the mind-boggling array of calculations required to train a neural network. This means they can train more neural nets with less hardware. Microsoft AI researcher XD Huang calls GPUs “the real weapon.” Recently, his team completed a system that can recognize certain conversational speech as well as humans, and it took them about a year. Without GPUs, he says, it would have taken five. After Microsoft published a research paper on this system, he opened a bottle of champagne at the home of Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO of nVidia. But companies also need chips that can rapidly execute neural networks, a process called inference. Google built the TPU specifically for this. Microsoft uses FPGAs. And Baidu is using GPUs, which aren’t as well suited to inference as they are to training, but can do the job with the right software in place. To the Smartphone At the same time, others are building chips to help execute neural networks on smartphones and other devices. IBM is building such a chip, though some wonder how effective it might be. And Intel has agreed to acquire Movidius, a company that is already pushing chips into devices. Intel understands that the market is changing. Four years ago, the chip maker told us it sells more server processors to Google than it sells to all but four other companies—so it sees firsthand how Google and its ilk can shift the chip market. As a result, it’s now placing bets everywhere. Beyond snapping up Altera and Movidius, it has agreed to buy a third AI chip company called Nervana. That makes sense, because the market is only starting to develop. “We’re now at the precipice of the next big wave of growth,” Intel vice president Jason Waxman recently told me, “and that’s going to be driven by artificial intelligence.” The question is where the wave will take us.

The new MacBook Pro is thinner, lighter and comes complete with fingerprint scanner. It also continues Apple’s rollout of USB-C, which began with the MacBook last year. It has two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports along each side – four in total – that are used for both power and connectivity. However, there are no standard USB type A ports, which are still regarded as the global standard, and are used by Apple for their Lightning cable , which comes with the company’s iPhones. The new laptop does not come with the SD card reader, HDMI port, the two Thunderbolt ports that doubled as a mini DisplayPorts, or the two USB-A ports that the last model did, so will require adapters to use existing accessories. It also lacks the MagSafe power adapter, instead relying on USB-C. It does have a 3.5mm headphone socket, however. The biggest change to the design of the machine is a new OLED touch panel above the standard keyboard, which replaces the multi-function “F” keys, and allows dynamic shortcuts to functions such as volume control and window management. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple, said: “It’s a retina display, multitouch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software you’re using.” Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering for Apple, showed that the Touch Bar could be used for navigation in browsers, photo manipulation and text suggestions when typing. It can also suggest and insert emojis without leaving the keyboard. The right end of the strip now contains Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint scanner integrated into the power button, which is similar to the one fitted to the iPhone and iPad and can be used to unlock the laptop and confirm payments. The new Force Touch trackpad is also twice the size of the old one. Apple said the new 13in MacBook Pro can be equipped with dual-core versions of the Intel i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB storage and Intel’s Iris 550 integrated graphics chip with 103% faster gaming performance and 76% faster video editing and 3D graphics performance than the previous version. But the new 15in MacBook Pro is by far the more powerful, with a quad-core version of Intel’s i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It also comes with an AMD Radeon Pro 450 graphics chip that offers up to 4GB of video RAM, with 130% faster 3D graphics, 60% faster gaming and 57% faster video editing. Both models have up to 10 hours of battery life, Apple said. The new MacBook Pro will be for sale immediately, shipping in two to three weeks, with the 13in version costing $1,799 in the US and £1,749 in the UK and the 15in costing $2,399 in the UK and £2,349 in the UK. Apple is also making a lower specification 13in version without the Touch Bar, Touch ID and only two Thunderbolt ports costing $1,499 in the US and £1,449 in the UK, which will ship immediately. Apple has kept the 13in MacBook Air, but dropped the smaller 11in version. The company did not announce updates of its Mac Pro or iMac desktop computers. The new laptop, which has been favoured by those in the creative industry for years, is a key part of Apple’s Mac computer line, but has stood stagnant in recent times, seeing only small specifications increases since the introduction of the retina MacBook Pro in 2012. While a design and specification update will be welcomed, the dropping of ports and connectivity options has proved divisive in the past. USB-C is seen as the future of multi-purpose connections, but is still a new connector. It is primarily used by Android smartphones and tablets, but not with such accessories as external storage and cameras, two pieces of equipment that are often critical tools for creative professionals. The updates come at a time when Apple’s Mac shipments have seen three straight quarters of decline, culminating in a greater than 14% drop year-on-year in the last quarter. The decline follows Apple’s total sales of Macs growing by almost 6% in 2015, to which the launch of the new retina MacBook contributed. At the same time, total PC shipments shrank by 8% globally year-on-year in 2015 and 0.2% year-on-year in 2014, according to data from Gartner. Even Lenovo, the world’s largest PC manufacturer, has shown decreasing sales, down 3.1% in 2015 and down three straight quarters in 2016. Revenues from Apple’s Mac computers are now worth less than those of its services, such as the App Store and iTunes. The company will be hoping that the renewed laptops and computer will buoy sales and return the Mac line to second place behind the iPhone in total revenue contribution to Apple’s bottom line.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

How do these devices fare in terms of features, display, battery life, pricing and more? Let's find out.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple unveiled two new MacBook Pro models today at its event in San Francisco, following a steady buildup of leaks pre-event. Not to be outdone, Microsoft also revealed an upgraded Surface Book earlier on Wednesday, and naturally, tech enthusiasts would more than be pleased to see the two flagships spar. Before you Apple and Microsoft loyalists drool on the new piece of technology from both companies, let's try to compare the new MacBook Pro and the Surface Book and determine which gadget packs more punch for its value. Processor, Graphics And Storage There are three models available for the MacBook Pro. There's the 13-inch model sans the new Touch Bar, a multi-touch OLED strip that replaces the F keys row on the top of the laptop's keyboard. There's also a 13-inch and 15-inch model that do come with the new Touch Bar. The base model comes with sixth-generation Intel 2.0 GHz Core i5, 8 GB of RAM and an SSD with 256 GB of internal storage. There's even an option to beef it all the way up to 3.3 GHz Core i7 with 16 GB of RAM and an SSD with 1 TB of storage. There's an integrated Intel Iris for the base 13-inch model, while there's a Radeon Pro for the 15-inch model. Microsoft's not offering larger screens, instead opting for a single model, the 13-inch Surface Book. It comes with a sixth-generation core i5 processor with 8 GB of RAM and an SSD with 128 GB of storage. The Surface Book with Performance Base can offer both Intel HD and Nvidia GTX 965M graphics. The Surface Book is available in a host of spec configurations. For an increased price, you can get a model with a separate graphics card, so graphics-intensive games won't hog the processor. A Core i7 model is also available, with options to bump the SSD storage up to 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB. Display And Touch Inputs The new MacBook Pro 13-inch model comes with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 and 2,880 x 1,800 for the 15-inch model. These don't hold a candle to the Surface Book's 3,000 x 2,000 resolution even with a small 13-inch screen. The Surface Book features a 10-point multi-touch touchscreen display that supports the pressure-sensitive Surface Pen. Have we mentioned that the Surface Book can flip its screen around and shift into a tablet mode? Well, it can. The new MacBook Pro doesn't have a touchscreen or a bendable hinge, but it does have the aforementioned multi-touch OLED strip and a larger trackpad. In the screen department, the Surface is the clear winner here because of its multi-touch display, tablet mode and better resolution than that of the MacBook's. Ports The MacBook has four ports, and not one of them is something you'd find on a traditional laptop. Yes, Apple has put two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports in the base 13-inch MacBook Pro and four in the other two models, so good luck fumbling with the right adapters for your old USB devices. In the long run, maybe this is a good thing since USB-C is a versatile port for data transfers, battery charging and more. The Surface Book has two USB ports, a mini DisplayPort, an SD card reader and a charging port. While the newer MacBook Pro models are a step forward in innovation, Microsoft gets the point here for vast compatibility with traditional USB-enabled devices. Battery Life In terms of juice, the Surface Book appears to be the better opponent. Microsoft claims that you can squeeze 12 to 16 hours of battery life from the Surface Book, while Apple claims a much lesser 10-hour battery life in the newer MacBook Pro models. Pricing The 13-inch base MacBook Pro model starts at $1,499. Those with the Touch Bar will cost you $1,799 for the 13-inch and $2,399 for the 15-inch model. There's a much higher configuration for the 15-inch model, which comes with a 2.7 GHz Processor and 512 GB SSD, retailing for $2,799. The Surface Book starts at $1,349 and $2,399 for the beefier configuration. Conclusion Fans of the traditional USB port may find it hard to find something ultimately versatile about the new MacBook Pro. That said, it does still pack a punch in terms of specs, and the new Touch Bar does spell a tireless array of possibilities once developers start taking advantage of its functionality. For those of you who want to shell out more for Apple's new MacBook Pro, it still proves to be a nice investment despite the drawbacks because of the specs and the Touch Bar. Same thing with the Surface Book. In fact, these devices are both stellar even with the comparisons listed above, but if you want a touchscreen display and the versatility of a laptop that supports a tablet mode, then the Surface Book is a definite winner.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 27, 2016 at 8:29PM Early next year, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will release its seventh-generation Core processor family, formerly code-named Kaby Lake, for the desktop personal computer market -- a segment that Intel has said in the past generates more than $10 billion in revenue for the chipmaker.  An Intel executive holding a mobile-oriented seventh generation Core processor. Image source: Intel.  For those new to the story, Kaby Lake is essentially last year's Skylake processor (sixth-generation Core, in marketing speak) implemented in a new revision of Intel's 14-nanometer process with some very mild tweaks to the design to improve the performance and power consumption of video playback. For the low-power notebook market, Kaby Lake should deliver a nice boost in performance as a result of these enhancements. However, for the less-power-constrained desktop processor market -- particularly for more CPU-intensive tasks such as gaming -- these improvements (which will ultimately manifest themselves as slightly higher frequencies) are probably going to be underwhelming. If this were the best that Intel could do given the circumstances, then the company could get a pass. But it wasn't -- not by a long shot. Intel could have introduced higher-core-count models Next year, Intel is expected to release a processor family known as Coffee Lake for desktops. This, too, will be built on an enhanced 14-nanometer process (likely further enhanced from the 14-nanometer+ tech used to build the Kaby Lake processors), but with a couple of twists: Rather than recycle the same Skylake processor core again, Intel will be doing an implementation of its mildly enhanced version of Skylake, known as Cannon Lake, in that 14-nanometer process. Intel is expected to boost the processor core count in the top desktop Coffee Lake parts from four to six. The move to the Cannon Lake architecture should yield a roughly 5% improvement in performance at similar frequencies, but the real big bang (at the very least, from a marketing/public perception perspective) should be in the increase in maximum core count from four to six. Although it's nice that Intel is doing this with Coffee Lake, the company could have -- and should have -- introduced higher core counts with the imminent Kaby Lake processors. The additional cores at the top of the product stack would have allowed Intel to increase the core/thread counts across its desktop product stack, potentially spurring upgrade activity (particularly among gamers and PC enthusiasts). Why didn't Intel build six core Kaby Lake processors? Although I don't agree with Intel's decision to hold off on a six-core desktop/high-performance notebook processor until the first half of 2018, there must have been some rationale behind this decision. An obvious explanation that comes to mind is simply cost structure. If Intel decided to, say, replace quad-core parts with hex-core parts, and dual-core parts with quad-core parts across the product stack, then the average silicon die size would go up across the board. The increase in die size (which would drive an increase in product manufacturing costs) could lead to lower product margins if the company simply winds up selling more features/silicon at the same price points as before. However, what Intel could have done is to introduced a hex-core part as a sort of premium desktop chip that sits on top of the fastest quad-core in the company's product stack. Intel could conceivably charge even more for such a part, not only alleviating the potential cost structure problem (the more-expensive-to-build chip would simply be more expensive), but potentially boosting its product average selling prices. Another potential explanation, then, is that Intel simply didn't want to dedicate the engineering resources to building a separate hex-core chip for this market until recently. Given Intel's gargantuan research-and-development budget, this explanation might not seem likely. However, since the previous general manager of Intel's client computing group outright admitted that Intel skipped out on doing an entire generation of desktop processors to save some research and development dollars (something that, to this day, blows my mind), anything is possible.

Nick Knupffer Why Intel's new Kaby Lake processors won't make your computer much faster 0 Share: Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 6:03 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? Intel turns to Overwatch to show off seventh-generation core Intel's CEO put his company's new core processor to the test on stage by playing Overwatch. 0:57 Close Drag Apple's new MacBook Pro is an eye-catching new computer. So are Microsoft's new Surface Studio and upgraded Surface Book. But none of them use Intel's latest processors. Is that a big deal? Not as much as you'd think. Here's our explainer from August on what "Kaby Lake" really means for your next PC. Original story published August 17: The clock has stopped. The chips are down. Intel's seventh-gen Core processors, codename Kaby Lake, are now official -- but they aren't as big an upgrade as you'd expect from Intel. Sure, they're a little bit faster and a little bit more power-efficient. But the best thing about Intel new CPUs might actually be this: the deals you'll find on PCs with last year's chips. Here's why Kaby Lake isn't such a big deal. What's a Kaby Lake? Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, the latest and greatest CPUs the company has to offer. They're the successor to Intel's sixth-gen "Skylake" processors from 2015. But Kaby Lake isn't a true successor to Skylake. It's more like Skylake+. Usually, Intel creates a powerful new processor architecture, then the following year shrinks down the circuits for better efficiency. (Intel, much like Ke$ha, is industry-famous for that "Tick-Tock" product cycle.) Enlarge Image Kaby Lake isn't huge. It's about twice the size of California's Lake Tahoe -- a popular vacation spot for Silicon Valley residents. Photo by Google Maps But Kaby Lake doesn't do either of those things. The circuits are the same 14 nanometer size as Intel's earlier Skylake and Broadwell chips, and it's not a new architecture either. Intel had been trying to shrink down to 10nm with a processor called Cannonlake, but those chips were delayed. So for now, we're stuck at Tock. No, really, what's a Kaby Lake? Is "Kaby" a kind of fish? Oh. No, it appears to be an actual lake in Canada. Maybe the CEO enjoys hunting moose in his spare time? Is Kaby Lake any better than my existing computer processor? Intel thinks so! The company says its thin laptop chips are 12 percent faster than Skylake in raw performance, and far more efficient at decoding 4K video. In fact, Intel claims you could get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming YouTube 4K videos (7 vs. 4 hours) compared to last year's chips. And for gamers, the company even showed an incredibly thin laptop playing fast-paced shooter Overwatch reasonably well. That sounds great, no? Sure -- until you take a hard look at how Intel generated those numbers. It's not too surprising that Intel's Kaby Lake CPU ran 12 percent faster than the comparable Skylake -- because the new chip is clocked 12 percent faster anyhow! Which could be a problem, because faster clock speeds tend to generate more heat and consume more battery as well. Enlarge Image Intel shows performance gains of 12 percent. Perhaps it's because the chip is working 12 percent harder? Photo by Intel And while Intel's battery life numbers for 4K video are hard to ignore, Intel tells me that battery life should be "similar" -- not necessarily better than Skylake -- across other kinds of workloads. We could easily be in a situation like Intel's Broadwell vs. Haswell, where the company claimed better performance with the same battery life, but devices actually consumed a bit more battery in real-world use. I'm optimistic, though, and we'll need to test for sure. What about the gaming performance? I wouldn't get too excited just yet. We took a closer look at Overwatch on a Dell XPS 13 with the new Intel chip, and it ran pretty smooth...but with a few caveats. Judge for yourself: Also note that Intel may still have some more powerful graphics in the near future: we haven't yet seen how far the company's souped-up Intel Iris graphics have come. Are there any sleek new laptops or tablets coming with Kaby Lake, at least? Sure! Feast your eyes on the new Acer Swift 7: 9 An early look at the ultra-thin Acer Swift 7 laptop We also saw a sleek HP Spectre with a new OLED panel, a refreshed Dell XPS 13, and a 6.9mm-thick Asus detachable tablet -- the Asus T305 -- with a fingerprint reader built right into the power button. Intel says there'll be over 100 different slim computers with Kaby Lake chips by the end of the year. When will Kaby Lake start showing up in new PCs? Enlarge Image Intel CVP Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake chip. Photo by Sean Hollister/CNET Well, that's the other thing...we'll see the first Kaby Lake computers in September and October, but only the types of chips that go into thin laptops and tablets. Quad-core laptop chips (like you'd find in a MacBook Pro), laptop chips with Iris graphics, business-class laptop chips with vPro and desktop chips won't appear until early next year. On the plus side, rumor has it you won't need a new motherboard for Kaby Lake desktop chips. They'll allegedly use the same LGA1151 socket as their Skylake predecessors. Will they appear in the new MacBook Pro? Depends on Apple (and Intel), but there's a decent chance they won't. Apple typically uses the most powerful Intel laptop processors available -- the 28-watt ones with better Intel graphics -- and again, Intel says they won't be ready until early next year. That's not nearly enough time to get them ready for Apple's September 7 event. However, Bloomberg reports that Apple won't refresh the Macs until later this year, and it wouldn't be the first time Intel has given chips to Apple ahead of schedule. And if Apple decides to refresh the MacBook Air -- another Bloomberg rumor -- those thinner Intel laptop chips are now ready. Update, October 27: Apple isn't using them. Everything you need to know about the major MacBook Pro upgrade After 4 plus years we'll finally see an all new MacBook Pro laptop. We could see the Apple Watch 2 and an updated first-gen Apple Watch this year. New iPhone 7 details, plus Apple TV is now looking to be a TV Guide. Yikes. by Brian Tong 5:59 Close Drag Should I wait to buy a new PC or Mac until Kaby Lake is available? It definitely couldn't hurt. It's usually better to get the latest and greatest if you can afford it -- and Kaby Lake definitely sounds better if you watch 4K video. But as I've outlined above, most PCs probably won't get a big boost to performance or battery life with Kaby Lake silicon. The real reason to wait: you'll almost certainly find some excellent discounts on Skylake computers once Kaby Lake hits the market. What about AMD's Zen? The Intel rival's new built-from-the-ground-up chips sound promising, but you won't be able to drop one into a desktop till 2017. AMD's new laptop chips will take even longer -- expect them in the second half of next year. How will I tell Kaby Lake apart from previous processors when I'm computer shopping? In one important way, Intel's making it easier than ever before: it'll say "7th gen" right on the familiar Intel sticker you'll find on the palmrest of a new laptop. It's a change we've been asking for. Enlarge Image The new "7th-gen" Intel Core branding scheme. Photo by Intel Unfortunately, Intel also made another change that could prove even more confusing. Ever heard of Core M, Intel's line of ultra-low-power 4.5-watt processors for incredibly thin, fanless PCs? As of now, the company's Core m5 and Core m7 processors are part of the Core i5 and Core i7 family, respectively. That means if you purchase a laptop with a "Core i7" label, it may not offer nearly the same sustained performance as a Core i7 machine from last year. Of course, a thin laptop's Core i7 chip already wasn't as powerful as a thick laptop's Core i7 chip, and neither were as powerful as a Core i7 desktop chip, so perhaps we're just continuing that trend. These days, it's really the size of your PC that indicates its potential performance. Besides, you can still tell the M chips apart if you look at the full model number. If you see a Y (e.g. Core i7-7Y75), it's one of the lower-performance processors. I like specs and codenames. Which processors are actually being announced today? Only six: Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo) Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo) Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) Is Moore's Law dead? How could you possibly suggest such a thing? We're simply waiting for the clock's second hand to remember how to tick.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 28 October 2016 | MYT 8:30 AM Apple launches new MacBook Pro models by tan kit hoong New notebooks: The new MacBook Pros come in 13in and 15in versions with Retina displays. As expected, Apple's Hello Again event raised the curtains on a new MacBook Pro lineup. The biggest change in the new MacBook Pros (which come in 13in and 15in versions) is a new Touch Bar which is small display strip above the keyboard which shows you contextual icons, such as volume controls, word suggestions and even emojis. However that's not all the Touch Bar does – with certain apps it also takes over some of the features of the trackpad to allow you to say, have more fine control over the rotation of images, something which is done better on the Touch Bar because of its extended length compared to the Trackpad. The Touch Bar shows contextual icons and functions depending on the application you're running. The Touch Bar also integrates a Touch ID fingerprint sensor similar to the one on the iPhone so you can authenticate purchases and login using your finger. Not all the models have the Touch Bar, however – the lower-end model of the 13in MacBook Pro will have a regular row of function keys. True to the normal Apple style, the company has slimmed down the casing – the MacBook Pros are how up to 17% thinner than the previous model – and also upped the specifications by including the latest Intel processors, faster graphics and a new Retina display that's brighter, higher contrast and with a wider colour gamut than before. Graphics-wise the 13in models feature the latest Intel Skylake Core i5 processors  – the more basic non-Touch Bar version uses Intel's Iris Graphics 540 GPU while the 13in model with all the new features uses Intel's Iris Graphics 550 GPU. The 15in model features a more powerful AMD Radeon Pro 450 GPU, so this is the model you want if you're doing some graphically-intensive editing of photos or videos. There are up to four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports on the new MacBooks. Notice that Apple has retained the 3.5mm headphone port. In terms of ports, Apple has done away with its classic MagSafe connector – the MacBooks now feature up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports on either side which also serve as charging ports so you can plug the charger into any of these ports to charge the MacBook. The Thunderbolt 3 ports are fully compatible with USB-C standard, so any USB-C device can be plugged into the Thunderbolt 3 port – there are no more full-sized USB ports on the new MacBooks, although an adapter will give you these ports if you need them. Unfortunately, Apple has also done away with most of the other ports so there's no HDMI output port or DisplayPort and no SD card reader slot -- if you need any of these ports it's available with a dongle that plugs into the Thunderbolt port. Surprise – unlike the iPhone 7, though, there is a headphone port so you can still plug in your regular wired headphones into the MacBook. Other notable changes – the trackpad is now larger and reportedly supports a number of new gestures and the solid-state drives (SSDs)  are now up to 100 times faster than the last generation MacBook which should translate to significantly more snappy performance overall. The new MacBook Pros are available to order right now on the Apple Malaysia site – the non-Touch Bar 13in version starts at RM6,299, while the 13in model with Touch Bar starts at RM7,599 and the 15in Touch Bar model starts at a whopping RM10,199. The Apple Malaysia website lists them all shipping in six to eight weeks.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 27, 2016 at 8:29PM Early next year, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will release its seventh-generation Core processor family, formerly code-named Kaby Lake, for the desktop personal computer market -- a segment that Intel has said in the past generates more than $10 billion in revenue for the chipmaker.  An Intel executive holding a mobile-oriented seventh generation Core processor. Image source: Intel.  For those new to the story, Kaby Lake is essentially last year's Skylake processor (sixth-generation Core, in marketing speak) implemented in a new revision of Intel's 14-nanometer process with some very mild tweaks to the design to improve the performance and power consumption of video playback. For the low-power notebook market, Kaby Lake should deliver a nice boost in performance as a result of these enhancements. However, for the less-power-constrained desktop processor market -- particularly for more CPU-intensive tasks such as gaming -- these improvements (which will ultimately manifest themselves as slightly higher frequencies) are probably going to be underwhelming. If this were the best that Intel could do given the circumstances, then the company could get a pass. But it wasn't -- not by a long shot. Intel could have introduced higher-core-count models Next year, Intel is expected to release a processor family known as Coffee Lake for desktops. This, too, will be built on an enhanced 14-nanometer process (likely further enhanced from the 14-nanometer+ tech used to build the Kaby Lake processors), but with a couple of twists: Rather than recycle the same Skylake processor core again, Intel will be doing an implementation of its mildly enhanced version of Skylake, known as Cannon Lake, in that 14-nanometer process. Intel is expected to boost the processor core count in the top desktop Coffee Lake parts from four to six. The move to the Cannon Lake architecture should yield a roughly 5% improvement in performance at similar frequencies, but the real big bang (at the very least, from a marketing/public perception perspective) should be in the increase in maximum core count from four to six. Although it's nice that Intel is doing this with Coffee Lake, the company could have -- and should have -- introduced higher core counts with the imminent Kaby Lake processors. The additional cores at the top of the product stack would have allowed Intel to increase the core/thread counts across its desktop product stack, potentially spurring upgrade activity (particularly among gamers and PC enthusiasts). Why didn't Intel build six core Kaby Lake processors? Although I don't agree with Intel's decision to hold off on a six-core desktop/high-performance notebook processor until the first half of 2018, there must have been some rationale behind this decision. An obvious explanation that comes to mind is simply cost structure. If Intel decided to, say, replace quad-core parts with hex-core parts, and dual-core parts with quad-core parts across the product stack, then the average silicon die size would go up across the board. The increase in die size (which would drive an increase in product manufacturing costs) could lead to lower product margins if the company simply winds up selling more features/silicon at the same price points as before. However, what Intel could have done is to introduced a hex-core part as a sort of premium desktop chip that sits on top of the fastest quad-core in the company's product stack. Intel could conceivably charge even more for such a part, not only alleviating the potential cost structure problem (the more-expensive-to-build chip would simply be more expensive), but potentially boosting its product average selling prices. Another potential explanation, then, is that Intel simply didn't want to dedicate the engineering resources to building a separate hex-core chip for this market until recently. Given Intel's gargantuan research-and-development budget, this explanation might not seem likely. However, since the previous general manager of Intel's client computing group outright admitted that Intel skipped out on doing an entire generation of desktop processors to save some research and development dollars (something that, to this day, blows my mind), anything is possible.

October 27 AAPL: 114.48 -1.11 Comparison: Here’s how Apple’s current MacBook lineup looks in terms of specs & price Chance Miller - 3 weeks ago @ChanceHMiller Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit After what felt like an incredibly long wait, Apple today officially unveiled its new MacBook lineup. While Apple was once known for simplicity, its latest MacBook lineup is just a tad confusing. In addition to new MacBook Pros with the oft-rumored Touch Bar, Apple also introduced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro and killed off the 11-inch model of the MacBook Air. Head below as we breakdown price points, specs, and more across Apple’s MacBook lineup… MacBook Air As expected, Apple today officially killed the 11-inch MacBook Air model. This means that, to get your foot in the door with a MacBook, your cheapest option is the entry-level MacBook Air, which comes in at $999. Here’s how the models breakdown: Size:  2.96 pounds .68 inches thick at thicket point Display 13.3-inch 1440 x 900 One 3840 x 2160 external display $999 MacBook Air 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz Intel HD Graphics 6000 8GB memory 128GB PCIe-based flash storage $1199 MacBook Air 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz Intel HD Graphics 6000 8GB memory 256GB PCIe-based flash storage Build-to-order upgrades: +$150 for bump to 2.2GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor (either tier) +$200 for increase to 512GB storage ($1199 tier only) This means that the cheapest MacBook on the market is now the 13-inch MacBook Air. Previously, you could get an 11-inch MacBook Air for $899. Entry level price – $999 Max-out price – $1549 12-inch MacBook Apple’s 12-inch MacBook went untouched during today’s event, which was to be expected seeing that it was updated already earlier this year. Nevertheless, the models start at $1299: Size:  2.03 pounds .51 inches thick at thickest point Display 12-inch 2304 x 1440 Supports one 3840 x 2160 external display at 30Hz $1299 MacBook  256GB PCIe-based onboard flash storage1 1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor Turbo Boost up to 2.2GHz 8GB memory Intel HD Graphics 515 $1599 MacBook 512GB PCIe-based onboard flash storage1 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m5 processor Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz 8GB memory Intel HD Graphics 515 Apple’s 12-inch MacBook lineup is relatively simple in comparison to its others, but you’re still paying a premium for that ultra-slim design. Some have questioned that the new 13-inch MacBook Pro might be a better and more reasonable option… 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Somewhat interestingly, Apple is offering a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the new, slimmer design but without the Touch Bar technology. Presumably, Apple is doing this in order to offer budget-focused customers a somewhat more affordable machine that still offers modern specs. Size 3.02 pounds .59-inches thick Display 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 Supports one 5K external display or two simultaneous 4K internal displays $1499 MacBook Pro 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz 8GB 1866MHz memory 256GB PCIe-based SSD Intel Iris Graphics 540 Backlit Keyboard (English) & User’s Guide Two Thunderbolt 3 ports Build-to-order upgrades + $300 for 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz + $200 for 16GB RAM + $200 for 512GB SSD or $600 for 1TB SSD The 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar offers a more affordable option for budget-focused consumers, but it can get pricey quickly depending on the upgrades you make. Entry level price: $1499 Max-out price: $2599 13-inch MacBook Pro (2015) Sticking around is the last-generation MacBook Pro at its same price point. This model offers the most affordable way to get a MacBook with the “Pro” moniker. $1299 MacBook Pro 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz 8GB 1866MHz memory 128GB PCIe-based SSD Intel Iris Graphics 6100 Backlit Keyboard (English) & User’s Guide Two Thunderbolt 2 ports Build-to-order upgrades + $100 for 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz + $200 for 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz + $200 for 16GB of RAM + $200 for 256GB SSD + $400 for 512GB SSD + $800 for 1TB SSD Like most of the Mac lineup, the price gets more pricey as you add more specs… Entry level price – $1299 Max out price – $2599 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar The star of the show is without a doubt the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar. The Touch Bar replaces the transitional function row keys in favor of a new touchscreen that displays commonly used quick actions. Apple’s MacBook Pros are pricier than last time, though, so you’re certainly paying for that Touch Bar: Size 3.02 pounds .59-inches thick Display 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 Supports one 5K external display or two simultaneous 4K internal displays $1799 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 8GB 2133MHz memory 256GB PCIe-based SSD1 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Four Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID Build-to-order upgrades + $100 for 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz + $200 for 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz + $200 for 16GB RAM $1999 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 8GB 2133MHz memory 512GB PCIe-based SSD Intel Iris Graphics 550 Backlit Keyboard (English) & User’s Guide Four Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID Build-to-order upgrades + $100 for 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz + $200 for 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz + $200 for 16GB RAM + $400 for 1TB SSD You’re certainly paying for the Touch Bar and for storage with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but it packs a lot of punch for its size and is Apple’s most powerful 13-inch option. Entry level price: $1799 Max-out price: $2899 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar The 15-inch MacBook Pro is the same story as the 13-inch model, but its larger size gets you dedicated graphics and more power overall, but also a higher price. Size 4.02 pounds .61 inches thick Display 15.4-inch 2880 x 1800 display Supports up to two 5K displays simultaneously or four 4K displays $2399 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 16GB 2133MHz memory 256GB PCIe-based SSD1 Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB memory Four Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID Build-to-order upgrades: + $300 for 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz + $200 for 512GB SSD + $600 for 1TB SSD + $1400 for 2TB SSD + $200 for Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory $2799 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 16GB 2133MHz memory 512GB PCIe-based SSD1 Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB memory Four Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID Build-to-order upgrades: + $200 for 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz + $400 for 1TB SSD + $1200 for 2TB SSD + $100 for Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory The 15-inch MacBook Pro quickly becomes one of the most powerful laptops you can get on the market, but as you can see, it also quickly becomes one of the most expensive laptops on the market. Entry level price: $2399 Max-out price: $4299 Wrap up Apple’s new MacBook lineup is certainly more complex than it has been in a while, but there seems to be something that pleases everyone. Unless, of course, you’re looking for a machine under $1000, which is only available in the 13-inch MacBook Air at this point. Nevertheless, the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros take design cues from the 12-inch model, add the Touch Bar, and add some serious power on the inside. It gets pricey fast, but you get a decent amount of power for that price. What MacBook did you buy today? Let us know in our poll here.

I have been spending a lot of hours already on the web and I feel like I am almost as clueless as I was when starting. So here is my situation : I have been using this old system for years : Intel Core2 Duo CPU (a desktop one) Gigabyte ATX Motherboard GA-P35C-DS3R Gigabyte nVida GTX470 1GB Two [2x 1 GB] DDR II PC2-6400 800MHz (Kingston & G-Skill) It was enough for my usage and I am not wealthy so I can't really upgrade often. But since roughly 6 months, I was getting BSOD every day, getting worse and worse with time. The cause was faulty SATA controllers (been switching SSD/HDD, cables... checking drivers, well ..definitely a hardware issue). So much I really had to change at least the couple CPU/MB. My brother gave me 2 parts to help : Point Of View nVidia GTX 580 1.5GB [3x 2GB] DD3-1600 PC3-12800 G-Skill Pi Series (a tri-channel i7-designed memory type, somewhat deprecated now if I understood well) When looking for cheap cards / CPU on which I could use these memories, I ran into an annoying fact. Most of the motherboards are now micro-ATX. Buying an ATX (and the choice is reduced to 1 or 2 model only on e-Shopping sites) is actually more expensive. I thought I was forced to do that nonetheless since I have an old ATX case, but after a little research, the holes in it allow to install a micro-ATX as well. But about the huge graphic card... (yes, it's HUGE) I was quite suspicious if I could even stick it in, with all the hard drives and what not. Then about the CPU, Intel was out of question, prices are way too high for me. So I turned to AMD... and discovered about those APU things with integrated powerful graphic capabilities. This would definitely be a good answer to my space issue and watching the web it could run games like Battlefield 4 without any discrete graphic card added and with good results. Well, it doesn't even matter for me, I'm used to play with crappy graphics and framerate and since I am playing only 2 games I just wanted those to work and that's it. One of them being Skyrim and there's also a video demonstrating how the AMD APU performs. So this is what I bought (yes I know it's old already but when you don't have the money you have to cope with it) : AMD APU A10-7850K ASUS-A88XM-E-USB3.1 I was and I am still using Windows 7x64 Ultimate. All this is installed and I have used 2 of the 3 RAM sticks in it (since there are 2 slots only). All drivers installed and well, the system is up and running, no more BSODs (thank god). So what are my concerns ? Well, first I was used to have a nVidia control panel in my display properties where I could set up 3D settings, colors (desktop / videos) and stuff like that... I thought I would have access to that the same way with Catalyst Control Center, which is (just found out) now renamed AMD Radeon Software Crimson. The fact is, it is not there. Nowhere, I have tried using the AMD "autodetectutility" to install the correct drivers/software for my AMD APU, and I also downloaded the 296 Mb file manually and... ok it installs drivers and all this stuff is working but that control center software isn't installed at all. Is this normal ? do I have to install a discrete AMD Card to get access to this ? Next concern is about the performance, to be honest when I'm launching Skyrim, I barely see any difference in performances compared to my old rig, in fact I even feel that it was better before. The game is fine visually and playable but FPS are somewhat crappy (idk, 15-20), and there are some short freeze (less than a second) every now and then. So here are my next questions, what do you think is the cause ? (it's installed on the SSD, as before, it can't really be some slow I/O issue as if it was on a HDD) Are the memories in question ? I was using 4GB (2 pairs of dual 1GB at 800Mhz sticks) and there was 1GB on the card and now it's 4GB too but just a pair of 2GB at 1600Mhz sticks (that I'm not sure works as "dual" since it was "tri" designed) but no VRAM anymore... and it seemed to perform better before. I searched a bit (hours) and learned about that shared memory stuff so I also tried allocating 512MB in the BIOS for the APU Graphic part...didn't help. Finally, I wasn't sure before buying (this is why my choice went to this APU) but I feel like I have enough room to install the GTX580 (didn't try yet, my system is ok now, don't wanna mess up before getting more infos). It's not a compatible Radeon with the A10 APU so I won't be able to enable dual graphics (Crossfire I think it's named). But looking at this article, it should still performs better with than without. I'm still puzzled though. It looks like it works only if the software / game is able to use both computing powers, and I am afraid that they're aren't many, typically an old game like Skyrim. Would it still use the 8 graphic cores for normal computing or leave that totally unused and sleeping (thus meaning I would have wasted money for something I am not using) ? This was a bit long but I prefered giving in-depth details to ensure I am being understood well enough. Thanks for your time, I hope that you will be able to enligthen me on all this !

I used to have an A10 6800K black edition and tested with low and high end graphics cards all game where mostly playable using the A10 6800K black edition APU and graphic's card. I know what it can be like when your on a tight budget, sucks but ya just have make the best of what you have. this should give you some idea of the limits of the CPU side of your apu when put with an graphics card http://www.3dmark.com/compare/3dm11/.../3dm11/8141523 ahh I just realise the i7 is in crossfire I see if have one with i7 and crossfire off so you can see the difference in cpu and same gfx card. use this one to compare http://www.3dmark.com/compare/3dm11/.../3dm11/8030764 pay attention to the physics and combined they will give you an idea of in game difference in cpu performance Last edited by stevevnicks; 10-29-2016 at 15:27.     stevevnicks View Public Profile Find all posts by stevevnicks   (#3) Spartan Master Guru     Videocard: R9 290 PCS+ Processor: i5 4690K @ 4.3Ghz / H80i Mainboard: ASUS Z97-PRO GAMER Memory: 2x8GB HyperXFury 2133Mhz Soundcard: PSU: Corsair CS750M 10-29-2016, 15:39 | posts: 569 | Location: United Kingdom AMD APUs are for 720/768/1080p low-mid settings gaming, aren't they? 4GB RAM is not so much nowadays, but you can download CPU-Z and check the Memory tab about Channels/DRAM Frequency.     Spartan View Public Profile Find all posts by Spartan   (#4) stevevnicks Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI R9 390X Gaming Processor: i7 4770 Mainboard: ROG Maximus Hero VI Memory: 16g Corsair 1866 vengence Soundcard: Blaster Z PSU: Corsair RM850 10-29-2016, 16:07 | posts: 1,326 | Location: Suffolk Quote: Originally Posted by Spartan AMD APUs are for 720/768/1080p low-mid settings gaming, aren't they? 4GB RAM is not so much nowadays, but you can download CPU-Z and check the Memory tab about Channels/DRAM Frequency. yeah I would say low settings for all demanding games, older games you can get away with mid to high if your system has min off 1866 ram that was with an 6800K and it's built in gpu, so the 7850 should be better than the 6800 with fast system ram, still its never going to be a real gaming pc with modern games, he will need something like an rx470 at the most, the 7850 probs wont benefit from bigger gfx cards, because it will probs hold faster gfx card back .. this just my guess from messing around with an 6800k apu and different gfx cards. the 6800k apu's cpu's were basicly peaked out with an GTX760 or an HD7870 from my findings any gfx faster was more or less a waste of money with game where cpu played a big part or online gaming, maybe because with online gaming it's a bit more heavy on the cpu part, at a guess.

Did you reinstall your Windows after the mobo-apu upgrade? If not, perhaps give it a try. 2. Not sure which driver did you install, but I think this is the last one for your APU: http://support.amd.com/en-us/downloa...Windows+7+-+64 3. Try DDU as well: http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/...-download.html 4. Since you mentioned FPS I guess you have OSD, you should check cpu usage and temp (maybe thermal throttling?). 5. Is it a heavily modded Skyrim? Because I'm not sure if an APU and 4GB RAM is enough for that. 6. How old is your PSU? 7. Try that GTX580.     Spartan View Public Profile Find all posts by Spartan   (#6) Dch48 Maha Guru   Videocard: Sapphire Nitro+ RX 470 4g Processor: AMD FX-6300 6 core Mainboard: Gigabyte GA-78LMT-S2 Memory: Corsair XMS DDR3-1333 8gb Soundcard: Realtek 7.1 integrated PSU: LEPA 650 watt 10-30-2016, 02:38 | posts: 1,533 | Location: Upstate NY It should do better in Skyrim. My HP laptop with a first generation A8-3500M APU and 1333 DDR3 memory gets 38-55 fps on a mix of Medium and High settings, mostly Medium. Average fps is about 42. Shadow settings need to be low. The graphics are the built in ones and the game has no mods. For the Crimson settings, right click on the desktop and see if the first item listed is Radeon settings. If that isn't present, then the drivers are not installed correctly. However, Crimson drivers are not the recommended ones. Catalyst 15.7.1 is the recommended driver with an option of Crimson 16.2.1. Your graphics are considered legacy now by AMD. I'm using the Crimson 16.2.1 on my laptop and they work well. http://support.amd.com/en-us/downloa...s%207%20-%2064 Last edited by Dch48; 10-30-2016 at 03:03.     Dch48 View Public Profile Find all posts by Dch48   (#7) dom38fr Newbie   Videocard: none Processor: AMD A10-7850K Mainboard: ASUS-A88XM-E-USB3.1 Memory: DDR3 1600 / [2x 2GB] Soundcard: none PSU: 700W 11-03-2016, 17:58 | posts: 14 | Location: FR Hello and thanks everyone for answering, I had read but didn't answer yet as I was waiting for more point of views coming. Steve, I know a powerful discrete card would be great and I know APU won't give me a Gaming PC, I just wanted it to run an old game like Skyrim and that's it, well enough for my needs (& budget). Spartan, yeah, expanding my RAM size was I think necessary, as I had 4 before, and 4 today... but without the 1Gb on the videocard and that was a 20% difference, even if it was a newer one and faster one. I did not reinstall my system, wasn't necessary imo. At first I am 100% sure I installed the drivers that the autodetect utility gave me.. then, since the control center wasn't anywhere, I tried the most recent drivers, a non-WHQL Package, which I just now found out, didn't contain at all the control center (named "Radeon Settings").. I ended up restarting the installer from the 296MB file on the page you linked and found the software finally ! The CPU temperature and usage are correct, my PSU is 2 years old I think, maybe 3. And trying the GTX 580 was a fail, as I had to dig & remove lots of stuff (drives, cables,..) ... all this to realise I couldn't even plug the power supply, well, pins were missing, it needs a 8-pin + 6 pin connector and my PSU only got 2x 6 pins PCI-E .. apparently there are some adaptors but that would be a waste in my opinion. My game is heavily modded, I guess I will have to tune it up again so that it's playable enough to my taste. But at least I didn't want any freeze or weird artefact (similar to Vertical Sync issue but ..vertical and not horizontal) ...that I didn't have with my old rig. Dch48, as I just wrote, now I do have the Radeon Settings, finally. But your comment is still interesting, since what installed is : WHQL-Win7-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-16.9.2-Sep29 and you're telling me that they are not recommended, that I should get Catalyst 15.7.1 ... or Crimson 16.2.1, and both are old... so I'm wondering if it's a good idea or not. Finally, after more hours looking for infos on the web, I found out that APU performance was heavily linked with RAM speed (freq, timings). There's even a video demonstrating this. So I had no choice but to buy RAM sticks as well, 2133MHz because it's the sweet spot for it. (and 2400, though raising the perfs a little, was apparently causing some troubles here and there, especially on MB similar to mine) So I bought 2x 4 GB of PC-17000, and I didn't extensively test but I saw instantly that micro-freeze were gone (and I had another small game in which I could see this as well). So this is definitely an improvement. Thanks everyone.

The drivers I posted are the last ones recommended for non-GCN graphics cards (or APU's). Anything newer is optimized for GCN level cards and probably will not give any improvement on the older hardware. They might even be a downgrade performance wise. Will the newer drivers work? Probably, but they might not be as suitable as the older ones. From what I could find on your APU it has HD8000D series graphics which are non-GCN and classed as legacy. My laptop has HD6620G and is definitely legacy. Yes APU performance is heavily dependent on system RAM speed and it has to be in dual channel mode for the best results. Unfortunately, my laptop only supports up to 1333 RAM and I'm not sure it even runs in Dual channel. Some utilities say yes and some don't. From the performance I get, I think it does.

Going back to your original post I see you said 7850 so yes, you do have the recommended driver. The only problem with the newer APU's is that they will throttle back performance when high temperatues are reached more than the older ones did. My first generation Llano APU doesn't do it at all. So, if your APU is hitting a high enough temperature under load, that could explain the performance issues you reported. From the web it seems that throttling is a known issue with the A10-7850K. The consensus is that it throttles when the GPU part is under load (as in gaming) and the temperature approaches 55C. 55C is not that hot since my laptop will run at 65C all day without any loss in performance and most discrete video cards can stand up to 95C. People seem to think that the stock cooler on the 7850K is insufficient and it needs an aftermarket replacement.

In this mission, we will try to stop the IMC from taking the ARC- Fold Weapon away from Planet Typhon by directly attacking them head on. So without any further ado, let's begin with the IMC vs Militia War. Trial by Fire Walkthrough Commander Sarah Briggs has scanned our data and this helped us to track the energy signal to an IMC Base on Typhon. Commander has also agreed to BT and kept you as his Permanent Pilot. So let's show her how we can handle the titan and take down the IMC Titans. If you've played the Multiplayer then this War will be a piece of cake for you. Starting from breaking the wall and facing off the first wave of the IMC titans. Note: Keep One pattern Kill the Titan and Collect batteries Make use of the Loadout you are comfortable with and then down the Titans. There will be all types of Titans out there (expect Legion). Keep a distance from Northstar and Ronin as they are pretty quick with their moves. Rest all depends on your gameplay style. Sarah will then lead you to the second wave where you get the Loadout - Northstar. So the best way to try your loadout is against the Titans that will be 2x difficult to take down so you need to find cover and more batteries. Reach the Arc Moving Further to Draconis ship we will have dozens of Reapers blocking our way so try to use the Scorch Loadout to lock and fire them all at once. Take the final wave of Enemy Titans and make it quick before the Draconis take's off. After defeating the Titans, it's time to go Airbourne and try to stop the Draconis from taking away the Arc - Fold Weapon. Thus completing the walkthrough, but we will continue to our next chapter The Arc and Defeat Viper or check our Titanfall 2 Wiki guide to know more about guides, collectible locations, tips, tricks, and cheats.

The Blocker Bugs So Far For Mesa 13.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 29 October 2016 at 08:10 AM EDT. 14 Comments Mesa release manager Emil Velikov has setup a tracker bug to indicate all of the bugs that are blockers for the upcoming Mesa 13.0 release. Mesa 13.0 was branched earlier this month with a plan for weekly release candidates until it's ready to make its debut. Mesa 13.0 is still anticipated for release in early-to-mid November. This is a big update with OpenGL 4.5 support for Intel, GL 4.4/4.5 extension completion for Nouveau NVC0/RadeonSI (but only officially showing OpenGL 4.3 compliance), RADV Radeon Vulkan driver, and many other changes. Obviously with all of the work the past few months, Mesa 13.0 isn't without some regressions. Current nasty bugs/regressions being tracked are the build breaking if linking against non-standard prefixed LLVM, the build running into problems against particular versions of Flex, a few Intel-specific driver bugs, a GLSL test regressions, a swrast Piglit regression, and a Softpipe Piglit regression. It's possible other blocker bugs will get added too as testing continues and this tracker bug was just made on Friday. Bug details on FreeDesktop.org. 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Call it an iPad Super-Pro or whatever you want, there's a gap in the lineup. Sarah Tew/CNET Deny it all you want, Apple, but Macs and iPads need to fuse 0 Share: Computers by Scott Stein October 29, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jetscott Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? The first time I saw the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops, I thought: hey, there's a little strip of an iPad grafted onto that Mac. Macs don't have touch. At this point, they're the outliers in the computing world. Windows and Chrome touch computers have flooded the world for years, now. There are tablets. There are phones. There are, well, the iPad and iPhone. Apple says that the Mac and iPad probably won't combine, and that a hybrid touchscreen laptop computer isn't in the company's current plans. Instead, it seems, we have the Touch Bar. The idea of Mac computers not having touchscreens is now so odd that my wife was surprised when I told her. No, she doesn't follow tech. But she hasn't used a Mac in years, either. Apple's new MacBooks Does the Mac still matter? The Mac and iPad aren't merging, get over it The new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar I like the idea of a Touch Bar, or at least having a more customizable keyboard and second-screen controls. I haven't used one yet. And my colleague Dan Ackerman was impressed with his brief hands-on demo of the tech earlier this week. All in all, it seems like a useful way to evolve keyboard interfaces. But the Touch Bar is small. And the Touch Bar isn't a full touch interface like a touchscreen. It feels like Apple's just dipped its toes into touch on the Mac, instead of exploring the full range of what could be. Like, for instance, what you can do on an iPad. That's what makes Apple's statement that the Mac and iPad will never meet even more curious. Maybe they won't. But I bet that hybrid still happens. In fact, it's already happening. And until a new iOS super-device -- or, maybe, a post-iOS super-device -- emerges to take the Mac's place, I'm not thrilled with the divide at all. Pencil support, anyone?Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Hi, meet the iPad I've used iPads to do work. I've tried to make them do everything. I'm writing this story on an iPad Pro, and a MacBook. I alternate. The iPad is something that's so close to a full computer, even Tim Cook beckons us to make the switch. But it's still not fully there. It does around 70 percent of what I need. The rest, due mainly to OS design and some software and hardware limitations, is a challenge. Apple's software engineering chief tells us why there's no touchscreen Mac Craig Federighi discusses the thinking behind the Touch Bar, describes the challenges of adding Touch ID - and reveals that Apple had built several touchscreen prototypes. by Connie Guglielmo 5:21 Close Drag We're well past the time when a touchscreen of any sort should be considered cool. It's standard issue. From here on in, it's all about touch as a tool. Apple's iPad tablets and Windows PCs are useful because their entire canvas can be versatile. You can touch. Or, you can not. Sliders or palettes can be anywhere. Microsoft is already pushing into something different: tools that interact with touch. Microsoft's new Surface Dial, a haptic metal wheel that rests on Windows displays to create an instant pop-up interface, feels like an augmented expansion of the touchscreen. Gimmicky? Maybe. But when everything's touchable, controls can be anywhere. Compare that to the Touch Bar, which is one strip, one place. Do I think the Mac is going touch in the future? Maybe not. But I think Apple's already got the pieces to the puzzle of touch-screen computing lying right in front of us. The Touch Bar is the start of bringing some form of a touchscreen to the Mac.Photo by James Martin/CNET Why Apple's probably waiting The iOS and MacOS operating systems remain separate beasts, year after year. I think I know why. Apple effectively makes its own chips for iOS devices. (They are manufactured by companies such as TSMC, but custom-designed by Apple.) And they're getting more powerful every year. Good enough to replace the Intel chips used in a power professional Mac? Not yet. But there's already some anecdotal evidence that they're getting awfully close. One benchmark, as highlighted recently by Apple pundit John Gruber, suggests that the iPhone 7's A10 processor can go toe-to-toe with the Intel CPU found in the 2013 MacBook Air. Whether the comparison is 100 percent accurate or not is almost besides the point. In the next few years, Apple's "mobile" chips look to be on target to meet or exceed Intel's computer CPUs in terms of raw processing power. At that point, the only thing holding back an iPad is software and accessories. And Apple actually is positioning it as a full-fledged Mac replacement. A future, more powerful hybrid computer with Apple's own processors could mean more flexibility in design. Or it could mean Apple controls the future of its product even more. The future of magic do-it-all tablets is already here...let it happen As Apple's Craig Federighi said regarding iPads and Macs, "To attempt to bend one into the other is at its root to make a compromise." Fair enough. While a touch-based Mac is easy enough to envision from a hardware perspective, bringing its cursor-based interface along for the ride could indeed be a bridge too far. Windows did a few years ago, but at a great expense: remember the rough years of user discontent that was Windows 8. But those "compromises" Federighi aims to avoid are already happening on the Mac, to some degree. Some people have already grumbled about the disappearance of MagSafe, or the shift to USB-C type ports that will require more dongles for now. And there's skepticism about the Touch Bar. After all, it requires app support. The iPhone's 3D Touch has taken a while to develop meaningful uses across iOS 10, and many third-party apps I use were slow to support it. Will Touch Bar be better? Change is perpetual. I read Apple's executive comments on the Mac and how it would weaken with touch, and how the iPad shouldn't necessarily be like a Mac, and I thought...regular people can't afford two expensive, large-screen devices with an increasingly large functional overlap. I bought a laptop last year because my previous one was eight years old, and no iPad has the software underpinnings to replace the needs I have. But, I bought it for utility. Meanwhile, iOS is the touch-friendly landscape. It's also where Apple's next-gen creative tools lie, like Pencil. But you know what? Apple can converge the two. It should. My son recently had a birthday party where he and his friends played Minecraft. They gathered around touch laptops, touched the screens and had fun. They know how to use them because that's what they do: use touchscreens. The iPad can be a utility device too. And if the iPad Pro can have a keyboard and a stylus, it can have a lot more. If the Mac won't evolve to accept touchscreens, then bring on the advanced iOS hardware...because my kids, and the rest of the world, are waiting. I don't care what they're called.

The new entity will be able to address thousands of devices and the combined expertise of both companies will be particularly important for automotive, mobile and IoT industries, which are poised for growth. The combined company will be one of the world’s largest suppliers of semiconductors in general, with revenues comparable to those of Samsung and Intel. However, it is not going to be easy to combine the assets of Qualcomm and NXP under one company. The Biggest Semiconductor Transaction Ever Qualcomm intends to pay $110 for every NXP share, or for $37.88 billion (according to estimates by Reuters, based on the company’s 344.4 million diluted shares as of early October), which represents around 10% premium compared to the stock price of around $98.66 at close on Wednesday. When NXP’s debt is included, the enterprise value goes up to around $47 billion in total. Last week several media outlets reported that the NXP management wanted to get $120 per share, but agreed to $110 proposed by Qualcomm. In fact, given that the NXPI stock was trading in the range between $61.61 and $107.54 in the last 12 months, $110 seems to be a rather fair price. Qualcomm headquarters. Photo by Coolcaesar at en.wikipedia What is interesting is that Qualcomm intends to buy NXP in an all-cash deal, which means that the company will have to borrow money, as it has around $17 billion in cash and other short-term assets its pockets today (according to U.S. regulators). Even adding in long-term securities only brings Qualcomm's piggy bank to around $30 billion in total. Qualcomm’s total debt as of today is $11.77 billion and with a new multi-billion loan (or loans) as well as NXP’s debt, its total debt will be well over $20 billion. The company does not reveal the names of its creditors right now, but it admits that it will have to borrow money to pay to NXP shareholders as well as liabilities of the company eventually. Qualcomm and NXP intend to close the deal by the end of calendar 2017, after regulators in various jurisdictions approve the buyout. What is noteworthy is that the two companies are starting their integration effort today, well before they get all the approvals they need, which shows their confidence in the deal closing, and confirms that it will not be easy to merge the two multi-billion corporations. If everything goes as planned, the transaction valued at approximately $47 billion will be the largest semiconductor takeover ever. Last year Avago paid $37 billion for Broadcom and earlier this year Softbank bought ARM for $32 billion. From an economics points of view, large chip-related acquisitions in the recent years are not surprising. Electronics get more complex and more expensive to develop. As a result, semiconductor companies need to expand their businesses to gain access to and volume in various existing and emerging devices. Moreover, by taking over other companies, chip developers not only get IP they need, but can also cut down certain costs and/or get rid of competitors. Finally, as companies get bigger, it gets easier for them to negotiate with their suppliers because now they need to get more goods or services. Qualcomm and NXP: More Than the Sum of All Parts? Qualcomm will create a rather formidable force in the semiconductor world by combining two very different companies with 72,000 employees in total. However, the giant machine that Qualcomm and NXP are going to create may be worth more than the sum of their capitalizations if everything goes according to plan. Right now Qualcomm is the world’s largest supplier of SoCs for mobile devices and telecom equipment. Last fiscal year the company earned $25 billion in revenue: $17B from selling chips and $8B from technology licensing. In the recent years Qualcomm has been trying to diversify its business and offered various solutions for automotive, IoT, healthcare and even datacenter industries. While the company has been gradually expanding its product portfolio with various solutions, mobile SoCs has remained its bread and butter for products sold. Moreover, some of the markets and products categories hard to break into due factors such as conservative approach of manufacturers, very long development cycles, etc. For example, despite of having CPU, GPU, sensors and other IP, Qualcomm has never made into Top 10 suppliers of automotive semiconductors (according to IHS). By contrast, NXP has been focusing on mixed-signal semiconductors as well as various specialized microprocessors and microcontrollers. NXPs chips are used inside automobiles, in healthcare equipment, NFC equipment (in fact, NXP was one of the inventors of the technology) and in hundreds of other devices. Based on data from IHS, NXP earned $9.72 billion in revenue last year. While Qualcomm and NXP overlap in certain areas, they aren't direct rivals in any significant sense of the word; the sum of their revenues come from different markets. Therefore, the acquisition will be complementary for Qualcomm because it greatly expands its addressable markets (potentially up to $138 billion in 2020) and brings thousands of new clients (Qualcomm says that NXP serves 25K direct and indirect customers). The combined company will have revenue of well over $30 billion and will be the world’s No. 3 supplier of semiconductors after Intel ($51 billion in 2015) and Samsung ($40 billion), based on rankings from IHS. Keep in mind that Samsung sells tons of commodity DRAM and NAND flash memory, whereas the new Qualcomm will specialize on various general purpose, automotive, IoT and special purpose computing solutions. In fact, the new Qualcomm will be a rather unique company with no direct rivals of comparable sizes, as companies like Avago (together with Broadcom), MediaTek, Texas Instruments, Renesas and other earn considerably less. During the conference call with investors and financial analysts, the management of Qualcomm and NXP emphasized multiple times that the new company will not only be able to develop unique solutions thanks to massive amount of IP available to leverage (some of which goes back to semi IP from Motorola and Philips), but will be able to address automotive and IoT industries better than its competitors. In the best case scenario, Qualcomm will be able to offer highly-integrated platforms for hundreds of emerging devices from smart wearables to 5G-enabled IoT equipment to self-driving automobiles with wireless charging, in addition to more advanced platforms for hardware we use today, such as smartphones, routers or servers. At the same time, while the management teams accentuate that the transaction is not about cutting costs or synergies, it is inevitable that there will be redundancies and optimizations. Therefore, some existing projects are expected to be cancelled (it will be interesting to see what happens to Freescale’s CPUs, for example) and some will be merged. Qualcomm predicts that two years after the two firms merge, the new company will save at least $500 million annually. The Road Ahead The acquisition of NXP clearly makes a lot of sense for Qualcomm, but the integration of the two companies is not going to be easy. Firstly, NXP is still integrating Freescale Semiconductor (the deal closed last December). Secondly, NXP has its own semiconductor fabs (all of which are outdated and Qualcomm has never had its own fabs). Thirdly, NXP has more employees than Qualcomm itself (45K vs 27K). Finally, the new company will have to remain very agile to remain competitive on rapidly developing markets, such as smartphones. Executives of Qualcomm said on Thursday that the combined company would be managed by execs from both firms, who know how certain businesses work. For example, Qualcomm plans to use NXP’s sales teams to sell Qualcomm-branded devices for IoT because these people know the market and know how to address it. In the meantime, Qualcomm does not have immediate plans to get rid of NXP's semiconductor production facilities and NXP’s execs will continue to manage them. But in longer term, the company may reconsider its approach to manufacturing as Qualcomm has long based its business around being a fabless semiconductor. Overall, while the integration efforts are underway, there are things that may change between now and late 2017, when the deal is expected to close. Therefore, only time will tell how the combined company will look like and how it will be managed. No matter how optimistic execs from Qualcomm and NXP sound today about the prospects of the merged company, it will be a very tough job to blend the two firms. Nevertheless, the importance of connected devices will only grow in the coming years (one may call it the 5G era) and therefore having the whole package of IP needed to build different kinds of devices (from water quality sensors to smart cars and smart buildings) is clearly important.

Reply witeken - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Also, in the discussion of why their is so much M&A in 2015-6, you forgot the most important thing: the semiconductor market is slowing down, so M&A is just another way for companies to deliver value to the shareholders. Reply Mondozai - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link The semiconductor market is only entering a lull as the smartphone growth phase is coming to a close. This deal is positioned for the next phase, which is the IoT era. Therefore, it is incorrect to paint this as a purely defensive move to shareholders. It's about positioning it for the next growth stage. Whether it will succeed or not is anyone's guess, but the stated intention of the deal and underlying logic is sound. Reply ddriver - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link The bubble keeps growing, it would have taken qualcomm 1/10 of that to develop an analog to nxp's entire product like from scratch. Wouldn't want to be there when it finally bursts. I guess they are doing it for the patents rather than the actual technology, as in it would be cheaper to take over rather than pay royalties. Reply Wwhat - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link There is a difference between slowing down and growth slowing down. The first means a trend downwards, the second is just saturation. Reply emn13 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link According to this article, Intel's revenues are 51B, and the meged companies revenues are 35B. Intel does not earn 2x 35B, as you suggest. Personally, I doubt that a 35B vs. 51B revenue matters all that much when it comes to where a company is going, so I'd call those comparable (I'd call a 2x difference comparable too). With the right sales channels, tech, IP etc. a 35B company might easily out-compete a 51B company (and the reverse is obviously true too). Reply Lolimaster - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link So in the near future we will see Qualcomm branded smartphones. Reply ddriver - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link nxp's product line is "lower level" compared to qualcomm, they mostly make micro-controllers, that won't really be bringing qualcomm any closer to smartphones, they are already as close as it gets having numerous complete SOCs with integrated modems in their portfolio. Reply Gondalf - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link Hopefully this merger will goes well. Npx is not in a good siuation and sure is not growing, Qualcomm is shrinking with a semiconductor revenue of only 16B, the rest is patents revenue. So yes the agglomeration is exactly half Intel and a lot less than Samsung Semicondutors. In my mind they paid too much for Npx, epecially they don't have a good FAB to offer, but only little 200mm FABs to be shut down in a short time due obsolescence. Anyway Qualcomm knows that its revenue is going down year after year cause Mediatek and many other companies so this could be a manner to stay alive with a good revenue. Reply emn13 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link NXP was nearly bankrupt just a few years ago. Accumulating around 100B in value in a few years certainly doesn't sound like they're doing very poorly.

The initiative would levy a 2.5 percent tax on many companies' Oregon sales over $25 million. But Measure 97 exempts some types of businesses and applies differently to others. The measure's backers say Oregon's business taxes are unusually low, and argue Measure 97 would make large companies pay their fair share for state services. Opponents call the initiative a hidden sales tax, and say consumers would end up paying some of the bill. It's a complex, unusual initiative. Here are some answers to the questions we frequently hear about the tax. Are Oregon's business taxes really so low? Yes, at least relatively speaking. Businesses pay 37.6 percent of Oregon's state and local tax revenue, according to estimates by the Council on State Taxation. That compares to 45 percent nationally. As a share of total economic activity in the state, Oregon businesses' tax bills are the lowest in the nation. Those rankings reflect the absence of an Oregon sales tax, which in other states is paid by both consumers and businesses. They also reflect a relatively high personal income tax (which helps compensate for the low business taxes) and Oregon's unusually robust economic output, skewed upward by one extremely large manufacturer: Intel. A May study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office found Measure 97 would move Oregon businesses' share of the state's total tax burden to 45.4 percent, on par with the national average. What happens to the economy if voters raise business taxes? The legislative study found both positive and negative effects. Oregon would still see employment growth, about 145,000 jobs over five years. But without Measure 97, the state could expect more than 165,000 new jobs, the study found. That's the net effect of more public sector jobs and slower growth in private sector jobs. Overall, the study said Measure 97 would be a very modest drag on the economy, slowing growth in income, employment and population. In each case, though, growth under Measure 97 would still be within 1 percent of current forecasts. The study also said additional investment in education could provide a long-term economic boost. What would consumers pay? Unlike a conventional sales tax, paid by shoppers, Measure 97 levies taxes on businesses. Measure 97's authors say the big businesses subject to the tax would absorb the whole cost, insulating consumers. Many others, including Gov. Kate Brown — a Measure 97 supporter — say it's evident businesses would pass on some of their higher costs. Economists say how much businesses pass along would depend on their market power. Cable television companies, for example, may pass along much of the cost. Private utilities such as Portland General Electric have regulated monopolies and a legal right to pass along higher costs – including taxes – to ratepayers. Other states exempt wholesalers from consumption and sales taxes, or they tax wholesale trade at a lower rate. Because Measure 97 does not, some economists expect a "pyramiding" effect in which added costs are stacked atop one another for some products and services. Conventional sales taxes in other states usually exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not. So if businesses do pass along higher costs, it could produce higher grocery bills. The legislative study — which was based on an approximation of Measure 97 — concluded it would both dampen wage growth and raise prices. The effect varies depending on household income: Households making less than $48,000 a year would see a 0.9 percent decrease in after-tax income. For a household making $34,000 to $48,000 a year, that's $563 less. Oregon's annual median household income is roughly $61,000. For families in that range, Measure 97 means $613 less, a 0.8 percent decline in income. The cost would rise in higher income brackets, but the proportion of the impact would decline. For wealthy households, with after-tax income topping $206,000, Measure 97 would cost nearly $1,300 a year – a 0.4 percent hit. Where does the money go? Measure 97 could give lawmakers $6 billion more to spend in Oregon's next two-year budget, growing the state's general fund by a third. The measure says it will fund "public early childhood and kindergarten through twelfth-grade education, healthcare; and, services for senior citizens." Some of the money would go elsewhere, though. The Oregon Legislative Counsel concluded that under Oregon law about $250 million in Measure 97 revenue from gas stations and similar businesses must go to the state Highway Fund. Because Measure 97 isn't a constitutional amendment, the Legislature could spend the money any way it chooses. As a practical matter, though, lawmakers would likely spend most of the money as prescribed. In the current budget, more than three-quarters of state spending goes to education or social services. What about rising public pension costs? How much of Measure 97's revenue would that eat? Some of Measure 97's revenue could help offset a more than $800 million spike in pension costs that followed the Oregon Supreme Court's ruling last year that tossed out prior pension reforms. That's creating a substantial part of the budget deficit Measure 97 would address. Who supports Measure 97? It's an initiative, put on the ballot by public employee unions. They maintain their ballot measure would rectify a tax imbalance in Oregon, in which businesses pay a steadily smaller share of state revenue. The biggest contributors to the "Yes" campaign are public employee unions, especially the teacher's union. The "Yes" campaign has raised more than $12 million. Another union-backed effort, which is supporting Measure 97 and six other ballot measures, has raised more than $1 million this year. Who's against it? Retailers are the biggest contributors to the "No" campaign – Costco, Safeway/Albertsons (the two grocers share an owner) and Fred Meyer. The "No" campaign has raised a little more than $25 million. OK, who would pay the tax? Of roughly 250,000 businesses registered in Oregon in 2013, the legislative study found that 951 would qualify based on their corporate status, sales volume and income. The study concluded the 100 largest taxpayers would pay two-thirds of the burden. Here are some industries with the largest potential tax increases under Measure 97, according to the study: Wholesalers: Their taxes would jump 583 percent, from $102.1 million to $697.3 million. Retailers: Taxes would climb 766 percent, from $69.8 million to $604.8 million. Health care: Taxes would leap 1,211 percent, from $7.9 million to $103.6 million. Within industries, the tax will apply differently to different types of companies. The measure applies to one kind of business (known as a C-corporation) but exempts two others (S-corporations and "benefit companies.") There are many distinctions among the various types of companies, and different tax implications for each corporate status. For our purposes, think of it this way: C-corporations frequently have many investors, like a publicly traded corporation. S-corporations have few owners. Sometimes that's a family-owned business, but it can also be a large business controlled by one person or company. A "benefit company" is a special category of business under Oregon law, established to create public benefits in addition to profits for the owners. Is there a list of which companies would be subject to Measure 97? No. State officials have private tax data that shows the corporate status of each company in the state, but say that information is not subject to the state's public disclosure laws. So except for large, public companies that disclose their corporate status to investors (most all of those are C-corps), there's no way to know for sure. Safeway, for example, initially claimed its corporate status exempts it from Measure 97. Then it reversed itself and said it is subject to the initiative. Because Safeway is a privately held company, there's no way to know for sure which statement is accurate. What about Oregon's biggest companies – Intel, Nike, Precision Castparts and Lithia Motors? All are subject to Measure 97. But it would affect one of them very differently. Measure 97's tax generally applies only to sales that take place within Oregon. So Intel, Nike and Precision Castparts – which sell almost all their products to customers outside the state – will likely pay very little under Measure 97. (The tax could affect Intel indirectly, though, if the equipment companies that supply its Hillsboro factories raise prices.) It's a different story with Lithia, a Medford company that operates a chain of auto dealerships. In its last quarterly report, Lithia warned investors the Oregon initiative represents a risk factor that would raise the company's Oregon tax bill from $3.3 million to $34 million. Lithia reported $183 million in profits last year. "This tax may have a disproportionate effect on us as certain Oregon dealers we compete against may not be organized as C corporations and would not be subject to this tax," Lithia wrote in its quarterly report. Why are tech companies so upset about Measure 97? The initiative taxes most companies based on their sales within Oregon. But it treats software and other services businesses very differently. Through a quirk of existing state law, Oregon companies' software appears subject to Measure 97 taxes – no matter where companies sell the software. Gov. Brown has acknowledged the issue and proposed that legislators create an exemption for software and services if Measure 97 passes so those industries are treated the same as others. Lawmakers have indicated they would do that, but it's impossible to know for sure what would happen as they began weighing trade-offs around other changes to the law. What happens if Measure 97 fails? Oregon projects a shortfall of $1.35 billion in its next budget. Without additional revenue, Brown says state agencies would have to cut their budgets by 10 percent. Measure 97 is the only proposal on the table, right now, to supply additional revenue. Lawmakers have periodically discussed broad tax reform, and, as recently as last spring, some had discussed a legislative alternative to Measure 97. Those talks are sure to resume if voters reject Measure 97, but it's not clear they have a better chance of success than prior efforts. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Lithia's estimate of the tax impact of Measure 97. The company says the initiative would increase its Oregon tax liability from $3.3 million to $34 million, not from a range of $3.3 million to $34 million. — Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

While Apple may have been first to the Thunderbolt party back in 2011, the technology itself was actually a collaboration between the Cupertino firm and Intel’s, and we’ve seen it appear on numerous Windows computers as well as third-party accessories too. Even after five years, though, you could be excused for not realizing why Thunderbolt is such a game-changer. As the name suggests, Thunderbolt 3 is the third-generation of the interconnect technology. Initially, Intel expected it to use optical fiber – in fact, it was originally called Light Peak – but switched to more conventional copper cables before launch. Apple and Intel co-developed it, and indeed Apple originally held the Thunderbolt trademark, though transferred it to its partner in 2011. The original Thunderbolt standard supported up to 10 Gbit/sec per channel. In late 2013, Thunderbolt 2 arrived: it could pair two such channels together into a single data pipe – otherwise known as “channel aggregation” – with a maximum bandwidth of 20 Gbit/s. It was also backward compatible with Thunderbolt devices, and used the same Mini DisplayPort connector. With the arrival of the new MacBook Pro this week, macOS users will have as many as four Thunderbolt 3 ports to play with. It’s not been entirely welcomed with open arms, however, given Apple’s decision also marked the retirement of existing connectors like USB 3.1, HDMI, and MagSafe 2. Still, there are some significant reasons why you should welcome Thunderbolt 3 with open arms – and some reasons to be wary. 1. Thunderbolt 3 gets the ergonomics right While the first- and second-generations of Thunderbolt used the Mini DisplayPort connector, Thunderbolt 3 switches over to USB Type-C. That’s smaller than the old style of plug, not to mention being narrower than USB 3.1 and HDMI. It’s that which helps Apple slim the new MacBook Pro down to as little as 15mm. As we saw with the USB Type-C port on the 12-inch MacBook – which, though it may look like it, doesn’t actually support Thunderbolt 3 – the design also means the Thunderbolt 3 cable is reversible. Just like a Lightning plug, it doesn’t matter which orientation you plug it into your MacBook Pro at: it’ll work either way. If you’ve ever spent a few frustrating seconds jabbing a cable at the side of your laptop, you’ll probably appreciate this particular change. 2. Thunderbolt 3 is fast When you’re abandoning all other ports for one type of connector, it needs to be a capable one. Thankfully, Thunderbolt 3 doubles the bandwidth from what Thunderbolt 2 offered. It’s now up to 40 Gbit/s, or 5 GB/s – if you’re comparing to USB 3, it’s a whole eight times faster. How fast is that in practice? If you’re using a Thunderbolt 3 equipped external drive and your shiny new MacBook Pro to transfer high-definition video, for instance, you could copy over a full day’s worth of footage in less than two minutes. 25,000 photos at the iPhone 7 Plus’ 12-megapixel resolution would take less than a minute to transfer. Obviously you’ll need a fairly cutting-edge peripheral to get the most from that 5 GB/s pipe. Happily there are already a number of Thunderbolt 3 external drives, often using two or more solid-state disks set up in RAID arrays for maximum read/write performance. LaCie, OWC, and other big names in external storage have options that head as high as 120 TB. 3. Thunderbolt 3 is flexible If you’re wondering how manufacturers like Apple can do away with everything but Thunderbolt 3 ports and still have a functional laptop, that’s because it’s flexible as well as being fast. In fact, one single Thunderbolt 3 cable can deliver power, a data connection, and video, all simultaneously. It opens the door to a lot of interesting possibilities on your typical desktop. Because Thunderbolt 3 provides power – up to 100 watts of it, in fact – you can charge your MacBook Pro or another notebook with the port through peripherals which at the same time getting data from them. The power can be delivered in both directions, too, so the computer can provide juice to, say, an external drive or to charge your smartphone. In the case of the new MacBook Pro, you get up to 15W from a Thunderbolt 3 port for external devices. It doesn’t end there, though: there’s video support, too. A single Thunderbolt 3 port is capable of driving a 5K display – that’s 5120 x 2880 resolution – or two 4K displays. If, like the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, the computer has two Thunderbolt controllers that means it can in fact drive two 5K displays. At the same time, a display can provide power back to the laptop, charging it up. If the display’s manufacturer has included data ports – as LG has done with its new UltraFine 5K Monitor – you can have peripherals plugged in too, all linked back via a single cable. With the right cord you can plug straight into a DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort monitor from a Thunderbolt 3 port; there are adapters for HDMI and VGA. 4. Thunderbolt 3 adapters are a way of life Spend much time on the cutting-edge and you’re likely to get, well, cut. In the case of Thunderbolt 3, that means making sure you have backward compatibility with your existing devices and peripherals. After all, Apple isn’t just throwing out older, slower ports: it’s also potentially making your existing cables obsolete. If you want to use a USB 3.1 or earlier device, with the familiar rectangular USB-A plug, you’ll need an adapter for it. The same goes for VGA or HDMI. Thunderbolt 3 is compatible with USB Type-C, but you’ll need an adapter to connect to Thunderbolt 2 or the original Thunderbolt. Those with an iPhone 7 or other iOS device that has a Lightning port, meanwhile, will need one of Apple’s USB-C to Lightning cables. There are also USB-C to micro and mini USB cables, and USB-C to ethernet adapters. Prices for your new dongles range from around $19 to $49 or more, depending on complexity. Even if you have a new MacBook Pro, though, you don’t need to go straight to your Apple store to get your adapter fix. Since Thunderbolt 3 is a broader industry standard, various third-party companies like Belkin, SanDisk, and others are making dongles, docks, and cables with the USB Type-C connector. Eventually, just as was the case with USB Type-A, that should help drive the price down across the board. 5. Thunderbolt 3 isn’t going anywhere All the signs point to Thunderbolt 4 being some way off in the future. The next big step for the interconnect would be support for UHD 8K displays, or 7680 x 4320 resolution, and that’s a huge step up from what Thunderbolt 3 can handle today. Figure on another doubling of the bandwidth being required from the 40 Gbit/s of the current standard. For the moment, then, it seems like the buck stops at Thunderbolt 3. As well as the new MacBook Pro, we’ve seen the port show up on HP’s Spectre 13.3 and other models in the PC maker’s range, while Dell has added the connector to some of its own Windows notebooks. Both companies have made their own docks, too, which act as breakout boxes for traditional USB, display, ethernet, and other devices. Wrap-Up Big changes don’t come easy. Apple ripped the sticking plaster off the port upgrade problem with the new MacBook Pro, and the result has been no shortage of outcry from professional users wondering where they’re supposed to plug their existing drives, SD cards, and other devices into the new notebook. Had Apple opted to more gradually introduce Thunderbolt 3 – perhaps by including it alongside, rather than instead of, those legacy ports – it might’ve made for a less stressful process. NOW READ: Late-2016 MacBook Pro hands-on Problem is, it would also have led to a slower switchover, and it’s in Apple’s best interest – not to mention the best interest of the computing industry as a whole – to get people up and running with Thunderbolt 3 as soon as possible. As we’ve seen with other such changes in the past, it can be a chicken-and-egg problem when it comes to upgrades of this sort. Peripheral makers don’t want to invest in new standards until there’s a sizable enough cohort of users to make it financially worthwhile, and users don’t want to adopt the standards until there’s sufficient third-party support. The upside is, of course, that Thunderbolt 3 has many big advantages over the ports and cables you’ve been using so far. It might be a headache today, but the desktop of tomorrow could be a lot more streamlined and a lot more productive.

Mello Jr. Oct 28, 2016 11:19 AM PT Apple on Thursday unveiled two new MacBook Pro laptops, adding a touch more power to the line. Both the new 13-inch and 15-inch models will be offered in silver and space gray. They have a Touch Bar that replaces the row of function keys found on laptops, as well as a Touch ID fingerprint scanner incorporated into the power button. They sport a Force Touch trackpad that's twice the size of the trackpad in previous models. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is 14.9 millimeters thick, 17 percent thinner than its predecessor. It's also smaller -- 23 percent by volume -- and at 3 pounds, it weighs half a pound less than the previous version. The 15-inch unit is 15.5mm thick, 14 percent thinner than previous models. It too has a smaller footprint than its previous generation, 20 percent by volume, and it tilts the scales at 4 pounds, also a half pound lighter than its predecessor. Both units have an improved version of the "butterfly" keyboard introduced in Apple's 12-inch MacBook, as well as a key dedicated to Apple's digital assistant Siri. They also have four Thunderbolt USB-C ports that can be used for a variety of tasks, including charging the units. "Four Thunderbolt ports are a tremendous amount of bandwidth," said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "You can support two 4K displays, a 4K camera and an external storage array all at the same time with the 15-inch MacBook Pro," he told TechNewsWorld. "That's a lot of power." Brighter, Faster, Louder The MacBook displays also have been upgraded. For example, the screen on the new 15-inch model is 67 percent brighter, with a 67 percent greater contrast ratio and 25 percent more colors. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro runs on a 6th generation Intel Core i7 quad processor with 2133 MHz memory. It has Radeon Pro graphics based on AMD's Polaris architecture. It can deliver graphics 2.3 times faster than the previous generation of the laptop. The unit now supports up to 2 terabytes of solid state storage, and it's faster -- 50 percent faster than the previous model. The speakers also are better. They not only produce greater volume, but also have two times the dynamic range of previous models. The new 13-inch model runs on 6th generation i5 or i7 Intel chips, also mated to 2133 MHz system memory. It has Intel Iris graphics, as well as storage speeds twice those of its predecessor. Touch Bar The Touch Bar feature on the new MacBook Pros definitely was the star of the Apple's Thursday show. The bar is a high-resolution touch display that replaces the function keys on the laptop. The display is context aware, so it can change its content based on the application running in the foreground of the computer. "It's a disruptive new implementation," said Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner. "It's not new to see a dynamically adaptable bar," he told TechNewsWorld, "but as usual, Apple has taken something that's already out there and perfected it." The bar acts almost as a second monitor. Items can be dragged from the main display to the bar. "That's something that will capture the user's imagination and will be a great differentiator for Apple going forward," Goertz said. The Touch Bar is a game changer for Apple, according to Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. "It allows not only Apple, but also developers to create custom connections to their applications, and make those applications more interactive and easier to access," he told TechNewsWorld. "Apple emphasized the role of the MacBook Pro for creativity," Bajarin continued, "but that Touch Bar will be extremely attractive to even mainstream consumers, because it changes how they interact with applications." Apple TV Along with the new MacBook Pro announcements, Apple revealed a new app for Apple TV and iOS aimed at unifying a user's TV experience. Called "TV," the free app displays an aggregate view of all shows and movies the user currently is watching through other apps. It also recommends programming based on the user's tastes. It provides access to a library of iTunes purchases and rentals, and a store for buying more content. "We want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television," said Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Thursday event. With 1600 apps available for Apple TV, it's become necessary for someone to step in and make it easier to discover and organize content, explained Bajarin. "The new TV app is designed specifically for that purpose," he said. Revenue Driver Apple TV will be a growth area for the company in 2017, noted Trip Chowdhry, managing director for equity research at Global Equities Research. "Service revenues this quarter grew 24 percent, probably because of Apple TV," he told TechNewsWorld. "That growth could accelerate in 2017 with the new Apple TV app." Although Apple believes its TV app will completely change how people will watch TV, Gartner's Goertz maintained the app will be less disruptive than Apple expects it will be. "If you look at what Amazon and others are doing with TV, it's what Apple is doing now," he said. "For that reason, I didn't see the TV app that disruptive." The absence of any mention of Apple TV's potential as a smart home hub was disappointing, Goertz added. "Apple is still lagging behind the Amazons of this world when it comes to the smart home," he said. There was no hint of restraint in Apple CEO Tim Cook's enthusiasm, however. "We couldn't be more excited about having our best product lineup ever heading into the holiday season," he said at the close of the event. The new 13-inch MacBook with function keys sells for US$1,499 and is available immediately. The Touch Bar models are available for preorder and will go on sale in two to three weeks, with the 13-inch version selling for $1,799 and the 15-incher for $2,399.

Photo by Rick Wilking/Reuters Editor’s Note: Economist Dean Baker is the author of the new book, “Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer.” Below, he outlines a case he makes in his book, arguing that the changes in intellectual property law over the last four decades, which make patents, copyrights and related protections longer and stronger, have been important factors in the upward redistribution of income. There is a recurring concern in discussions about the economy that technology threatens the livelihood of large segments of the workforce. The exact mechanism varies. In one version, the robots will take all the jobs, leading to a massive surge in unemployment. A somewhat different version has the development of technology benefiting people with college and advanced degrees to the detriment of those with less education. In this story, the highly educated do well, while the less educated see stagnant or declining wages. While the future may actually be one of continually rising inequality, it is important to realize that technology is not the culprit. While the future may actually be one of continually rising inequality, it is important to realize that technology is not the culprit. It is not the technology that determines who gets the benefits of major innovations; it is laws that govern technology, which in turn are made by politicians. Specifically, the laws on patents and intellectual property more generally will determine whether advances in technology are associated with increasing inequality or broadly shared prosperity. Starting with the robot story, we are supposed to be concerned that robots will replace workers in factories and warehouses. Robots can do the job better and cheaper. We will also have self-driving cars, trucks and buses. This will displace millions of additional workers and radically reduce the demand for cars. (We can summon a car to take us from point A to point B when we need it. There is no reason to have a car rusting in front of our house.) READ MORE: Inventor behind Priceline bemoans broken patent system That’s the displacement story, but suppose that robots are extremely cheap. There is no obvious reason they shouldn’t be cheap. After all, we probably won’t need any rare materials to make robots. And presumably robots could be mostly manufactured by other robots, so the labor involved wouldn’t be expensive. In this case, we should be able to buy a robot at our local hardware store or from our favorite internet retailer for a few hundred dollars. Once we buy the robot, we can have it clean our house, cook our food, mow our lawn and do all sorts of other tasks that we may not want to do ourselves. We can probably even save on our food budget by having the robot plant and tend a vegetable garden. If robots are doing all this work for us and we no longer need to buy and maintain a car to meet our transportation needs, we should have all have a high standard of living. We will spend over $430 billion in 2016 on drugs that would likely sell for 10 to 20 percent of this amount in a free market. But suppose that patents and related protections keep the price of robots high. And instead of technology driving down the cost of transportation with self-driving cars to almost nothing, patent monopolies allow the top executives and shareholders of Uber or its equivalent to get very rich at the expense of the rest of the population. In that scenario, most people may not benefit to any great extent from technology. In that case, robots may take our jobs, but instead of the benefits from productivity growth being passed along in higher wages and lower prices, as was true in past decades, the benefits go to minority of well-situated individuals. To some extent we have already seen this story as Congress has repeatedly acted to make patent and related protections stronger and longer. In the longer category, copyright protection has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Patent protection has been extended from 14 years from the date of issuance to 20 years from the date of application, with a wide variety of conditions allowing for further extensions. Patent protection was also extended to new areas so that it now applies to life forms, software and business methods. The impact of these stronger protections is most visible in the area of prescription drugs. We will spend over $430 billion in 2016 (2.3 percent of GDP) on drugs that would likely sell for 10 to 20 percent of this amount in a free market. In addition to patent protection, drug manufacturers can also now enjoy data exclusivity for test data and a wide variety of other protections that act to prevent generic competition. READ MORE: Why are most inventors men? The problem associated with excessive protection of intellectual property is vividly illustrated with the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. This drug has a list price in the United States of $84,000 for a three month course of treatment. A high-quality generic version is available in India for $200. Insurers and governments have struggled to come up with the money to pay for Sovaldi and, in many cases, have sought to deny treatment to patients. If Sovaldi could be purchased at its generic price, the cost of treatment would be a non-issue for those with Hepatitis C. Those who developed and marketed Sovaldi are now getting very rich as a result of its high price. But this is not a story of technology making them rich; it is a story of government-granted patent monopolies making them rich. If we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots. Of course we do need a mechanism to support research, innovation and creative work. But there is little evidence that the lengthening and strengthening of intellectual property protection in the last four decades has led to a faster pace of innovation. Furthermore, there are other mechanisms for financing research. We spend over $30 billion a year supporting biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. This mostly supports basic research, but there is no reason that the funding could not be expanded with additional funds devoted explicitly to the developing and testing of new drugs. Most importantly, we have to understand that the incomes that people earn as a result of intellectual property protections are due to government policy. They are not the result of technology. If we are bothered by the upward redistribution of income of the last four decades, we should be looking at how we support the process of innovation, not blaming robots. Dean Baker Dean Baker is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which he co-founded in 1999. His areas of research include housing and macroeconomics, intellectual property, Social Security, Medicare and European labor markets. @DeanBaker13 SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER SHARE VIA TEXT inequality innovation Innovation and Invention intellectual property Making Sen$e Making Sen$e Columnist patent robots PREVIOUS POST Column: Why do wealthy nations unravel?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft to reveal more details about its 3rd party VR/AR plans at December event 1 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Oct 28, 2016 at 15:07 GMT3 weeks ago At Computex this year, Microsoft first announced that Windows Holographic is coming to devices of all shapes and sizes from fully immersive virtual reality to fully untethered holographic computing. They invited Windows OEM, ODM, and hardware partners to build PCs, displays, accessories and mixed reality devices with the Windows Holographic platform. A few months later at the Intel Developer Forum, Microsoft announced that they are working with Intel on a specification for mixed reality ready PCs and head mounted displays (HMDs). They want to enable their hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets. Even though they are already working with several partners on the spec, they are planning to release publicly release v1 of the spec at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference in Shenzhen in December. At the Windows 10 event earlier this week, Microsoft demoed a mixed reality device from its OEM partner which is powered by Windows Holographic. That mixed reality device was the result of the last six months of work Microsoft did with their partners since Computex 2016. Microsoft is not only providing the spec, the initial group of devices were co-engineered with Microsoft using the technology and software created to power the HoloLens. Microsoft will talk about the field of view, resolution, and other details about these devices at WinHEC event later this year. This WinHEC event is scheduled for December 8 – 9, 2016. This fall’s events will consist of talks and presentations by Microsoft Windows and Devices executives and experts who will explain in detail our vision and plans, including specifications and guidance. Attendees will leave these WinHEC events understanding the details of end-to-end enablement for Windows Holographic and what’s next for Windows 10. Last month, Microsoft announced the expanded availability of HoloLens in six new countries. Developers and commercial enterprises from Australia, Ireland, France, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom can now pre-order the device from Microsoft Stores.

The convertible’s small body may hark back memories of the netbook era, but HP packed plenty of muscle into this year’s model, making it a worthy, affordable and no-compromise alternative to Microsoft’s premiumly priced Surface Book. When the Spectre x360 launched last year, HP proved that it had the design chops to out-Apple in crafting beautiful, well-made computers. The obsessive attention to details paid off: the machined aluminum Spectre x360 rivals Apple’s 2015 MacBook Air and Pro in design, build quality and craftsmanship, while edging ahead in performance and features. With this year’s launch HP has refined the Spectre x360’s design, shaving away any unneeded space from the previous generation, while at the same time adding features that consumers want: longer battery life, a stronger processor and a slimmer design. The result is a convertible that’s equally as beautiful as it is powerful, and for consumers shopping for a laptop-first form factor, this year’s Spectre x360 is the convertible to beat. Even if you’re in the market for a plain Ultrabook (and not a convertible), you’ll be remiss to dismiss the Spectre x360. Thinner than Air If you covered up HP’s new logo—comprised of slanted lines of different lengths—the Spectre x360 can easily be mistaken for one of Apple’s notebooks, a testament to the premium aesthetic HP created. Like the MacBook Air that HP is gunning for, the Spectre x360 is machined out of a block of aluminum with straight lines and rounded corners, and the laptop is finished in a matte silver hue with polished side edges Like the MacBook, the machined aluminum gives the Spectre a solid feel, though the choice of metal is more susceptible to wear and tear, especially when compared to the greater durability of magnesium alloy on Microsoft’s Surface Book. I’ve noticed a few scuffs and chips along the polished edges of the Spectre with use, but these battle wounds in no way affect the laptop’s performance or functionality. Open up the lid, and you’ll begin to see how the Spectre x360 isn’t just another MacBook Air ($999) clone. Like the competing Dell XPS 13 ($799) and Lenovo Yoga 910 ($1,329), the Spectre’s 13.3-inch touchscreen display lacks the giant bezels that frame the right and left edges of the Air’s screen. HP claimed that it had reduced the side bezels by 64 percent compared to last year’s model, and the result is visually stunning. The slimmer bezels mean that this year’s Spectre x360 occupies an even smaller footprint, making it easier to slip into a bag for travel. Unlike the XPS, which slims down the bezels on the sides and on top, HP decided to keep some bezeling around the top of the Spectre. This means that the display looks less futuristic on the Spectre, with about 0.63-inches of black border, but HP’s design decision lends to a more functional notebook for video conferencing. The extra space up top accommodates a full HD camera for video calls, and this placement is more ideal than the bottom placement on Dell’s XPS 13. There’s also an IR face recognition camera for password-less Windows Hello logins. Additionally, unlike the competing Lenovo Yoga 910, the added space up top provides an area for you to comfortably hold the Spectre when used as a tablet. For users choosing between the Spectre x360 and Apple’s newly minted MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar, the Spectre’s touchscreen may offer more utility for everyday computing tasks. The result of the Spectre x360’s dieting efforts is that HP is able to create a 13.3-inch notebook that’s marginally larger than Apple’s 2015 11.6-inch MacBook Air. The Spectre measures 12.03 × 8.58 × 0.54 inches, making it just 0.23 inches wider and 1.02 inches deeper than Apple’s 11-inch notebook. And despite slimming down the Spectre x360’s profile, the Spectre packs in technology—like a new 360-degree geared hinge, room-filling speakers, touchscreen display and Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor in a sturdy design—that MacBook Air owners could only dream of having. And with these innovations, the Spectre still manages to be 0.14 inches thinner than the Air. Making the Needed Sacrifices For owners of last year’s model, HP’s focus on fine tuning the Spectre’s design isn’t without compromises. Features had to be cut in order to squeeze the Spectre x360 into its slimmer, tighter-fitting outfit this year. On the display front, the Spectre x360 launches with only a full HD configuration—the 2015 model could be outfitted with up to a QHD resolution panel—and there’s no option for inking with a stylus, a feature that could be useful for students, digital artists and note-takers. Defending HP’s decision to launch with a single FHD resolution screen configuration, Mike Nash, HP Vice President of Customer Experience and Portfolio Strategy, said that an overwhelming majority of consumers asked for that feature. Additionally, coupled with the power consumption savings delivered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, Nash said that the FHD resolution allows for longer battery life. HP claims that the new model delivers up to 15 hours of battery life, up from nine hours last year. Despite the limited launch configurations, HP is looking into the possibility of launching a QHD Spectre x360 with active digitizer support in the future, so you may want to hold off on purchasing if these features are important to you. If you can look past the limited FHD resolution right now, the screen is bright, vivid and capable of displaying 72 percent of the color space. Blacks on the screen were inky, and I didn’t notice the same light bleed around the display’s edges as I did on my Surface Book. Most consumers will find the screen resolution acceptable for everyday computing tasks. While HP may have taketh away, it also giveth, to paraphrase the adage. Executives claim that in removing unnecessary features, the company was able to devote resources into features that consumers want and keep costs down. Compared to last year’s model, the features that HP were able to deliver on the 2016 Spectre x360 include an edge-to-edge backlit keyboard, a wide glass trackpad and a new speaker arrangement that makes listening to audio a pleasure regardless if you use the Spectre x360 in laptop or tablet mode. The problem with last year’s x360 is that the downward-firing speakers sounded great when used in laptop mode, but when you activate the 360-degree hinge, the speakers quickly became muffled when used in tablet mode. This year, HP also added two more speakers to the top, which helps deliver loud, crisp audio when converted into tablet use. I found the quad-array speakers produced loud enough audio to fill my living room, and there was very minimal distortion even at the highest volume settings. Audio fidelity was passable, but for longer listening sessions, I’d want to use the HP Audio Switch app and external speakers. The bundled app makes it easy to switch between your internal speakers and microphones to wired or wireless setups on the fly. HP’s software makes it simple to control your audio input and output sources, and it’s a feature that’s so basic that we wonder why it hasn’t already been a staple on PCs in the past. A Converting Ultrabook With a more traditional design than Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 or HP’s Spectre x2, the x360 looks and performs more like an Ultrabook in laptop mode. HP says that there is 1.3mm of key travel on the keyboard. HP claims that the higher actuation force required for key presses make the keys feel comfortable. In use, I found the full-sized backlit keyboard good. The 1.2mm of key travel makes it far more comfortable to type than the shallow keys on Apple’s MacBook, but compared to a business-class notebook, I found the keys slightly stiff and bottom out a little too quickly. For notebook users, the good keyboard and excellent glass-covered touchpad makes this convertible a pleasure to use all day. If you’re typing in darker environments, the problem with the white backlight and HP’s silver keycap design is that the combo makes it hard to to read the etched numbers and letters on the keys at certain angles. Compared to last year’s model, the 2016 Spectre x360 is light on ports, but that’s because the two USB Type-C ports offer more versatility. The USB Type-C ports can be used to connect accessories, peripherals, power and displays, negating the need for a standalone HDMI port or power plug. The ports also support the Thunderbolt 3 specifications. Additionally, there is a single USB Type-A port for legacy peripherals alongside a 3.5mm combo headphone and microphone jack. On the left hand side, there is a large air vent and a power button, and the volume rocker sits on the right edge. The side placement of the power and volume switches make them accessible whether you’re using the x360 as a laptop or tablet. In reality, notebook users won’t even need to even hit the power button. Fast resume from sleep means you can just open the lid, hit the enter key and start using your laptop in a little under five seconds. There are also volume control keys on the keyboard deck. Unfortunately, to keep its slim profile, a memory card slot did not make the cut on this year’s model—you can still use an SD card adapter with the device’s USB port. Combined with the lack of stylus support, this year’s Spectre x360 may not fit the bill for creative professionals or photographers who may want a lighter notebook than Microsoft’s Surface Book. Fast Performance Our review unit of the Spectre x360 shipped with Intel’s Core i7-7500U processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, 16GB RAM and a 512GB Samsung NVMe solid state drive. HP will offer configurations that max out with 1TB SSD storage. As expected with Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, the Spectre performs well, scoring 3,354 points using PCMark 8 Home Test. For comparison, my Microsoft Surface Book equipped with last year’s Intel’s 6th Generation Core i5 processor scored just 2,360 points using the same test. The Spectre x360 also posted competitive graphics scores against other Core i5 and Core i7 systems with integrated Intel graphics using Cinebench and 3DMark tests. Gamers will likely want to look at a system with discrete graphics, but the integrated Intel graphics performed smoothly streaming 4K videos, with light game play and basic photo and video editing. Also contributing to the Spectre’s zippy performance is the fact that HP didn’t saddle its convertible with a ton of bloatware. The Windows 10 build that ships with the x360 is relatively clean, save for a few preloaded titles, like McAfee Antivirus, HP Audio Switch app— an utility that’s actually useful—and a warranty registration checker app that notifies you of the warranty status of your Spectre and any other connected HP products that you may have, including printers. PCMark 8’s intensive battery drain test produced a result of 4 hours and 4 minutes, up from the Surface Book’s score of just under four hours. In real life, I found HP’s 15-hour battery life claims to be largely accurate. I was able to squeeze in 13 hours of use while browsing the web, watching YouTube clips, playing music and performing productivity tests. I didn’t experience any lags with the device in day-to-day use, and the starting price of $1,049 for a Core i5 model with 4GB RAM and 256GB SSD makes it extremely competitive against the Surface Book, which starts at $1,499 before discounts. A similarly configured Surface Book with last year’s Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD would cost $1,699. If you can live without the Surface Book’s high resolution display, the option to detach the screen and inking capabilities, the Spectre x360 delivers better all-around performance at a much more affordable price point. Verdict While the Surface Book retains its place as an aspirational convertible notebook in Microsoft’s Windows ecosystem, delivering enticing features to creative professionals, HP’s Spectre x360 is a notebook built for everyday consumers. Sure, the device lacks some of the glitzier features of its more expensive rival—like a detachable display and pen support for note-taking—but the Spectre more than makes up for it with an affordable price tag, compact footprint, long battery life and fast performance. The refinements on this year’s model shows HP’s maturity as a company. The Spectre ships with the company’s new logo on the lid, and HP clearly listened to its customers to include only features that are relevant to a majority of its user base, stripping away unneeded extras that would have otherwise contributed to a higher price tag. If you choose the Spectre x360, you won’t get the highest resolution display, but HP’s no-frills approach produced one of the best and beautifully designed all-around convertibles at an affordable starting price.

Six years ago, when Ravindra Parab decided to become an e-waste scrap dealer, he could not have imagined that this job would help his son, Jayant, achieve a breakthrough in affordable technology.Seventeen-year-old Jayant, a resident of Ghatkopar, Mumbai, was in Class 3 when he used a PC for the first time: “We had computer classes as a part of the school curriculum and that was the first time I actually used a PC. Till then, the box-shaped machines had always intrigued me because I saw them everywhere I went – in offices, banks and shops. But getting the opportunity to actually work on one was nothing short of thrilling!” he remembered. Like most beginner computer classes, his school classes too focused on teaching the basics – different parts of a PC and, with time, an introduction to MS Office. For Jayant, every class helped peel back yet another layer of the mystery the machines held for him. When Jayant reached Class 5, his thirst to learn more pushed him to ask his father’s permission to enrol for a course at the local computer centre. “It was a month-long introductory course for beginners. While the computer classes in school introduced me to PCs, it was this course that made me confident about operating the machine,” he said. The course also marked the beginning of many other classes Jayant would go on to take in the years to come, helping him gain mastery over the ubiquitous technology. Between school and his courses, Jayant also took to tinkering around with the e-waste his father brought home: “I picked up a lot from watching my father and my brother work and, before long, I was able to assess on my own whether some pieces could be salvaged or not. My father and brother then taught me how to take the pieces apart, how to determine what was wrong with them, fix the problems, and put them back together again,” Jayant remembered. “The courses I attended taught me a lot about different software, but it is the hours I spent working with e-waste that helped me understand the minutest details about the functioning of PCs.” Jayant’s growing interest also encouraged his father to set up a second-hand PC at home for his tech-savvy son. “This gave me the opportunity to practise everything I learnt, at my own pace and on my own time. I also used the internet to learn new things, every day,” he said. View photos Jayant Parab with his PCMore Jayant used his PC to introduce children in his neighbourhood to the life-changing technology: “I realised that many of these children had limited exposure to PCs and came from families that could not afford to buy their own machines. Given how all-pervasive this technology is, I thought it was extremely important that they be well-versed in it too. I believe that people’s socio-economic status should not hold them back in life or deprive them of opportunities,” explained Jayant. With this in mind, Jayant began holding informal classes for the children in his neighbourhood. “We’d meet up twice or thrice a week, for a couple of hours, and I’d teach them about the basics of operating a PC,” he said.

MAKING THE BEST OUT OF WASTE View photos e-waste computerMore “I had seen how the exposure to PCs I provided to the children in my neighbourhood was helping them. They were able to work on PCs more confidently now and were even using them for school projects. And I couldn’t help but wonder how much more they would be able to do if they had their own PCs at home,” Jayant explained. “The main aim was to create something that all sections of society would find affordable.” Read More “Admittedly, it was a bit of a daunting task; I had not heard of such a computer being made before, so I had no blueprint that I could follow, no tutorials I could refer to,” he confessed. Yet, that did not deter the 17-year-old. For a month, Jayant worked hard, rushing home from school and completing his homework in record time, in order to devote at least four hours every day to his project.

But, sometimes, he would get lucky, as he did with his monitor: “My father also collects e-waste from hospitals and he came across a broken ECG machine. When he brought it home, I picked it apart, saw that the problem with it was only minor, fixed it and upgraded it, and decided to use it as a monitor,” he explained enthusiastically. Bit by painstaking bit, Jayant put together his e-waste computer, under the watchful guidance of his father and brother. “I was given strict instructions to not do any heavy-duty electrical work unless my father or brother were present. They were always around to help and their support was unwavering, but they also let me figure things out on my own and didn’t push me,” he said. The end result was a compact PC, with a 9-inch monitor, 2GB RAM and 1GB hard disk. “It runs on LINUX and has inbuilt speakers, Bluetooth and Wifi. The PC can be used for work or personal use and is equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software too,” he listed. THE WAY FORWARD View photos e-waste computerMore The unique PC got Jayant appreciation from all quarters, including a certificate from the organisers of the exhibition. “The exhibition draws school children from across the city and, for me, the fact that I was able to show them that building something like this was possible, that was the real win,” he said. Jayant also believes that making PCs from e-waste can prove to be an additional source of income for rag-pickers and scrap dealers. “Imagine if we train them to properly collect e-waste, to assess the quality of the e-waste, and to repair different pieces to put them together as PCs... They could sell these machines and have an alternative source of income. What’s more, they would also be helping deal with the huge e-waste problem while making PCs affordable to a large section of society,” he explained. Jayant has since built a second PC from e-waste: “I am constantly tinkering with it and trying to improve and upgrade it.” You may also like: How Children from India’s Largest Slum Are Turning App Developers to Solve Community Problems Jayant, who was forced to drop-out of school after he failed his Class 9 examination, is now studying for Class 10 through correspondence. He also continues to attend computer courses and, recently, completed a course in hardware networking. “Knowledge of computers is essential for surviving in today’s world. The first question in any job interview is whether the applicant knows how to operate a PC or not. Every single person needs to know how to use a PC,” he said. “I want to continue doing more courses and further hone my skills so that I am able to make a successful career in computers,” he concluded.

MacBook Pro 2016 – What's new and should I upgrade? by Joe Roberts 27 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments How does the newly refreshed Macbook Pro compare to the previous models, and is it worth an upgrade? We take a look. Apple has finally taken the wraps off its new MacBook Pros, and they look like some impressive machines, coming complete with that long-rumoured OLED panel and a bump in hardware. But is it enough to warrant an upgrade from the existing MacBook Pro, or one of the older models? With that question in mind, we thought we'd take an early look at how the 2016 MacBook Pro stacks up against the existing models. Here's everything you need to know: Related: 5 things you need to know about the new MacBook Pro 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Design Before the new MacBook Pro arrived, the laptop's design was around four years old. Even with that seemingly outdated design, the 2015 laptop still looks and feels as fresh as the day Apple first unveiled it. The 2015 13-inch model weighs just 1.58kg and is 18mm thick, which isn't as thin as the new 13-inch model, which measures in at 14.9mm. In terms of the 15-inch models, the previous design weighs 2.04kg and is also 18mm thick, while the new 15-inch model comes in at 15.5mm. Both the old and new models are highly portable, but the 2016 versions are undoubtedly more compact. What's more, they takes a lot of design cues from the latest MacBook models, with four USB Type-C ports which can be used to charge the machine or as a thunderbolt, USB, display, HDMI out, or VGI ports. That means no MagSafe charger port. The 2015 model, on the other hand, comes with a MagSafe port, two Thunderbolt 2 connections, two USB 3 ports, a headphone jack, an HDMI out port, and an SDXC card slot. The OLED Touch Bar above the keyboard is the biggest addition to the 2015 MacBook. The tactile strip replaces the function keys, and can display context-sensitive actions depending on what you're doing on-screen. It also means you'll be able to log in to the laptop using a your fingerprint with Apple's Touch ID technology. None of this appears on the 2015 model MacBook Pro. One feature that does appear on both models is the Force Touch trackpad with pressure-sensing capabilities. The pads on both models will allow you to click at three different pressure levels – light, medium and heavy – giving you a few extra options when it comes to certain programs. The pad on the new model is much larger, however. Related: macOS Sierra review Overall, the new models look to be much sleeker devices than their predecessors, and there's no doubt the OLED touch panel is a distinctly cool and seemingly functional addition that adds to the modern design. 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Display Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models of the 2015 MacBook Pro come with what Apple calls Retina displays. That means on the 13-inch option you'll get a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution LED-backlit display with IPS technology, making for a pixel-per-inch density of 227. On the 15-inch model, you'll get a 2880 x 1,800 resolution at 220 pixels per inch. Related: MacBook Pro 2015 review What does that mean in practice? Well, if our experience with the 13-inch model is anything to go by, expect razor-sharp images. And while we're yet to test out the new versions of the MacBook Pro, we're expecting the machines to provide similar, if not better quality. Apple says the new screen is 67% brighter than the previous version, has 67% higher contrast ratio, and 25% more colours. In terms of resolution, the 13-inch models come with the same 2,560 x 1,600 offering, while the 15-inch variant comes with an impressive 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. We'll have a better idea of the jump in quality once we've tested out the new Pros. 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Hardware Apple has made a lot of updates to the MacBook Pro internals with the new models. We tested out the entry level version of last year's model, which comes with 128GB flash storage, a 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris graphics and 8GB RAM. The range also provided the option to upgrade several aspects of the internals, with the 15-inch model coming with quad-core i7s instead of the dual-core i5 chips in the 13-inch models. Related: Best laptop This time around, Apple has switched to Intel's new 6th generation Skylake processors, offering an Intel Core i5 or i7 dual-core chip depending on the configuration you choose. That should ensure a noticeable bump in performance, though it should be said that last year's models were no slouch in the performance department. You'll get a speedy user experience either way, but the new models are much more capable than their predecessors. In terms of RAM, the 2015 models came with either 8GB or 16GB, which is the same on the new models, depending on which variant you go for, while storage is now configurable up to 2TB and is much faster on the new MacBook Pros. And when it comes to battery life, the new models also should manage to improve on their predecessors. The 13-inch 2015 MacBook Pro came with a 74.9-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, offering up to 10 hours wireless web and up to 12 hours iTunes film playback. On the 15-inch variant, the 99.5-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery provided up to nine hours wireless web and up to nine hours iTunes film playback. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 54.5Wh battery (10-hour browsing, 30-day standby) while the version with the Touch Bar comes with a 49.2Wh offering, which somehow manages to offer the same 10-hour browsing and 30-day standby. On the 15-inch version, there's a 76Wh cell which, again offers the same 10-hour browsing, 30-day standby. We'll have more on this when we've reviewed the new models. 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Software There's no difference here. Both the 2015 and 2016 MacBooks come with the latest macOS Sierra. The OS introduces a range of upgrades over the previous OS X El Capitan, with neater iCloud integration – particularly the Universal Clipboard and Desktop iCloud sync – as well as Siri integration, which means you'll now be able to use the virtual assistant on your desktop. For some new features, you'll need to have an iOS device, which doesn't make either the 2015 or 2016 MacBook Pro as useful for those who use an Android handset. But that really only matters if you plan on using Auto Unlock or paying for goods using Apple Pay. Overall macOS Sierra is a stellar operating system that builds upon the previous iterations, adding new features and maintaining the best ones from OS X. It should run a bit quicker on the new MacBook Pros, but we're not sure how noticeable the difference will be. We'll have more once we've tried out the new models. 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Price The MacBook Pro 2015 models will undoubtedly come down in price now that we've got the new iterations. At the time of writing, you can buy a 13-inch version starting at £999, while the 15-inch model starts at £1,599. When it comes to the 2016 versions, Apple is offering the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar for £1,449, while the version with the OLED panel will start at £1,749. If you go for the 15-inch variant, you're looking at a starting price of £2,349. 2016 MacBook Pro vs old MacBook Pro – Summary Without trying out the new models, its difficult to give a definitive verdict. At this point, it's looking like Apple has packed in enough upgraded hardware and new design elements to justify an upgrade from last year's model, and certainly enough to justify upgrading from older versions. The new MacBook Pros will undoubtedly be quicker, easier to travel with, and generally sleeker than the 2015 models. Plus, the Touch Bar seems to be more than a gimmick, providing some seemingly useful functionality. In that sense, this looks like a fairly easy one to call, but we'll reserve our final verdict until we've reviewed the 2016 MacBook Pro, so stay tuned for more.

Fairly mediocre increases in performance and minor evolutions in hardware design. tcsekhar October 27, 2016, 8:31 pm Negatives: Still Quad Core 2.7GHz, 16GB is the max RAM, $1,200 for 2TB SSD, no function keys, no USB slots, no card reader, need to carry more adapters Positives: Thinner, Brighter, more colors, larger trackpad.. That's an awesome upgrade. Makes it a must buy! GO-APPLE!! ;) Bri Guy October 28, 2016, 6:09 am Correction!

Intel Releases New Firmware for SSD 750 Series - Get Firmware Update Tool 2.1.6 The devices receive NVME IO Queue Metrics log page support Oct 28, 2016 08:14 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has made available a new Solid State Drive Firmware Update Tool, namely version 2.1.6, which updates its SSD 750 series  firmware and bootloader revisions to 8EV101F0 and 8B1B0133, respectively. To be more specific, Intel's SSD 750 series includes the 1.2 TB and 400 GB models (either 1/2 Height or 2.5in PCIe 3.0), as well as its 800 GB 1/2 Height and 2.5in PCIe 3.0 x4 drives. In terms of changes, the current update tool will add NVME IO Queue Metrics and Secure Erase Command Monitoring log page support and will resolve the issue where the drive is entering disable logical mode after frequent, repeated OS reboots. Moreover, the SSD 750 series will receive an updated Secure Erase Command User Data Erase option, sequential read performance improvements, product health enhancements, as well as a fix for 4k+DIF read errors (after a format) when using Intel SPDK. In addition to that, besides the changes mentioned above, the present release includes all prior changes targeted at currently supported Solid State Drives, as highlighted in the Release Notes below. When it comes to installation, first save the downloadable .iso or zip file (the zip includes an additional User Guide), back up your SSD, turn off Drive Password Protection, and burn the ISO to a blank CD/DVD or USB flash drive. Now, boot from the newly-prepared CD/USB drive, accept the License Agreement to continue, select the SSD you want to upgrade, hit the Update button (or click Update All), and wait patiently for the installation to finish. As for recommendations, before starting the installation, it would be a good idea to backup your important data just to be safe, make sure the system is plugged into AC power (just for notebooks), and close all programs and processes that might interfere with the upgrade. With this in mind, download Intel SSD Firmware Update Tool 2.1.6 and carefully follow the steps mentioned above to enjoy the benefits of this new release.

Unveiled Today The Mac maker's product event was more or less entirely expected. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 27, 2016 at 8:05PM Image source: Apple. Well, would you look at that. For once, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled something that wasn't entirely expected at its Mac event earlier today. Ahead of the unveiling, the rumors had narrowed in on three new MacBook models, and no iMac refresh. While new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros were obvious, it wasn't entirely clear what the other rumored 13-inch MacBook would be. Some thought it would be a new MacBook Air with USB-C ports. As it turns out, it was just another 13-inch MacBook Pro instead of a tweaked Air. Three's company As expected, the new MacBook Pros feature a dynamic display above the keyboard, replacing the traditional function keys with a versatile toolbar that can change contextually. Apple calls this the Touch Bar, and it can morph into various different tools and buttons depending on what task you're doing or what application you're using. Integrated into the right side of the Touch Bar is a small second-generation Touch ID sensor, finally bringing Apple's fingerprint recognition technology to the Mac. This can be used to unlock the computer, switch user profiles, or use Apple Pay on the web for websites that have adopted Apple's payment service. Image source: Apple. Intel's six-generation Skylake chips are onboard at long last, bringing the MacBook Pro lineup up to speed in a much-needed upgrade. The Mac maker is moving toward Thunderbolt 3 ports, which include support for USB-C and a wide range of other protocols. And yes, there is a headphone jack. The keyboard is similar to the 12-inch MacBook, using a second generation of Apple's butterfly mechanism. Naturally, this is the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro Apple has ever made. (Stop me if you've heard that one before.) The surprise move was that Apple is making a version without the Touch Bar and Touch ID, instead using traditional function keys, but still within the new chassis. There are also only two Thunderbolt 3 ports as opposed to four. The 13-inch MacBook Pro that has traditional function keys will start at $1,499, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at $1,799. That $300 premium is a hefty ask for what amounts to a small display (which is presumably OLED based on rumors, but Apple did not specify) and a Touch ID sensor. All 15-inch models include the Touch Bar and Touch ID and start at $2,399. Other Macs continue to age There was no mention of updates for any other Macs. The Mac Mini is still incredibly old, with the last upgrade being two years ago. The Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013. There was some speculation that Apple would update the iMac 5K with new graphics processors from AMD, but nope. The 27-inch iMac 5K already uses the latest Intel chips, and appropriate desktop-class seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips simply aren't ready yet. This event was all about the MacBook Pro. As the most important product within the Mac lineup, hopefully the new laptops will help Apple's Mac business grow again after losing share for the past two to three quarters.

Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaard-skin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. De belangrijkste veranderingen die in bèta 5 zijn doorgevoerd zijn hieronder voor je samengevat. Fixes done in this Beta 5: Fix playback of HLS streams Fix skin settings not loading when “reload skin” was triggered Fix segfault on EOF for video caused by postprocessing Fix possible crash on Android when other Android apps had missing icons Change splash screen text once per second to show it’s busy doing database and add-on upgrades instead of just static text. Fix missing binary add-ons like PVR and controller handling on Windows Add back seek to time using numeric input on video files Microsoft has rolled out a fix for users of the Kodi UWP version in combination with AMD videocard that had BSOD. For more information see: Blue screen with error code 0x139 Known problems Upgrading the skin you are currently using fails on Windows. Upgrading any add-on currently fails on Windows. Possible video freezes on Raspberry Pi and Android. We are trying to find the cause solve these problems. Of course there are some more however these are the most noticeable ones. Remember this is still Beta software so please be patient.

Auto-updates en een mooie LiveTile in je Startscherm. Ik hoop dat veel applicaties snel volgen. Ik denk ook dat des te meer applicaties als UWP versie verschijnen, des te stabieler Windows gaat worden op den duur. Omdat de apps in een sandbox draaien, automatisch updaten en niet meer de centrale registry gebruiken. Met 1 klik installeren en met 1 klik de-installeren zonder dat er troep achterblijft. Ik zeg, kom maar door - Filezilla - CCleaner - uTorrent - Spotify - MPC-HC - WhatsApp - Firefox etc. etc. etc. Reageer -1 johnkeates @LCP • 30 oktober 2016 03:05 +1 Michaelr1 @johnkeates • 30 oktober 2016 06:07 Miljoenen mensen die windows gebruiken en dan denk je dat er amper iemand tussen zit die Kodi gebruikt? Reageer +1 Blackbird-ce @Michaelr1 • 30 oktober 2016 09:00 Eigenlijk wel... vroeger had iedereen ook ICQ, MSN, Trillian, ets geïnstalleerd op z'n Windows-machine, maar dergelijke IM-toepassingen zijn toch redelijk ver verschoven naar mobile devices. @johnkeates verwijst (denk ik) voornamelijk naar het draaien van Kodi op Raspberries en vergelijkbare apparatuur. Reageer +1 Michaelr1 @Blackbird-ce • 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Raspberry Pi's worden extreem veel gebruikt, maar het is voor de gemiddelde persoon nog lang niet weggelegd. Ik ken nog zat mensen (zelfs in de IT!) die een raspberry niet aandurven maar wel Kodi op hun Windows PC draaien. Zelfs IT'ers die Kodi niet aandurven... Voor mij is het allemaal heel erg normaal, zou me het ook amper kunnen voorstellen als ik die mensen niet kende Reageer 0 robbinwehl @Michaelr1 • 31 oktober 2016 08:30 IT'ers die een raspberry niet aandurven ? Elke mbo niveau 2 it'er zal toch een image op een sd moeten kunnen flashen. Reageer 0 Djerro123 @Michaelr1 • 30 oktober 2016 08:54 Zeg maar rustig miljarden mensen.. Reageer +1 Nelissuh @johnkeates • 30 oktober 2016 09:54 Zeker wel, ik draai Kodi onder Windows, op mijn HTPC in de woonkamer tenminste. Maar ook op een Pi op mijn slaapkamer, en ook op verschillende Android apparaten. Allemaal met bestanden en een database die centraal op een NAS staat, incl. DVB-C op alle apparaten beschikbaar met gedeelde PVR opslag (TvHeadend). Werkt perfect. Reageer 0 JUST_me @johnkeates • 30 oktober 2016 22:53 Super chill, een HTPC met hoge kwaliteit audio kaart met Kodi op mijn high end surround set. Prachtige beeld en geluidskwaliteit. Kodi is zeer veel verbeterd afgelopen jaren op voornamelijk audio gebied. Daarnaast, op mijn Surface pro 4 is Kodi ook een van de meest gebruikte programma's. Prima combi, Windows en Kodi. Reageer 0 JerX @johnkeates • 31 oktober 2016 13:27 Ik gebruik Kodi met Windows 10 als HTPC. Hier doe ik ook op browsen en zo nu en dan een spelletje. Gebruik voor de rest thuis ook geen Linux, maar alleen Windows. Overigens heb ik geen zin om Linux uit te leggen bij het vrouwtje, dus dit werkt prima. Ik weet overigens niet of Linux om kan gaan met een Bluray speler, maar mijn Windows gelukkig wel [Reactie gewijzigd door JerX op 31 oktober 2016 13:28] Reageer 0 LCP @johnkeates • 31 oktober 2016 17:40 En jij denkt niet dat mensen op hun desktop computer Kodi gebruiken zeker? Ik dus wel. Sterker nog, ik heb Kodi draaien op een Raspberry pi 1, 2 én mijn Windows desktop. Allemaal aan elkaar geknoopt via een MySQL database die draait op mijn Netgear NAS. Als ik boven op mijn computer even een serietje wil kijken, dan kan dat dus en wordt de watched status meteen aangepast in de database. Dus. Reageer 0 rootrulez @LCP • 31 oktober 2016 23:05 Waarom geen Plex gebruiken als ik vragen mag? Plex, tov Kodi, is juist bedoeld gebruik te maken van een centrale mediaserver/database waaraan je meerdere players knoopt. Ideaal icm Rasplex op de Pi, iOS devices, android devices, etc, etc. Reageer +1 Pepsichoco 30 oktober 2016 08:45 Kan iemand me eens uitleggen wat dat '10 bit' betekend ? Want ik zou denken dat video gewoon video en audio gewoon audio is. Het verschil tussen mono, stereo en 5.1/7.1 begrijp ik wel, maar is er iets wat er dan aan het beeld veranderd ? Sorry voor de misschien domme vraag voor sommigen, maar ik weet al langer dat er hier slimme mensen op tweakers zitten die het hier wel kunnen uitleggen. Bedankt alvast. Iedereen bedankt, het is me helemaal duidelijk geworden. [Reactie gewijzigd door Pepsichoco op 30 oktober 2016 15:01] Reageer +2 riesm @Pepsichoco • 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Kort door de bocht komt het op het volgende neer. Huidige tv's laten per primaire kleur 256 mogelijkheden toe (8 bits). Met 10 bits wordt dat verhoogd naar 1024 schakeringen per kleur. Op zich lijkt 256 al veel; als je ze echter naast elkaar zet (uiterst links komt waarde 0 en uiterst rechts waarde 255 met daartussen in de schakeringen), zal je zien dat dit op kleine schermen prima resultaat geeft. Op grote schermen zullen de overgangen van deze schakeringen steeds beter zichtbaar worden. Daar zit de winst naar 10-bit. Voorbeeld: http://forum.videohelp.co...hmentid=3774&d=1286525638 Overigens worden de meeste films met 12-bit opgenomen, dus vermoedelijk krijgen we in de nabije toekomst een nieuwe hype: 12-bit kleur. Reageer +1 Nelissuh @Pepsichoco • 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Beelschermen gebruiken 3 kleuren. RGB = Rood Groen en Blauw Standaard kleur op PC / TV = 8 bit = 28 kleuren = 256 kleurschakeringen per kanaal. 3 kanalen (Rood / Groen / Blauw) = 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,7 miljoen kleuren. Dat lijkt heel veel, maar als je alleen een blauwe lucht weer geeft, zijn er maar 256 tinten mogelijk, en kan je de overgangen tussen de kleuren zien (banding). 10 bit = 210 = 1024 kleurschakeringen per kanaal. dus van 8 -> 10 bit is in praktijk dus 4x zo veel kleurtinten per kanaal. Dit wordt vooral belangrijk bij HDR weergave. Bij HDR gaan de maxima van het kleurbereik per kanaal verder uit elkaar. Het meest maximale blauw wordt veel blauwer. Als je dit grotere gebied met 8 bit in 256 stappen blijft delen wordt het banding probleem nog veel groter. 10 bit lost dit probleem dan op. Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @Pepsichoco • 30 oktober 2016 09:44 Kort door de bocht; gaat om bits per kleur. Meer info, kun je vast wel Googlen. Je krijgt hierdoor meer kleurvarianten, doordat je de info opslaat in 10 bits ipv 8. https://youtu.be/Jcgg7jq1W3o https://youtu.be/bKjSox0uwnk [Reactie gewijzigd door CH40S op 30 oktober 2016 09:50] Reageer +1 Yarisken 29 oktober 2016 18:41 Hoeveel beta's gaan er nog komen :-). Kan echt niet wennen aan de nieuwe skin. Soit is een topproduct, ik zou niet meer zonder kodi kunnen. Staat hier elke avond op. Reageer +1 t0mt0m18 @Yarisken • 29 oktober 2016 21:56 @ Yarisken Maar is het dan niet vervelend dat je steeds weer je add-ons moet bijwerken enzo? Ik heb de afgelopen dagen een beetje geëxperimenteerd met Kodi, maar steeds als ik dan goede kanalen gevonden had waren die een dag later weer weg. Het kan nooit echt een betrouwbare mediaspeler worden op die manier toch? Althans, niet wanneer je ook live-streams en kanalen wilt kunnen ontvangen. Reageer +1 Yarisken @t0mt0m18 • 29 oktober 2016 22:55 Je hebt add-ons die al een tijd meegaan en die redelijk goed werken. Een voorbeeld. Mijn vrouw kijkt een serie op netflix en er staan 2 seizoenen op. Ze wil graag seizoen 3 zien. Dan schakel ik een add-on van kodi in. Met open-subtitles en een goeie add-on lukt dit perfect. Deze add-on worden gemaakt door liefhebbers dus als die ermee stoppen is het ook gedaan. Deze streams zijn dan ook illegaal evenals de add-on :-). Via "legale" add-ons in kodi kijk ik naar de video's van tweakers, dumpert, deredactie.be ( vlaamse tv zender ) etc... . Ik heb ook iptv dat ik bekijk via kodi. dik 2000+ kanalen van over heel de wereld ( betalend ). Earthcam is ook een leuke met cams van over heel de wereld. Reageer +1 Michaelr1 @t0mt0m18 • 30 oktober 2016 06:12 Daar is volgens mij Kodi niet voor bedoeld. Het is en blijft een mediaspeler en bibliotheek. De add-ons (subtitle/library add-ons niet meegerekend) zijn leuk, maar de reden van het succes van XBMC/Kodi ligt bij het customizen, hoge mate van compatibility en verkrijgbaarheid op alle denkbare platformen. Betrouwbaarder dan Kodi wordt het wat mij betreft niet. Alleen VLC heeft hogere compatibility. Reageer +1 FreshMaker @t0mt0m18 • 30 oktober 2016 18:16 @ Yarisken Maar is het dan niet vervelend dat je steeds weer je add-ons moet bijwerken enzo?

Het kan nooit echt een betrouwbare mediaspeler worden op die manier toch? Althans, niet wanneer je ook live-streams en kanalen wilt kunnen ontvangen.Het probleem is daar altijd met niet legale content. Dat kan van dag tot dag verdwijnen. De mediaspeler op zich werkt altijd, de basis addons ( ondertitels en informatie) updaten zichzelf op de achtergrond, daar is niets lastig aan. Reageer +1 Klojum @Yarisken • 29 oktober 2016 18:52 Zoveel betas als dat er nodig zijn, zolang de developers te kort door de bocht willen zoals deze keer. Je kunt in Kodi Krypton ook de Confluence skin installeren (of Xonfluence, met meer mogelijkheden) als je Estuary niks vindt. Reageer +1 Idiocracy @Klojum • 29 oktober 2016 21:36 Het is helemaal niet kort door de bocht gaan. De source code is gewoon spaghetti van oudsher en soms komt er gewoon wat onverwachts boven. Reageer +1 Dima_2005 @Yarisken • 29 oktober 2016 18:48 Ik vind de nieuwe skin net top. Elke keer als ik terug Kodi16 gebruik (dankzij openelec), wil ik gewoon terug naar Kodi17 Reageer 0 rootrulez @Dima_2005 • 31 oktober 2016 23:12 Hahaha, die avatar is prachtig!

Redelijk ouwbolig tov van wat plex, infuse etc tegenwoodig brengt. Reageer +1 ninjazx9r98 @Nikvdw • 30 oktober 2016 07:45 Dat is een kwestie van smaak en de skin van Kodi is wat mij betreft top (de voorgaande overigens ook) Oubollig en dergelijke boeit me niet zo veel, voor mij moet een skin vooral functioneel zijn en de rest is leuk maar meer ook niet. Plex heeft wat mij betreft overigens een draak van een interface (heel Plex is wat mij betreft een draak en overrated maar dat is een persoonlijke mening) en voor wat betreft oubollig zie ik niet direct wat daar nu zoveel beter/mooier aan is dan Kodi. Reageer +1 Nikvdw @ninjazx9r98 • 30 oktober 2016 09:01 Wat moet een media app meer doen dan content tonen en afspelen? kodi doet dat perfect, maar DS video en Plex doen het gewoon veel mooier (op de apple tv 4). Maar plex is geen optie voor mij omwille van de transcoding op mjn nas. Reageer +1 ninjazx9r98 @Nikvdw • 30 oktober 2016 10:04 Kodi draait op onze HTPC die met HDMI aan de receiver geknoopt is en ik zou werkelijk niet weten wat DS video en Plex daar mooier of beter aan (kunnen) doen? Overigens maakte jij de opmerking dat Kodi anno 2016 een fail is met een oubollige interface wat ik dan weer niet kan plaatsen bij je vraag wat een media app meer moet doen dan content tonen en afspelen. Reageer +1 Nikvdw @ninjazx9r98 • 30 oktober 2016 10:25 Ik heb ook jaren een htpc gehad met kodi. Niks verkeerd mee...toen. Nu gebruik ik een atv4 die gewoon alles voor zijn rekening neemt: eigen content (via kodi/ds video/infuse/plex), netflix, apps, games,... etc. In in deze setup (dus spreek ik voor mijn eigen situatie) is de kodi interface de vreemde eend in de bijt (ouboullig dus..) + de navigatie met de apple remote is bagger (tov native apps). Hopelijk gaat de nieuwe TV app die deze week is voorgesteld ooit kodi (of andere) ondersteunen. 1 (native) app voor all je content . Reageer +1 Mars Warrior @Nikvdw • 29 oktober 2016 21:12 Nu je Infuse neomt: sinds deze uit is gebruik ik heel Kodi niet meer. Behalve de fijne skin is voor mij de eenvoud van configuratie tov Kodi de belangrijste redenen voor deze overstap. Natuurlijk kan Kodi veel mee dan Infuse, maar ik gebruikte Kodi enkel voor het afspelen van films. Reageer +1 ASS-Ware @Nikvdw • 29 oktober 2016 22:28 Kodi altijd top gevonden maat de nieuwe skin is echt wel een fail ano 2016. Redelijk ouwbolig tov van wat plex, infuse etc tegenwoodig brengt.Je kan het oubollig noemen, maar dat kun je toch oplossen door een andere skin te gebruiken? Bovendien, Kodi kan een ISO openen en direct afspelen, kan Plex dat ook? Reageer 0 Nikvdw @ASS-Ware • 30 oktober 2016 08:58 Tbh, er zit niet veel deftig tussen. Daarbij ik gebruik MrMc op de ATV4 en daar valt het gewoon uit de toon en de ondersteuning voor de remote is ook maar bagger. Dus ik gebruik meer en meer DS Video van men NAS. Prachtige app. ISO support heb ik nooit nodig gehad. Reageer 0 ASS-Ware @Nikvdw • 30 oktober 2016 13:13 Tbh, er zit niet veel deftig tussen.

Reageer 0 Nikvdw @ASS-Ware • 30 oktober 2016 18:42 Weet ik wel, het is een gestripte versie van kodi om aan de apple app store regels te voldoen. (Add on support deleted etc). Maar de skin (confluence) blijft dezelfde he :-) Reageer 0 rootrulez @ASS-Ware • 31 oktober 2016 23:24 Ik kan het mij niet voorstellen dat iemand nog ISO files en DVD files gebruikt eerlijk gezegd.

I also want to thank CSIS for hosting this important conference, and I want to commend my Deputy Secretary of Defense – Bob – and General Paul Selva – guys, thanks for holding the fort down last week – for their leadership and hard work in leading the technology investment thrusts we call the Third Offset Strategy.  I’ll speak about that, but of course, in this speech I also want to speak about about innovation in all its dimensions – of which technological innovation is a piece, a very important piece.  Because being more innovative in every way we can is critical to the future success of our military and our Defense Department. Today, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, more innovative.  That’s why our military edge is second-to-none.  And it’s a fact every American ought to be proud of.  But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  And we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century – we have to earn it again and again.  And that’s what this is all about:  innovating to stay the best.  And I want to talk to you today about how we’re doing that in some different areas – our technology, our operations, our organization, and above all, our people. And right now it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a relentlessly changing, and fiercely competitive world.  There’s the faster pace of change, which sets up a fierce competition between the present and the future; competition with other nations, not only with us, but also with each other; and competition with terrorists and other malefactors for whom we are the game to beat – if they can – even if only in one place and at one time. Technology is one example of such change and competition that many of us have long been familiar with.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.  Today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  And much of the frontier of innovation is commercial, leading to additional sources of competitive dynamism outside our five walls. Against this background, your Defense Department is confronting a world security environment that’s also dramatically different than the last generation, and even the generation before that.  Indeed, the U.S. military is at this moment addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL – destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.  And at the same time as all of this, we’re preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges – we have to do them all.  And as the world changes and complexity increases, we’ll have to change, too – how to invest, how we fight, how we operate as an organization, and how we attract and nourish talent. As we do, we have to be able to move fast, because the advantages we expect to derive from each innovative cycle today will not last as long as they used to.  All the commercial and global change that’s occurred across the technology landscape has made repeated and rapid cycles necessary, and made high-end tech a lot more accessible to competitors.  Think about it.  While the Cold War arms race was characterized by the inexorable but steady accumulation of strength – with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons – today’s era of military competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else, and even change the game.  In the area of investment, it’s no longer just a matter of what we buy.  Now more than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, whom we buy them from, and how rapidly and creatively we can adapt them and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies technologically. That’s why I’ve been so intent as Secretary of Defense not only to plant the seeds for a number of different technologies that we think will be determinative in giving us a warfighting advantage for the future – more on those in a moment – but also to be more innovative and agile in all aspects of DoD:  in our operations, in our organization, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer forces. In each of these four areas, I – along with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Service Chiefs, all our excellent Combatant Commanders, and the Defense Department’s civilian leadership – have had a lot of help.  We’ve had help from Washington think tanks like CSIS, from our defense labs and industry partners, and also from many innovative Americans who understand the innovation imperative and who aren’t in our community now, but understand the need for our mission of national security and want to help.  And all of us have been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation. And I want to focus on that in the rest of my remarks – the clear strategic imperative we have to innovate in each area, how we’ve been innovating so far, and how we need to innovate going forward. Given the topic of this particular conference, I’ll start with technology. The strategic imperative to innovate technologically is well-known to those who’ve been paying attention, and that’s many of you here at CSIS.  Nations like Russia and China are trying to close the technology gap with the United States, and as I noted, high-end military technology has diffused – sometimes becoming available to countries like North Korea and Iran, as well as non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on technological systems like satellites and the Internet has grown, creating vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. To stay ahead of these threats, and to stay the best, we’re pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, robotics, undersea warfare, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and much, much more.  And I’ll repeat yet again, since it keeps coming up, that when it comes to using autonomy in our weapons systems, we will always have a human being in decision-making about the use of force. Now we’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed – a budget I strongly encourage Congress to pass when they return to Washington next month – will invest $72 billion in research and development in the next year alone.  That’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent last year on R&D combined. This budget marked a strategic turning point for the Department of Defense, with our Third Offset Strategy driving a wide range of new, innovative technological investments in order to advance and sharpen our military edge.  We’re making these investments because we aren’t yet exactly certain what, or where, this offset is going to come from – it could be one area of technology, or several.  Remember, previous offset strategies were generational successes, reflections of the security environment of their eras, and were only recognized as such after the fact.  Today, speed and agility are key, and because of the world we live in, the next offset will not look like previous ones.  And it may not even end up being what we might consider a traditional ‘offset’ strategy at all.  That’s why we’re seeding these investments in lots of different technologies – so we can see which ones germinate, how they develop, what they produce, and how we can use them most effectively. And in addition to these critical investments, it’s important to note how DoD is innovating technologically – how we’re innovating technologically – by creating technologies from within, by bringing in technology from without, and by repurposing technologies and capabilities we already have.  Because different entities are focused on each. Within the Defense Department, we have dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country – each one home to great technological innovators, both civilian and military, who work closely with a very innovative defense industry that’s long supported us and kept us on the cutting edge.  And they’re continuing to do so today, across a wide range of critical technologies.  For example, our Navy labs are developing and prototyping undersea drones in multiple sizes and with diverse payloads – which is important, since among other reasons unmanned undersea vehicles can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  Also, our Army labs are working on gun-based missile defenses, which can help defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round than more expensive interceptors – imposing higher costs on the attacker.  And our Air Force labs are pioneering applications for neuromorphic computing – that is, hardware, software, and systems inspired by the working mechanisms of the human brain – which offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current computing architectures, and enabling information superiority in air, space, and cyberspace. As I said, America’s innovative defense industry is a key partner in this – because, remember, we don’t build anything in the Pentagon.  That’s not the American way.  The Soviet Union tried that, and it didn’t work out very well for them.  Today, with more technological innovation happening in the commercial sector, we need to be able to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit as well as those within, and welcome them into our defense technology community.  That’s why last year I created our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – to help build bridges with startups and other commercial technology firms located in innovation ecosystems across the United States, and help us more quickly adopt technologies that can help our troops accomplish their missions.  DIUx opened its doors last August with a West Coast office in Silicon Valley, and since then, we iterated and launched DIUx 2.0 in May, and opened a DIUx East Coast office in Boston, and established an outpost in Austin, Texas.  One important area where DIUx recently solicited proposals is in micro-satellites and advanced analytics – leveraging the revolution in commercial space and machine learning to transform how we use space-based tools and advanced data processing to provide critical situational awareness to forces around the world.  And it also adds resilience, by the way, to our national space architecture. Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO, we’re also changing and adapting how we use existing platforms and technologies already in our inventory – giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  As some of you know, I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense – putting Will Roper, by the way, in charge of it, Will – and earlier this year, I lifted the veil on several of its projects that we’re investing in, such as the arsenal plane, a new anti-ship capability for the SM-6 missile, and swarming drones on the sea and in the air.  In fact, this technology took a large step forward just this week.  You’ll be hearing more about that in the months to come A prominent theme of SCO’s work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions across varied domains.  One example of this I want to highlight – it’s something that we haven’t talked about publically before today – is SCO’s project to develop a cross-domain capability for the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.  By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they’re enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land.  With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.* Going forward, as these and other investments yield new weapons systems and warfighting capabilities in the coming years – some of them much sooner than you might think – they’ll need to be demonstrated so that they’re effective in deterring future conflict.  And it will be important to ensure they are allowed to run their course.  We have to protect the most promising, and integrate those concepts and ideas into our programs, rather than let them be uprooted just because they’re new – which is always a tendency in tight budgets. Of course, how we use technology is just as important as the technology itself, if not more, which is why we’re also investing aggressively in operational innovation.  Our plans and operations must account not only for the evolving challenges we face from our competitors, but also the opportunities afforded by new capabilities as they come on line – so technological and operational innovation must go hand-in-glove. Here, the strategic imperative is rooted in the fact that while we’ve spent the last 15 years innovating expertly – and I’m very proud of it – in how we kill terrorists and counter insurgencies, we did so to some extent at the expense of our expertise in full-spectrum warfighting.  Other nations have gotten good at that over the years, and in some cases they’ve been devising new methods to try to counter our advantages and pre-empt us from being able to respond – not just by developing high-tech weapons, but also by crafting operational approaches such as hybrid warfare techniques. For these reasons, we’ve been reinvigorating our training across the services to return to full-spectrum readiness, and we’ve been re-thinking how we operate to find new advantages against potential adversaries – including by changing and adapting how we might fight with friends and allies.  For example, in Europe, we’ve been working with our NATO allies to adapt and write a new playbook for our Strong and Balanced strategic approach to Russia – one that takes the lessons of history and leverages our alliance’s strengths in new, networked ways to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare; to integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence; and to adjust our posture and presence so we can be more agile and responsive.  And in the Asia-Pacific, we’ve been modernizing our alliances, strengthening new partnerships, and helping to build a Principled and Inclusive regional Security Network. This rubber meets the road in how we’re revising our actual plans for potential operations themselves.  Now, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational concepts to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, but we’ve also updated our core contingency plans to make sure they apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  And at the same time that we innovate in our plans to counter these conventional threats, we’re also ensuring that – with respect to potential confrontations with nuclear powers – we continue to sustain America’s nuclear deterrent as we recapitalize our nuclear triad and infrastructure.  Overall, we’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners take into account how to prevail if they have to execute their plan at the same time another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into a trap of presuming the one they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  We’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we have to be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them.  And we’re prioritizing transregional and transfunctional integration in our plans – which is an imperative considering that conflict doesn’t segment anymore, and the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  This was one of the Goldwater-Nichols reforms I proposed here at CSIS nearly seven months ago, and it will be coordinated on my behalf by our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford – whom, by the way, we’re very fortunate to have in his job.  Recommending him to President Obama was one of the best decisions I’ve made as Secretary of Defense. The result of this is that we’ve revised all of our war plans to ensure we have the agility and ability to win the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future.  And while I can’t say more – and if any audience can appreciate why, a CSIS audience can – I’ll tell you that I’m very proud of this evolving family of plans. Now, innovation in technology and in operations are necessary for us, but they’re not sufficient – because at the pace today’s world demands, we can only succeed in these by being an agile organization that nurtures innovation in all its forms.  So we’re also investing in innovative organizational structures and practices. The strategic imperative here is that DoD must be an organization that better fosters innovative thinking and ideas that can help us to stay ahead of our competitors.  The Defense Department is one of the largest organizations in the world, and as many of you know well, we can be pretty bureaucratic and slow-moving, where it’s easy to default to the status quo of continuing to do things the same way we’ve always done them.  But we can’t afford that in today’s security environment – we need to be a place where thinking differently is welcomed and fostered, not where good ideas go to die just because they happen to be new. Over the last few years, I’ve created a number of entities to help signify and drive innovation throughout DoD – including SCO, DIUx, and the Defense Digital Service.  And I most recently created the Defense Innovation Board, to advise me and future leadership on how we can keep growing more competitive.  As you know, the Defense Innovation Board is one of several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise.  The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served – and which, by the way, we’re grateful that John Hamre chairs – has a membership with exceptional foreign and defense policymaking experience.  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoD’s vast business enterprise and practices.  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role – its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches that have worked in their leadership experience, and that might be applicable to us.  The Innovation Board is chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and its membership represents a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, Mike McQuade from United Technologies, and retired Admiral Bill McRaven, now chancellor of the University of Texas.  And I’ve charged them and the rest of the board to help keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation – to support innovators themselves, the people in our defense enterprise who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of our competitors. At the outset, I gave them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in DoD, along the lines of our Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which invited hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already routinely conduct.  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first time in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful, we’re now expanding it to other parts of DoD.  This is the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Innovation Board – things that are out there and that might be useful to us. Now, of course, not everything in the private sector will make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s dedicated to the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn, and ways we can operate more effectively.  The Defense Innovation Board held its first public meeting earlier this month and made some preliminary recommendations to me and the public about some innovative practices that might make sense for us to adopt.  And today I want to tell you about several that I’ve decided we’re going to do. First, we’re going to increase our focus on recruiting talented computer scientists and software engineers into our force, both military and civilian.  We’ll do this through targeted recruiting initiatives ranging from our Reserve Officer Training Corps to our civilian scholarship-for-service program that’s intended to help build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders – all with the goal of making computer science a core competency of the department. Second, we’re going to invest more broadly in machine learning, through targeted challenges and prize competitions, and not through a new brick-and-mortar institution, but rather through a ‘virtual center of excellence’ model that establishes stretch goals and incentivizes academic and private-sector researchers to achieve them.  Since this is an area where both the academy and commercial technology companies have been making significant strides, I’ve asked DIUx to pilot this approach by sponsoring an initial prize challenge focused on computer vision and machine learning. And third, we’re going to create a DoD Chief Innovation Officer, who will act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and will serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, including but not limited to those suggested by the Defense Innovation Board – such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD at scale, sponsoring innovation contests and tournaments, and providing training and education that promotes new ideas and approaches to collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.  Many different organizations have recently embraced this position, and also started to regularly run these kind of innovation tournaments and competitions – including tech companies like IBM, Intel, and Google – and it’s time we did as well, to help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches, and be recognized for them. Going forward, I’m confident that the logic behind everything I’m talking about today will be self-evident to future defense leadership, as will the value of these efforts – but they also need to have the momentum and institutional foundation to keep going under their own steam and to continue to thrive.  We must ensure that we keep leading the way, and keep disrupting, challenging, and inspiring all of us to change for the better. And this brings me, finally, to how we’re innovating in terms of our people, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force.  While it’s the last area of innovation I’m going to discuss today, it’s also the most important – because the fact is, our people are the source of every innovative thing we’ve ever done, are doing, or will do.  Indeed, much more than our technology, operations, and organization, our people are the key to us having the finest fighting force – in our uniformed military, in our DoD civilian workforce, and in the defense industry that supports us.  And that means we need to compete for good people as far into the future as we can. Now the good news is, there’s lots of opportunity here, as well as new techniques and technologies in talent management – such as the kind of advanced data analytics that underpin companies like LinkedIn.  But there are also challenges we face – in terms of the limitations of our current technology in the human resources area, and as generations and labor markets change.  Even so – so even as our force of today is outstanding – we must ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer in future generations of defense.  And that’s why we’ve been taking step after step to build what I call the Force of the Future.  I’ve announced four different ‘links’ so far to the Force of the Future.  The first focused on building and increasing on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions – creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and more.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or a project.  And it will also allow more of DoD and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – of which there are many – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovative ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about, working with defense. Next, the Force of the Future’s second link focused on increasing retention among our ranks through increased support to our military families.  It’s often said that when you recruit a servicemember, you retain a family; after all, it’s no secret that military life is difficult, and can be especially tough on our military families.  And let me remind you that our force is largely a married one, with about 70 percent of officers and 50 percent of enlisted who are married.  Now, we can’t change the fundamentals of military service, but we can make some changes to make life easier for our married people – and increase the possibility that they’ll want to stay at that critical moment when they’re trying to reconcile military life and family life.  That’s why we expanded maternity and paternity leave, why we extended childcare hours on bases, and why we’re giving more families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional service commitments. After that, the third link to the Force of the Future focused on how we can make some common-sense improvements to military talent management – particularly for our officer corps.  In some cases, our current system proves too rigid.  It can limit the ability of our services to achieve the right force mix they need, especially at a time when we’re seeking to promote a wider range of experience, perspective, and training to strengthen the overall effectiveness of the force.  That’s why we want to give the military services the authority to do things like expand lateral entry for more specialties and adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance. And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future made clear that this is not only about our military, but also about our civilian workforce.  When people talk about DoD civilians, they’re talking about over 700,000 talented Americans serving across the country and around the world.  More than 85 percent of them live outside of the DoD – D.C., excuse me – the D.C. area.  They fix aircraft, they operate shipyards and ranges, and more.  They do critical jobs, and without them DoD wouldn’t function.  So the goal here is the same as with our military personnel:  to make sure our future civilian workforce is just as great as the one we have today, in several ways – by directly hiring civilian employees from college campuses, by creating a new two-way civilian talent exchange program with the private sector, by expanding our scholarship-for-service program in mission-critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, and more. Also, in addition to each of these links, over the last year we opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now draw on 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force – focusing purely on a person’s willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission, and giving everyone the full and equal opportunity to do so. Going forward, there will still be much more work to do – and you’ll soon be hearing from me more about the Force of the Future.  But these links span the spectrum of our opportunities, our challenges, and the lifetime of a member of our all-volunteer force – recruitment, retention, development, transition – and also our valuable civilian workforce.  And for the first time in a long time, DoD’s Personnel and Readiness office has a real, proactive agenda – a concrete action plan to guide its efforts, so that they’re doing more than just being reactive belatedly to issues that crop up.  And based on support for these efforts that I’m seeing in the military services and across our department, I’m confident that the implementation of all these initiatives will continue moving forward, and ensure that the Force of the Future is as great as the force of today. I’ve described today a lot of ways the Department of Defense is changing and will continue to change in the future, but I want to close by reminding all of you, all of DoD, and all of America that as we sit here this morning, our country’s strengths are undeniable.  We have the best military, of course – spanning our people, our investments, our dedication to the mission, and the public support we receive from the American people – but there’s much more than that.  Our economy is growing.  We have world-class schools and universities.  We uphold the right values, which is one reason why we have an unrivaled network of friends and allies.  Meanwhile the operational experience of our force – hard-earned – is second-to-none.  And we have the greatest innovative culture on the planet.  When we’ve brought that innovative culture to bear in service of others – that is, to defend our country and help make a better world for our children – it’s long been America’s open military secret.  And we remain dedicated to doing so, and it can be so.  We have a legacy of innovating, but that in itself is not enough.  That’s why we’re moving aggressively toward a more innovative future, and why everything I’ve talked about today is intended to ensure exactly that.  Going forward, our success will depend on whether we can keep it up. Like its predecessors, the next wave of innovation and advantage will be a generational success – and it’s only just beginning.  We probably don’t even know yet the names of the people who will make it a reality.  More likely than not, it won’t be by me or anyone from my generation.  Instead, it’ll be the generation that comes after. It’ll be junior officers and DoD civilians fresh out of graduate school – some of them here today, perhaps – who decide to spend a year outside of the department at Google or somewhere else, and work with an expert in data science or machine learning.  It’ll be the software engineers and bioscientists who get to know our mission by working with one of our DIUx outposts, and then choose to do a tour of duty in the Defense Digital Service or working at one of our DoD labs. It’ll be the enlisted soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who come up with new operational concepts for overcoming potential adversaries using advanced technologies that may not even exist yet, or defeating a terrorist group we haven’t heard of. They’re the ones – they’re the ones – who will end up reinventing and changing anew how we will deter, fight, and win wars in the future.  Our job is to give them the foundation, the right kind of Pentagon to help them succeed:  one that’s more agile and innovative than ever before.  As long as we do, they will ensure – like those who came before them – that our military remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Thank you. [*Please note, due to an unfortunate error, the following paragraphs were omitted from this speech.] DIUx and SCO share the characteristics of speed and agility, which has long been a focus of mine.  When I served as Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was imperative that we quickly get our troops in harm’s way the tools they needed to accomplish their mission.  We started the Warfighter Senior Integration Group, which is designed to bring together and bring to bear the full weight of the Defense Department’s senior leadership on addressing our most critical operational needs.  And we established a “fast lane” to rapidly field cutting-edge, much-needed capabilities, like mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and inexpensive aerostat balloons equipped with cameras to help monitor the security of our forward operating bases.  Ultimately this evolved into what we in the Pentagon today call Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs) – or the things we need right away for fighting the wars we’re in now – and Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs) – the things we need as soon as possible for a conflict that could start tomorrow.  As I’ve said before, the system is far from perfect, but it has injected some badly needed agility into the Pentagon’s notoriously slow bureaucracy – agility that I’ve been determined to enhance as Secretary of Defense.  And DIUx and SCO build on this legacy with their focus on quickly meeting the near-term needs of not only today’s, but also tomorrow’s warfighter.

 Don’t buy the MacBook Air Jeff Dunn Oct. 29, 2016, 9:00 AM 81,493 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple rolled out three new MacBook Pros last month. They look interesting! Especially when it comes to that multifunctional Touch Bar that lives above the keyboards on the two higher-end models. They're also expensive. The most affordable new model starts $1,499, and doesn’t include the Touch Bar. The other 13- and 15-inch models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. Lots of people don’t want to pay that. But lots of people also want a Mac. That could make the cheapest MacBook model Apple now sells, the 13-inch MacBook Air, seem appealing. After all, if you look at Apple’s Mac page, it’s now the only notebook that’s available for less than $1,000. Note that the "MacBook Pro 13-inch" on the right isn't the newest model. A little confusing!Apple That said, you shouldn't buy it. Though there’s always a certain allure to buying an Apple product, you can get better for your dollar in late 2016. It’s been more than 600 days since the MacBook Air received a significant refresh. (Apple quietly updated the base model from 4GB of RAM to 8GB this past April, but that’s it.) The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not a one-to-one update is coming, but considering how it pitched the Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro as superior to the Air on Thursday, you probably shouldn’t hold your breath. In any case, that age shows today. What was once a significant leap forward for notebook design has been surpassed on all fronts. There are several thinner and lighter laptops available now. Their bezels are slimmer to boot. Flickr/Tim Trueman The entry-level MacBook Air runs on a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 chip. For a few hundred dollars more, you can go up to a stronger 2.2GHz Core i7 processor. Both of those processors sound fine, and for the most part they are, but they’re the 5th-generation “Broadwell” chips Intel launched in 2015. We’re on the 7th generation (“Kaby Lake”) now. That doesn’t mean the Air can't do most everyday tasks. Much like the iPhone and iOS, the MacBook can get more out of lesser specs because Apple intertwines hardware and software so tightly. But it’s still not great. “Fine” is not what you want when you’re shelling out $1,000 for a new computer. It’s a matter of futureproofing. You don’t buy a laptop for today — you buy it for three or four years down the road. In 2019, you’ll want a Kaby Lake or Skylake (the 6th-gen chip found in the most recent MacBook Pros) machine more than a Broadwell one. Worse, the Air is notoriously stubborn about letting you upgrade other components like the RAM or hard drive. Reuters/Robert Galbraith Along those same lines, the MacBook Air has no USB-C ports. While we’ll all miss Apple’s old MagSafe connector dearly, there’s a reason why the company put four of these things on its new MacBook Pros: It’s very obviously where all laptops are headed. It’s where all non-iPhone smartphones are headed too. It’s faster, it’s more versatile, and most future accessories are going to use it. Unless you’re on a budget, it’s a must-have today. The worst offender, though, is the MacBook Air’s display. With a resolution of 1440x900, it is simply not up to par for a $1,000 laptop in 2016. There are notebooks that cost less than $600 with sharper screens, letting you see more things at once. Resolution isn’t everything, but even then, the Air’s colors, brightness, and viewing angles are all just decent by today’s standards. Full disclosure: I look at it everyday for work. It's just not enough. Flickr/Matthew Pearce To be clear, the MacBook Air isn’t a bad laptop. It’s sturdily built, its battery is great, its keyboard is above-average, and its trackpad is second-to-none. It’s just a laptop from 2015. If any other company launched it for $1,000 or more today, it’d be roundly ignored. Everyone else has caught up. This makes it all the more frustrating that Apple opted not to update the device last month. The way to make the MacBook Air appealing again seems simple: Refresh the processor, and update the screen to full HD. There is a big, vocal group of people who do not want to adjust to the super-thin keyboard on the new Pro models. But Apple is a business, and updating the Air would likely cut into the margins made by the iPad Pro and the new MacBook Pros. Yes, that new MacBook Pro looks and feels fantastic. For now, though, if you don’t want to pay that kind of premium, it’s time to leave Mac behind. Try a Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth, HP Spectre x360, or — if you’re really strapped for cash — Asus Zenbook UX305UA instead.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version October 29, 2016 - 14:16 AMT SHARE Armenia announces winner of presidential award for IT development A press conference announcing the winner of the Annual Award of the Armenian President For Outstanding Contribution to Global IT for the year 2016 took place at the Presidential Palace. The event was presided over by Chairman of GIT Award Committee and Chief of Staff to the President Armen Gevorgyan, Ralph Yirikian, the General Manager of VivaCell-MTS - the Company-sponsor of GIT Award - Hovik Musaelyan, Chairman of Executive Board of GIT Award, and Tony Moroyan, Representative of the Award Selection Panel, the CEO and Chairman of Viasphere International. For 2016, the inventor of datagram and founder of Open-Root organization Louis Pouzin, who is also known as one of the founding fathers of the Internet, will receive the presidential award. The Global IT Award is granted on an annual basis to an individual, whose internationally acclaimed contributions to IT have resulted in near-revolutionary or revolutionary developments that have positively impacted or hold the potential to positively impact the humanity. The speakers highlighted the importance of the Award for the development of Armenian ICT Sector and promoting the country’s image internationally. GIT Award is held in Armenia for already seven years, hosting outstanding professionals from around the world once a year. Armenia hosted the following giants in previous years: the retired CEO/ Chairman of the Board of Intel Corporation, Craig Barrett in 2010, co-founder of Apple Computers, Inc. Steve Wozniak in 2011, Chairman Emeritus of Synaptics, Inc. Federico Faggin in 2012, President of the Society of Semiconductor Industry Specialists, President of Techno Vision consulting firm Tsugio Makimoto in 2013, Senior Vice President and General Manager for the Insieme Business Unit at Cisco Mario Mazzola in 2014, and Chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab. Eugene Kaspersky in 2015. VivaCell-MTS has supported the GIT Award during the whole period of its existence, having donated AMD 144.2 million for the realization of the program. The Company’s support to the award from the very beginning is based on its vision of Armenia’s future – a country with internationally competitive ICT sector. The Company contributes to this national objective in synergy with impactful projects implemented at a national level. Apart from positioning Armenia and promoting it internationally as a country having achievements and a huge, yet-unrealized potential in the development of ICT, and opportunities for investment in the sector, the Award also has a great role to play internally. The GIT award is stimulating the attractiveness of ICT sector as a professional choice among the Armenian youth. Each visit by a laureate to the country, followed by awarding and lecture by a prominent leader in the sphere of Information Technologies, is a serious promotion of the ICT for the younger generation. “The sphere of Information and Communication Technologies is one of the key directions of Armenia’s economic development, and the Award of the President has a great importance in terms of promoting Armenia. Time will pass, and internationally acclaimed figures in the sphere of IT will arrive in Armenia, increasing the awareness about our country as one that relies on its intellectual potential,” said Gevorgyan. “We are confident that the gurus, who have received this honorary award, will return to Armenia in coming years, bringing with them contemporary culture of high technologies and boosting Armenia’s image around the world as a country relying on intellect and knowledge,” said Musaelyan. In addition to supporting the GIT Award, VivaCell-MTS has been supporting numerous projects in ICT sector with the amount of social investment in the sphere totaling AMD 953.6 million. “The award is a powerful tool aimed at showing our achievements in the sphere of ICT to the world and strengthening the country’s image,” Yirikian commented. “I’m proud that we have managed to bring about the visit of IT legends to Armenia and we hope to repeat it this year,” said Moroyan.

Pictures by Prashant Mitra Ranchi police claim to have activated their intelligence network to nab the two youths who shot at and injured a 20-year-old student on her way to college on Thursday morning. The SSP's order to expedite investigations into the attack on Sima Kumari, a resident of Lohratoli and Hindi honours student at Maulana Azad College, comes a day after Pundag thana outpost OC Rakesh Kumar Singh was suspended for not following up on her August complaint against the local land mafia. City SP Kishore Kaushal said simultaneous probe had begun into the August 12 firing on Sima's house and Thursday's attack. "Raids are being carried out in Pundag for Shiva Munda and Munna Munda, residents of Marang Serang, whom the victim has named in her FIR twice. Intel has been activated and we raided several places since last (Thursday) night," the officer said, not willing to divulge police plans any further. SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi had acted tough against Pundag OC Singh, charged with dereliction of duty and indiscipline, within hours of Sima taking a bullet in her left arm. "Md Farooq will replace Singh as the officer-in-charge of Pundag outpost. Singh has been attached to the district police headquarters. During the suspension period, he will only be entitled to a sustenance allowance," SP Kaushal said. Sima, recuperating at RIMS, said for the first time, since the land mafia laid eyes on her ancestral acres, she felt police were on her side. "I had a providential escape despite being shot at from close range. Land sharks have been terrorising us for months and our complaints were ignored even after our home was targeted by gun-toting men. I am glad that action has been taken against the police officer who did not act against the rogue land brokers," she said, adding that she had written against the OC to the DGP and IG, besides district police brass. Sima is the daughter of rickshaw-puller Bodho Sahu and Kaushalya Devi, and the youngest among five sisters and a brother. The family owns an acre and 69 decimals of land in Pundag, 10km from the capital, which land broker Manoj Munda had grabbed with the help of his musclemen. The broker was shot dead in Nagri in July following which Sima's elder brother Panchanan Kumar was arrested on the basis of suspicion. DSP Sadar Vikas Chandra Srivastava said Sima had lodged an FIR after the August attack on her house, but OC Singh did not act. "That emboldened the accused to make an attempt on the life of the complainant. The department has taken the matter seriously. For dereliction of duty, wantonness and indiscipline, the officer has been suspended till further orders," Srivastava added.  More stories in Jharkhand LICENCE TO CHAOS Tinderbox shops ignore fire safety Tricolour backdrop for tallest Kali Revelry minus risks Diwali films tame, so is Sena stir Special athletes bring cheer Inching closer to piped water Campaign for Canary with click collection Burglary at retired judge's flat Lighting up love & harmony National pat for BIT boy Bokaro splurges, cops watch An arm, two wheels & country roads Shop target, booty Rs 25 lakh Special train for Chhath CM Das launches PM road projects Dhoni's brand shoot Food Smashing wins by kps, narbheram Gifts galore to dim Chinese dazzle PLFI leader gives up for wife, daughter Medal moment    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

The certification will help to ensure that all WiGig-branded devices, which have been around for some time, can flawlessly operate with each other and deliver expected multi-gigabit performance over 60 GHz spectrum. The WiGig technology (IEEE 802.11ad) is a short range communication standard that enables compatible devices to communicate at up to 7–8 Gb/s data rates and with minimal latencies, using the 60 GHz spectrum at distances of up to ten meters. Since 60 GHz signals cannot penetrate walls, the technology can be used to connect devices that are in direct line of sight. Given the limitation, WiGig cannot replace Wi-Fi or even Bluetooth, but it can enable devices like wireless docking stations, wireless AR/VR head-mounted displays, wireless high-performance storage devices, wireless displays, and others devices which need a lot of bandwidth. To date, Intel and Qualcomm have released several tri-band chipsets that support the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz spectrums as well as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and WiGig technologies. The Wi-Fi Alliance has already certified Intel’s Tri-Band Wireless 18260 (Maple Peak) and Qualcomm’s QCA9500 802.11ad-compatible chipsets as well as multiple devices that use them (including Dell’s Latitude E7450/70 as well as 802.11ad 60 GHz USB adapters from Peraso and Socionext). Going forward, the organization will certify other products, including smartphones and docking stations. It should be noted that the start of WiGig certification on its own isn't going to be the catalyst to cause WiGig adoption to take off, but it will increase chipset developers', device makers', and end users' confidence in the standard. Designers of Wi-Fi chipsets and manufacturers of actual systems have been reluctant to adopt 802.11ad so far because the infrastructure is absent and so is demand, a classic chicken and egg dilemma. With the official certification process things will likely get a little better, mainly because of added confidence. Meanwhile, analysts from ABI Research believe that 180 million of WiGig-enabled chipsets will ship inside smartphones already next year with 1.5 billion WiGig devices shipping in 2021.

If you want 1GBps speeds you are going to have to harass Congress to stop with the allowing de-facto monopolies, mandating linesharing, and get some true competition into the markets of the United States. Reply marvdmartian - Wednesday, November 02, 2016 - link But that would require Congress to turn down the (no doubt) large "political contributions" they receive, from those very same monopolistic internet service provider companies (cable, phone, satellite, etc), that are paid to ensure they don't meddle in their business, wouldn't it? Might make it a bit more difficult for some of our elected officials to become millionaires, while in office, darn it! Reply Oxford Guy - Tuesday, November 08, 2016 - link Princeton and Northwestern researchers have proven that Congress completely ignores what 90% of the public wants. Don't assume they pay attention much to the lower part of that top 10% either.

Apple tells us that it has a built-in image signal processor (ISP) related to the ones Apple uses in iPhone and iPad SoCs, something which Troughton-Smith suggests could protect the camera from malware hijacking. And its Secure Enclave handles the encryption and storage of fingerprint data and protects it from the rest of the operating system and its apps, much as it does in iOS. When you interact with the Touch Bar, Apple tells us that the majority of the processing is being done by the Intel CPU, although the T1 also appears to do some processing in specific situations for security’s sake, as when Apple Pay is used. But to keep the Touch Bar from counting toward the number of external monitors you can use (Intel’s GPUs support a total of three separate displays, AMD’s support six), the T1 is used to drive the Touch Bar’s screen. From what Apple told me, it sounds like the image you’re seeing is actually being drawn by the main system GPU but is being output to the display by T1, not unlike the way other hybrid graphics implementations work. Between A-series chips, the W1, and the T1, Apple's most fascinating work is happening in the custom silicon space. The whole T1-Touch Bar deal is extremely intriguing.

IBM employees on an assembly line for the Ramac, the first computer with a hard drive, on August 29, 1959, in San Jose, California. [Photo: Getty Images/Bettmann/Contributor] Harry McCracken 10.28.16 4:00 PM Next week, IBM is formally opening Watson West—a San Francisco outpost for its Watson "cognitive technology" platform, which the company is training to help everyone from doctors to merchants make smarter decisions. Occupying three floors of a gleaming office building in San Francisco’s startup-heavy South of Market neighborhood, the office includes both space for employees involved in the Watson effort and a slick demo center where IBM can whip up enthusiasm among third-party developers, prospective customers, and other outsiders. Watson West is, in part, a statement about IBM’s desire to embed itself in the San Francisco Bay Area tech community. But it’s also less of a striking departure than the latest chapter in a long story. IBM may be the archetypal big East Coast tech company, but it's understood the benefits of being at home in the Bay Area for decades, dating back to the era when it was a manufacturer of automation equipment, and the computer was still in the process of being invented. Watson West IBM long ago shifted its emphasis from big iron to software and services. With Watson, it's a key player in the race to use machine-learning technology to train computers to understand big data in an array of fields—an industry trend that, in one way or another, has also swept up everybody from Google to Facebook to Microsoft to Apple. "IBM has a lead on this, having started a couple of decades ago," says Watson General Manager David Kenny, who is still a newcomer to IBM, having joined the company when it closed its acquisition of his former employer, the Weather Company, in January. Computer scientists at the IBM Research-Almaden lab in San Jose were part of the AI research that made Watson possible in the first place and are helping to chart its future. Now, with Watson West, the company has a presence "at the top of the [San Francisco] peninsula as well as the bottom," Kenny says. That's particularly important as Watson becomes the foundation for capabilities that can be commercially deployed in specific business sectors—a process that frequently involves startups who build on top of IBM's work. "Many of those companies are on the West Coast and funded by VCs on the West Coast," says Kenny. David Kenny Helping such companies work with IBM with as little friction as possible is key to Watson fulfilling its potential. "People can always travel, and people will travel for the most important relationships," says Slack cofounder Stewart Butterfield, whose startup announced this week that it was partnering with IBM to let third-party developers build Slack chatbots powered by Watson intelligence. What you lose with distance is the ability to participate in forms of collaboration and community such as hackathons without giving it a second thought. "You can fly out over and over again for that kind of stuff, or you can be in the Bay Area and catch the action," Butterfield says. (In the case of the IBM-Slack collaboration, Slack happens to have search and intelligence staffers based in New York, which let them commute by foot to Watson headquarters in the city's Astor Place neighborhood, eight blocks away. But some meetings—including ones involving Butterfield—took place in San Francisco.) In The Beginning When IBM first put down roots in Silicon Valley in 1943, the area was known for its bounteous orchards, not technology. The company bought a 34,000-square-foot factory in San Jose and began manufacturing punch cards for its tabulating machines. (The computer industry didn’t exist yet, though IBM was at work on research that helped create it.) "Our decision to establish a plant on the Pacific coast is based not only on the large amount of business that we now have in the territory, but on our belief that after the war, the Pacific coast will be a far greater industrial district than ever before," explained legendary CEO Thomas J. Watson Sr. It would take decades before it was clear just how prescient he was. In 1952, the company added to its San Jose presence with a lab based in the city’s downtown area. Four years later, one of the industry’s landmark achievements happened there when a small team of researchers invented the hard drive, which the company used as part of an accounting computer called the 305 RAMAC. The 305 RAMAC, a 1950s room-sized IBM computer, was designed and built in San Jose.[Photo: Wikipedia] At about the same time, as part of a push to raise its profile on the West Coast, the company broke ground on an ambitious, innovative 190-acre research/manufacturing operation located on land formerly devoted to walnut groves. In 2014, I wrote about this prototypical Silicon Valley corporate campus, including the strange story of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev's visit in 1959. (He was more impressed by the cafeteria than the computers.) In 1986, IBM Research’s San Jose arm moved into its current home, IBM Research–Almaden. Judged purely on the surrounding natural splendor—rolling hills, parks, and preserves—it may have the most beautiful setting I’ve ever seen for a tech-company office. But the location, at the southern end of San Jose, is not exactly convenient to the rest of Silicon Valley. You need to do a fair amount of driving to get to Intel (20 miles to the north), Apple (21 miles), Google (26 miles), and Facebook (33 miles). That locale—proximity to the Valley's ecosystem, but not too much proximity—is intentional, even though many of its biggest players didn’t exist back in 1986 when the Almaden office opened. "When the labs were first started, the idea was to place them near strong academic centers and strong centers of business and commerce, but not right in the middle of them, necessarily," says Jeff Welser, the IBM VP who heads the Almaden operation. The original research center in Yorktown Heights, for instance, is about 40 minutes north of New York City. IBM Research-Almaden in all its atmospheric splendor. "We wanted to be close enough in that we can interact and take advantage of everything there, but separated enough that we can actually also do our work in our own area," says Welser. "Think deep thoughts, as our founder would say. In fact, actually at lunchtime, you'll see people literally walking a loop around this lab because you get a beautiful view of the valley." Jeff Welser The Almaden building does feel like a refuge where gifted scientists can squirrel up in their offices and put their brainpower to work without distraction, though it's hardly antisocial. (An open area called THINKlab is specifically designed to facilitate collaboration between IBM clients and researchers with various areas of expertise.) IBM Research's rich legacy testifies to the approach's success. "Historically speaking, large corporate research organizations have had varying kinds of success," says Guru Banavar, VP of cognitive computing. "I would say IBM corporate research has been the most successful in terms of scale and impact." As the official IBM Research-Almaden timeline indicates, the facility’s three decades of history are a chronology of what was important to the company at any given point in time. Data—how to store it, retrieve it, and make it useful—has been an ongoing theme. In 1970, the relational database was invented there. In 1988, its researchers created a standard for speedier data recording on a disk. In 1998, as mobile devices gained in importance, the lab developed the Microdrive, a tiny hard disk. And in 2002, it proposed a database designed with protecting the privacy of personal data in mind. Today, "If I had to sum up in a nutshell what this lab does," says Welser, "it's all about using data to expand what the human mind can do. That really is in essence what cognitive computing is about." Despite IBM Research-Almaden's scholarly air, people are drawn here in part by the opportunity to create things that will be turned into businesses. "If you are someone who really wants to do academic research, you want to be a professor, you want to teach the next generation of students, a university is the right place to go." Welser says. "But if you want to be able to do deep research and have that get translated rapidly into something in a very broad portfolio of potential application areas, that's the kind of person that really likes IBM Research." Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly. Some of the most wildly ambitious of those efforts—ones of the sort that Google would call moonshots—are instigated by IBM's Grand Challenges program. Watson itself originated as a Grand Challenge, back when the notion of training a computer to play Jeopardy better than a human champion sounded—at least to those of us who aren't among the world's savviest computer scientists—to be downright fanciful. That challenge was met. And now IBM researchers are leveraging Watson to tackle feats that could be far more meaningful than providing questions for Alex Trebek's answers. Welser defines a Grand Challenge as "something that, at this point, we don’t know if we can do or not, but if we could do it, it would make a huge difference to us, to our clients, to the world." One such project, dubbed "the Medical Sieve," aims to use cognitive-computing technology to analyze radiology images for signs of abnormalities such as aortic aneurysms. The Medical Sieve exemplifies IBM's philosophy that Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly, rather than to eliminate humans from the decision-making process altogether. "A radiologist in a typical emergency room situation may look at as many as 100,000 images a day," says Tanveer Syed-Mahmood, the IBM fellow who heads up the effort. "With that volume of imaging, they do have an overload in terms of high fatigue." The Medical Sieve's goal is to create an automated assistant that's as skilled at analyzing images as an entry-level radiologist, thereby freeing up time for medical professionals such as cardiologists to focus on work that requires their advanced expertise. Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood Of course, a task that would be entry-level work for a person is a remarkable accomplishment for a computer. "It has to apply clinical knowledge," says Syed-Mahmood. "It has to understand the appearance of organs in images and recognize them from different viewpoints. It has to reason with the information, know what the guidelines are, in order to cull this data, simplify it, and present it to the clinician." A range of IBM experts in AI, image processing, and medical topics are collaborating on the effort, along with external partners such as doctors; in 2015, the company also acquired Chicago-based imaging company Merge Healthcare to aid in the effort. IBM Research's Medical Sieve aims to turn computers into medical-imaging experts. Elsewhere in IBM Research-Almaden, other scientists are working on "brain-inspired computing," a project—funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense's DARPA—to create processors that think like humans. In the future, data centers utilizing vast quantities of such processors could be optimized for AI applications such as Watson's cognitive computing in ways that current computers are not. Dharmendra Modha, the IBM fellow spearheading this research, is an IBM veteran who left for a spell to form his own startup, but he was lured back by IBM Research-Almaden's ambition, approach, and resources. "I live just down the hill here," he says. "Every day, I come up and it's just such a fresh experience that I'm grateful." Watson In San Francisco The fact that IBM Research-Almaden is situated on the southern periphery of Silicon Valley means that it’s really quite far from San Francisco, which is well over an hour's drive away. But San Francisco, more than Silicon Valley, is the current epicenter of startup culture, which made it the logical place to build Watson West. (IBM already has another San Francisco office located right around the corner from Watson West: IBM Bluemix Garage, which helps developers and customers work with its cloud platform.) If IBM Research labs are traditionally built a little out of the way to encourage contemplation, Watson West more or less flips that approach on its head: It's an interface with the outside world that's right in the middle of everything, with sweeping windows that never let you forget you’re deep in the heart of San Francisco. The headquarters of kids’ clothing retailer Gymboree are across the street—so close that its employees play tic-tac-toe with IBMers using a game board affixed to a window. A peek at the Watson Experience at Watson West before its grand opening. Much of the space at Watson West is devoted to rows of cubicles for developers, designers, and researchers, looking pretty much like the environs of any tech company. But there's also the Watson Experience Center, an area that IBM will use to show outsiders what cognitive computing is capable of doing for their businesses. Like its predecessor at Watson's New York headquarters, San Francisco's Watson Experience Center has a high razzle-dazzle component; I find it reminiscent of a futuristic pavilion at Disney World's Epcot. A giant projection wall controlled by a touch screen lets visitors explore demos such as one involving a browsable guide to TED Talks that Watson created by crunching hours of raw footage and identifying topics and people. Nearby is a 360-degree multimedia theater where IBM can show off lavish, interactive mini-movies about specific Watson scenarios, including applications in medicine and commerce. I can't imagine anyone spending time there and leaving without feeling inspired by Watson's potential. IBM's decentralized approach to innovation involves 12 labs on six continents. Bay Area startups and other locals who want to learn about cognitive computing are the most obvious constituency for Watson West, but IBM expects to draw guests from near and far. "A lot of people from around the world who do tours of Silicon Valley ask for a place to go as they figure out how to put all this together," says Kenny. But that brings up an important point: Just as IBM has been in the Bay Area for more than 70 years to accomplish tasks it can't handle solely from the East Coast, it has aspirations that it knows can't be fulfilled entirely by people based on the West Coast of the United States, no matter how skilled they are. That explains why IBM's approach to innovation is so decentralized, with 12 labs on six continents. "If you think about the kinds of challenges that developing countries in Africa or developing countries like Brazil might face, having researchers there immersed in it helps us come up with what they might need there," says Welser. "Rather than me guessing, from this beautiful place I live in California, what they might need in Africa. That's really the idea of having a whole global spread." In other words, the company that's still formally known as "International Business Machines" remains deeply serious about the "International" part of its name—and Silicon Valley, important though it is, is only one pushpin on its map.

Slideshow 16 Views of ARM TechCon Softbank drives focus on Internet of Things Rick Merritt 10/28/2016 12:20 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The message from its annual conference here is ARM aims to think and be big in building and securing the emerging Internet of Things, thanks in part to backing from its new parent Softbank. Masayoshi Son, chief executive of the Japanese conglomerate, came to the event to explain why he paid a whopping 40% premium to buy the core designer. He spared no hyperbole, comparing the rise of IoT to the Cambrian explosion of thousands of species on the planet 500 million years ago. “This explosion of IoT is definitely coming, bringing the reinvention of many things — transportation, finance, health care — there will be a huge range of opportunities,” he said in a keynote. He predicted IoT revenues will exceed mobile revenues in 2018 and joked a new $100 billion vision fund he is raising, “is not enough, but it’s a good start.” “What people will see is us making bigger long term bets to accelerate our roadmap [because the Softbank deal] allows us to pursue our ambitions faster and with more scale than we could ever do before,” said ARM chief executive Simon Segars who admitted in an on-stage talk he was surprised when Softbank first made the offer. Just what big moves ARM will make or when is still not clear. “The deal closed September 5, so we couldn’t talk before that in any detail, but in the six weeks since then we’ve been talking about things like security and IoT,” said Segars in a press Q&A. Now “the discussions which are regular are about creating the biggest possible outcome,” using ARM’s resources or dipping into those of Softbank, “all bets are on,” he added. Although it has been acquiring companies at a rate of nearly one per quarter, most of ARM’s deal to date “have tended to be a bit small,” Segars noted. “Masa asks me to think in the biggest possible terms,” he added. Ironically, few in the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry lack prodding to think big. During the event, two of ARM’s top partners — Qualcomm and NXP — agreed to a $39 billion merger, the largest in the sector to date. One big idea apparently on the back burner for ARM is joining the race to define a processor for machine learning. “It’s very early days to define what the right processor architecture will be for artificial intelligence…the algorithms are changing constantly, so it’s too early for the industry to be too specific about it,” Segars said in the press Q&A. In a keynote, Segars and others talked about the importance of machine learning in the context of ARM’s acquisition of Apical. The deal gave ARM image processing and a fixed-function computer vision block. The later block is not competitive with programmable computer vision blocks provided by rivals Ceva and Cadence, said analyst Linley Gwennap of the Linley Group. The emerging nature of machine learning hasn't stopped ARM’s archrival Intel from gobbling up FPGA-maker Altera as well as two processor startups in deep learning. Intel plans to roll out its vision for the area at an event on November 17. Much of the machine learning work is done in the cloud, a highly profitable area Intel dominates. By contrast, ARM’s initiative to break into cloud computing is still nascent, and was kept in the background at the event. The effort continues to incubate, hopeful or market traction in 2017. Even smartphones got short shrift at the event despite the fact they still make up about 60% of ARM’s revenue. Instead, the focus was on IoT as the next big thing. The show floor was packed with microcontroller-based IoT demos from ARM partners. Engineers, including the founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, told stories of the growing significance of wearables and the rising maker community. Amid the hype, Segars provided some realistic perspective on IoT. While 95% of companies surveyed in 2013 expected to use IoT in three years, only 75% in a follow up this year said they have felt IoT’s impact and less than half of those companies thought the impact was significant. Cost, security and lack of management understanding of IoT were the chief barriers, according to the study ARM and IBM commissioned from The Economist and to be released later this year. ARM’s IoT message arrived just days after hackers used consumer Web cameras and set-top boxes, many run on ARM chips, to stage a bold denial of service attack. ARM executives said the chip-to-cloud security solution it rolled out at the event could prevent such attacks in the future. Increasing security will be more important in IoT than lowering costs or raising performance, said Masayoshi Son of Softbank. Cars are particularly vulnerable, he noted, given tomorrow’s autos will be connected and today’s vehicles use hundreds of chips, none of them with encryption. On one demo Segars viewed but declined to name, “security was non-existent, you could see the Wi-Fi password going by — its scare-y bad,” he said.

"It's very early days to define what the right processor architecture will be for artificial intelligence...the algorithms are changing constantly, so it's too early for the industry to be too specific about it,"   Wonder if that means that they'll focus on evolving the GPU in that direction in the short term, Nvidia style. And about big bets, isn't the IoT software as a service offering one of those? Haven't seen details on how they get payed but could be a high value product in the long run.

Why don't they employ more people? October 28, 2016   PETER PARKS/AFP/Getty Images The star-like rise of the tech industry has come with one big downside, The Wall Street Journal reports: Money is pouring in, but jobs are disappearing. The five largest U.S.-based tech companies by stock-­market value — Apple, Alphabet, Micro­soft, Face­book, and Oracle — are worth a com­bined $1.8 trillion. That's 80 percent more than the five most valuable tech companies in 2000: Cisco, Intel, IBM, Oracle, and Micro­soft. But today's tech giants employ 22 percent fewer workers than their predecessors. The big five had a combined 434,500 employees last year, compared with 556,520 at the top five firms in 2000. Some of it has to do with companies outsourcing production to foreign countries with cheaper labor, as well as the increased use of machines to replace routine, low-skill work. "As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies," The Journal reports. The Week Staff   America's biggest tech companies are worth $1.8 trillion. Why don't they employ more people? October 28, 2016 Late Night Tackles President Trump Edit Seth Meyers takes a warily amused look at Donald Trump's rocky presidential transition 1:44 a.m. ET   Donald Trump's presidential transition effort is reportedly a mess shrouded in mystery and rumors. It's like "a knife fight — and that might not be a metaphor," Seth Meyers said on Tuesday's Late Night, flipping on his Trump imitation: "Rudy, Chris, fight for my amusement." Trump has named as his chief of staff Reince Priebus, a move met with general approval in the Republican Party, but he gave an at least equally powerful role to Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, and that has caused alarm in lots of circles not enamored with white nationalism. Among those terrified by Bannon being steps away from the Oval Office is Glenn Beck. "You know the world has gone insane when Glenn Beck and Bernie Sanders are on the same page," Meyers said. "For them to be on the same page, the book has to be one page long" — and he offered a look at what that page might read: "We're all F#@!ed. The End." Trump also wants his kids to both advise him and run his business, setting up all sorts of conflict of interest. "So all we know so far about Trump's transition is that there's infighting among his advisers, and there may not be a firm division between his presidency and his business," Meyers said, oh, and Trump is already walking back some of his marquee promises. For example, "a wall that Mexico is going to pay for is now a fence that we're going to pay for." Watch. Peter Weber   Seth Meyers takes a warily amused look at Donald Trump's rocky presidential transition 1:44 a.m. Late Night Tackles President Trump Edit Conan offers an easy solution for anyone who just can't handle a Trump presidency 1:05 a.m. ET   If you are having a hard time coping with the still-stunning news that Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, drugs are not the best answer — with the possible exception of this fictional one on Conan. "You have to accept the fact that Trump will be our next president," the narrator says in a faux commercial posted online Tuesday. "Or, you can live in blissful denial like I do, by taking 'She Won' A-Day vitamins." These "vitamins" use "powerful truth inhibitors" to convince the taker that Hillary won the presidency, and they're not just for women — or Mexicans, or Muslims, or black people; they also apparently work if you're married to a sanctimonious Bernie Bro. Watch below. Peter Weber   Conan offers an easy solution for anyone who just can't handle a Trump presidency 1:05 a.m. this is horrible Edit U.N. says 75,000 Nigerian children at risk of starving to death within months 12:39 a.m. ET   Stefan Heunis/AFP/Getty Images Since 2009, the Boko Haram insurgency has displaced millions of people and disrupted farming and trade in northeastern Nigeria, and now an estimated 14 million people in the country need humanitarian aid. The United Nations humanitarian coordinator, Peter Lundberg, said Tuesday that 400,000 children are in critical need of food, and 75,000 could starve to death "in the few months ahead of us." In September, at least 10 people a day were dying of starvation in a camp for displaced people near Maiduguri. The U.N. does not have enough money to fully combat the crisis, and said Nigerian philanthropists, international partners, and the private sector must help in any way they can. Boko Haram is still active in northeastern Nigeria, routinely conducting suicide attacks. Catherine Garcia   U.N. says 75,000 Nigerian children at risk of starving to death within months 12:39 a.m. Trump Transition Edit Donald Trump ditches press pool for steak dinner at Manhattan restaurant 12:16 a.m. ET   At 6:14 p.m. on Tuesday, Donald Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the reporters and photographers covering Trump at his Manhattan residence that the president-elect was staying in his apartment for the rest of the night — calling a "lid." Less than two hours later, an unscheduled motorcade left Trump Tower, and the press pool did not know where Trump was until a Bloomberg municipal-bond journalist tweeted out a photo of him entering the upscale 21 Club restaurant (which she misidentified as Keene's). Standing ovation and cheers at Keene's steakhouse for @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/zJsA1t00Sk — Taylor Riggs (@RiggsReport) November 16, 2016 Hicks later said she had not meant to lie to the press and had not known Trump was slipping out to dine with his family, then asked the press pool to respect the president-elect's privacy. That is traditionally not how the presidency works — at least one member of the protective press pool always follows the president around to inform the public where he is and document if anything happens to or near the U.S. commander-in-chief. Ditching the press is a big violation or protocol, and not the first from Trump, who declined to travel with the press while he was campaigning and hasn't held a press conference since the summer. "With his Tuesday night actions, the Trump Administration is shaping up to be the least accessible to the public and the press in modern history," say Alexandra Jaffe and Ali Vitali at NBC News. At first glance, this sounds like "a Beltway media thing, or an inside baseball thing," but it really isn't, Rachel Maddow said on MSNBC. "Once you are president, once you are president-elect, it is a matter of tradition, it is a matter of security, it is a matter of national interest that you don't go dark — you're not really allowed to be a private person anymore," she explained. "There's no law that says the president or president-elect has to allow a press pool representative to follow their movements, but it is tradition, and it's tradition for a reason, and it's a tradition that has a national security basis, and it's a tradition, so far at least, that Donald Trump appears intent on not following." Peter Weber   Donald Trump ditches press pool for steak dinner at Manhattan restaurant 12:16 a.m. how rude Edit Bill O'Reilly implies Megyn Kelly is making Fox News look bad November 15, 2016   Rob Kim/Getty Images While promoting his new manners book for children, Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly also gave a lesson in irony when he made snide comments about his colleague, Megyn Kelly. In her new memoir, Settle for More, Kelly alleges that the former boss at Fox News, Roger Ailes, made unwanted sexual advances (he has denied the allegations). On Tuesday morning, while plugging Give Please a Chance, O'Reilly told CBS's Norah O'Donnell that he was "not interested in making my network look bad. At all. That doesn't interest me one bit." O'Donnell asked if that's what Kelly is doing with her book, and O'Reilly responded: "I don't know. But I'm not going to bother with it." O'Reilly — who did pay Kelly a compliment by saying she is a "smart woman" — said he has not read Settle for More, and that "it's a very tough book environment. We'll see if people respond to it." Hours later on The O'Reilly Factor, seemingly still irritated, O'Reilly tackled the theme of loyalty. Without naming Kelly, O'Reilly said, "If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. If you don't like what's happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave! I've done that. And then take the action you need to take afterward, if you feel aggrieved. There are labor laws in this country. But don't try to run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it. Factor tip of the day: Loyalty is good." The Kelly File was on immediately afterwards, and Kelly said at the end of the show she wrote about Ailes because she "thought it was an important story to include, and I'm proud to say that our bosses here at Fox [agree]. Like me, they believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant." Catherine Garcia   Bill O'Reilly implies Megyn Kelly is making Fox News look bad November 15, 2016 that's reassuring Edit Donald Trump says only he knows who his cabinet finalists are November 15, 2016   Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump continues to use Twitter like no one else before him, and on Tuesday, he turned to his trusted mode of communication to reassure followers that all is well as he makes the transition to the White House. "Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions," he tweeted. "I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!" Trump's transition team has been going through very public turmoil, with Mike Rogers, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman serving as a national security adviser, departing Tuesday. A former State Department official under former President George W. Bush, Eliot A. Cohen, tweeted Tuesday he had an exchange with Trump's transition team and recommended people "stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming 'you LOST!' Will be ugly." On Friday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) was demoted from head of the team to a vice-chair, and was replaced by vice president-elect Mike Pence. Several people close to the team told NBC News Christie was not seen as being sufficiently loyal to Trump, and Rogers and others close to the governor were victims of a "Stalinesque purge." Trump also listens closely to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father Charles Kushner was prosecuted by Christie in 2004 on charges of tax fraud and witness tampering; he was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Catherine Garcia   Donald Trump says only he knows who his cabinet finalists are November 15, 2016 from enemies to frenemies? Edit Ted Cruz is keeping mum about NYC meeting with Donald Trump November 15, 2016   Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 2016 has not been an easy year for Ted Cruz — he lost the Republican primary, he accidentally elbowed his wife in the face multiple times on live television, his father was falsely linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, his old Princeton roommate spent weeks tweeting about how creepy he was in college. Cruz took another hit last week, when he settled a lawsuit for $55,000 that alleged his campaign played two copyrighted songs in political ads. The Seattle music-licensing firm Audiosocket claimed that Cruz and an ad agency he hired, Madison McQueen, did not reveal that they planned to use the music of two artists for political advertisements. One of the ads ran on Fox Business News 86 times and was viewed on YouTube 7,800 times, the lawsuit stated. In addition to paying Audiosocket $55,000, Cruz's campaign released a statement saying it apologized for "unintentionally infringing upon the intellectual property rights" of the artists. Cruz's sad year just might be turning around, though — on Tuesday, he visited Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, amid rumblings that he could be taking on a role in Trump's administration. As he left the building, Cruz wouldn't answer reporters who asked if he is vying for a spot, but Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The Washington Post's Robert Costa it's a possibility that Cruz, "young and in the mold of [Antonin] Scalia," could be nominated for the Supreme Court. Of course, this could just be the wishful thinking of a man who currently has to work with Ted Cruz every day.

Windows Server 2016 has code to supercharge data storage IO speed by not treating it as IO anymore. It uses storage-class memory (SCM) as a persistent store, one that is on the memory bus, close to the CPU, and doesn't lose its contents when power is lost, an NVDIMM-N type device. That can be provided by having a Flash DIMM on a host system's memory channel, or a DRAM DIMM with on-DIMM flash backup against power failure. Future storage class memory media possibilities include Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint memory. JEDEC has defined three classes of NVDIMM: NVDIMM-N is a DRAM/Flash hybrid memory module using flash to save the DRAM contents upon power failure NVDIMM-F is for all-flash DIMMs like those made by Diablo/WD (SanDisk) NVDIMM-P is a flash DIMM treated as persistent memory (block-addressable) JEDEC-compliant N-class Non-volatile DIMMs (NVDIMM-N) storage-class memory devices are supported in Windows with native drivers, starting in Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 (version 1607). You can use NVDIMM-N devices as byte-addressable and block-addressable storage in Windows Server 2016. For example SQL Server log files could be stored on NVDIMM-Ns with database records out on disk. Here is a Microsoft video talking about its use as block storage: Using NVDIMM-N as block storage in Windows Server 2016 NVDIMM-N deployment NVDIMM-N is based on DDR4 DRAM plus flash for backup and it exposes a block interface, exactly like disk and SSD devices today, with read and write file semantics above an SCM driver, and load-store semantics below it, where it talks to the media. In a test Microsoft found an NVMe SSD could do 55MBps at 68 microsecs latency. The same simple, single-threaded task, was done at 700MBps and 5 microsecs latency on a DDR4 NVDIMM-N accessed in block mode. NVDIMM_N block mode is enabled in Windows Server 2016 by a Microsoft-defined _DSM specification, exposing it as a new kind of disk device, and is usable in Storage Spaces – Microsoft's storage virtualisation technology – for striping, mirroring and write-back caching. You can query information about NVDIMM-N devices through PowerShell cmdlets. Storage-class memory can be driven faster still, using byte addressing. A second Microsoft video talks about using NVDIMM-Ns in byte-addressable mode or DAX mode, with DAX referring to Direct Access volumes. Files are memory-mapped on to these volumes and access to data sidesteps the use of the block-mode software stack, saving time by further reducing latency, providing apps with direct access to the NVDIMM-N hardware (DAX volume). There is a pre-existing memory-mapped files infrastructure in Windows which is used for this. DAX volumes in an SCMe-aware file system (NTFS - DAX) are identified by a new flag and updates are directly written to the NVDIMM-N with no OS storage stack involvement. NTFS - DAX talks to the SCM driver which then talks directly to the NVDIMM-N media as before. In effect a DAX app, a DirectAccess application, has direct access, using load and store semantics, to a memory-mapped region in the NVDIMM-N media. Windows server 2016 DAX architecture Filter drivers relying on detecting and reacting to IO will see no IO and won't work. That means encryption filters. Anti-virus will still work as such code only needs to know when a file was modified – look for a close on the file – and run a scan when that's detected. DAX volumes are created using one of two commands: -> Format n: /dax /q -> Format-Volume -Driveletter n -IsDAX $true Once created they have a flag value which can be checked by an app looking at the volume handle or a file handle. Obviously then existing app code has to change to accomplish this and use the memory mapping-based read and write (load and store or faster Windows non-temporal instructions) data accesses. The benefit is that apps get DDR4 memory speed access to persistent storage. There are fewer context switches with highly contested data structures and thousands of CPU cycles are freed up to do more useful work. In a simple 4K random write test using a single thread against an NVMe SSD the latency was 0.07ms (70 microsecs) and bandwidth about 56MBps. Running the same test in a block mode NVDIMM-N we see 0.01ms (10 microsecs) latency and 580MBps, ten times faster. Now, running the same test in byte-addressable mode the result is eight times faster still, more than 8GBps at c820ns latency. Microsoft is working on porting an NVML (Non-Volatile Memory Library) to Windows to help developers adapt apps for DAX volumes. It’s a toolset project maintained on GitHub see http://pmem.io/ and currently works on Linux. Note that NVDIMM-N drives made completely with flash will be slower than DRAM DIMMs wth flash backup. NVDIMM-N drives made wth XPoint will be faster than flash DIMMs but still slower than DRAM DIMMs; DRAM is faster than XPoint. Of course, if you have a ton of XPoint NVDIMM-Ns replacing significant disk drive or SSD storage and not so much DRAM then your system will totally fly, but not as fast as a full DRAM or DRAM NVDIMM-N system. This Microsoft video has information at the end to find out more and it’s worth checking out if you have apps that could benefit from a dose of NVDIMM-N supercharging. The best IO is – wait for it – no IO. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 12 Comments More from The Register Plexistor unveils storage-stack-perplexing PMoF tech More not-quite-remote memory speeds apps Windows Server 2016: Leg up or lock in?

Chris Hall28 October 2016Laptops Microsoft/Apple/Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The gauntlet has been thrown down. Microsoft has updated its top-spec Surface Book, while Apple has updated its MacBook Pro, putting in a new Touch Bar feature. These two laptops square up, both pushing innovative features, trying to pull you to Windows and macOS respectively and claim the cash in your pocket.  But how do they compare head-to-head? This is the Surface Book vs MacBook Pro breakdown, comparing those 13-inch models. Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Design Surface Book has a detachable display MacBook Pro offers OLED Touch Bar Microsoft introduced the Surface Book design in 2015 and although the model updated in 2016, it still looks the same, offering that proper keyboard, that innovative hinge that will let the screen sit at any angle, as well as offering a detachable 13.5-inch display. The Surface Book measures 312.3 x 232.1 x 22.8mm and weighs 1.516kg or 1.647kg for the top i7 Performance Base model. The MacBook Pro has an all-new design that slims down the aluminium unibody, expands the Force Touch trackpad and gives a really slim display, which remains attached.  MacBook Pro measures 304.1 x 212.4 x 14.9mm, so it's smaller in all directions than the Surface Book. It weighs 1.37kg, so it's a good deal lighter too. The MacBook Pro introduces a Touch Bar OLED panel, replacing the function keys at the top of the keyboard, dynamically changing depending on what you're doing. There's also a Touch ID sensor in the power button, allowing for Apple Pay payments online, and easy sign-in.  Touch Bar gives you dedicated controls that simply don't exist on other devices, with a solution that's adaptable and doesn't require any touching on the display itself.  These laptops are different: MacBook Pro might be more compact and portable, but Surface Book offers a full touch tablet, so it's potentially more flexible, if a little bulkier. Microsoft Surface Book i7 (2016): Not an overhaul, but certainly more oomph Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Display Surface Book: 13.5-inch, 3000 x 2000 pixels, 267ppi, touchscreen MacBook Pro: 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1600 pixels, 227ppi There's a big difference in what you can use these displays for. Surface Book has an advantage, offering a detachable display that offers full touch, as well as supporting Surface Pen. That means that Surface Book will do things you'd need an iPad Pro for - here there's a Windows tablet in the same package. The Surface Book has a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a 3000 x 2000 pixel resolution, 267ppi, with 3:2 aspect.  The MacBook Pro offers a conventional 13.3-inch Retina display with 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, 227ppi, with 8:5 aspect. The Surface Book is sharper and can potentially offer more detail on its display, although the MacBook Pro has always been a very good quality display and in this latest model, it boosts the brightness and contrast.  Which looks better is difficult to judge without getting them side-by-side.  Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Hardware Both offer Intel Core i5 and i7 options Surface Book offers discrete Nvidia GPUs Both the Surface Book and the MacBook Pro offer sixth-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs. Both offer various RAM from 8GB to 16GB depending on your configuration. The Surface Book starts with 128GB SSD, with options up to 1TB. The MacBook Pro starts at 256GB SSD, with options up to 1TB. Storage depends on the model configuration you choose in both cases. When it comes to GPU, the MacBook Pro 13-inch offers Intel Iris Graphics 540 or 550, depending on the model you choose. There's only the option for an AMD Radeon GPU on 15-inch MacBook Pro models, so the 13-inch model is a little weaker in the GPU department.  The Surface Book offers much wider options for graphics, with Intel HD graphics at the entry level, but also offering discrete GPUs, up to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M on the top i7 model.  At the entry level these two laptops might be close, but in the 13-inch size, Microsoft is offering more powerful graphical options than Apple does. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Connections and ports Surface Book: Two USB 3.0, SD card, Mini DisplayPort MacBook Pro: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports If you've been paying attention, you'll know that the MacBook Pro has axed a lot of ports, moving to Thunderbolt 3 for everything - charging and all connections you want to make. In the short term, than probably means that not much will connect to it without an adapter.  That makes the Surface Book instantly more compatible with existing devices. Surface Book supports your old USB devices, you can put your memory card in it and connect to your existing monitor for example. It's not as simple as saying the Surface Book is better as a result, however. MacBook Pro still has connections and they are all versatile, supporting HDMI, DisplayPort, USB and so on, but all though the USB Type-C design. In some ways, that makes for better connectivity, it's just that you probably don't have any of those connectors or adapters yet. For those interested in photography, the loss of an SD card slot is probably the biggest bugbear with the MacBook Pro. For things like other connections, changing cables won't be a long-term hardship. Here's how much the new MacBook Pro will cost you in new adapters and cables Microsoft Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Price Surface Book: $1,699 (256GB) MacBook Pro: $1,799 (256GB)  The starting price of these laptops doesn't tell the whole story. The older Surface Book at $1,349 comes with half the storage of the MacBook Pro's starting point, so we've picked the 256GB model instead, where the pricing is close, with the Surface Book a little cheaper.  However, because of those powerful GPU options, the top Surface Book, with Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD and an Nvidia GPU will cost you $3,299. The top MacBook Pro, with Core i7, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD will cost you $2,899.  Although these devices occupy different spaces - Apple is more conventional but offers that unique Touch Bar, Microsoft is more versatile with touch and tablet mode - they're both gunning to be the best 13-inch laptops around.  Whichever you choose, be prepared to be a pretty penny for them.  The Surface Book is available to order from the Microsoft Store. The MacBook Pro is available to pre-order from the Apple Store.

Published by Rean,in Gadgets Microsoft recently unveiled Surface Studio, its new desktop computer that not only pleases its current fan base, but also those who have for so long been under Apple’s spell. The reveal itself gave chills to millions of technophiles and creatives, and instantly everyone thought of the same thing: “I want one.” Here’s another thing: It kind of looks like an iMac, no? And indeed it does, from its sleek surface (pun intended), black borders, and the way it is propped up – one glance and you’ll instantly think of an iMac. But how does it compare to an iMac? There are already predictions flying around that Surface Studio will deal a great blow to Apple’s iMac. Let’s find out how true this is. It’s not a fair comparison at a glance The Surface Studio is perhaps the most innovative and bravest product Microsoft has produced in the recent years, and it is their take on Apple’s iMac which has so long dominated the creative industry all over the world. Graphic artists, web designers, animators, video editors, most of these people prefer an iMac over other pre-packaged desktops in the market simply because of its raw power and crisp display – something creatives would kill for. But make no mistake (I’m an iMac user myself and I can honestly say that it’s not a fair comparison) and at first glance the Surface Studio wins by a grand slam. Is Surface Studio a desktop computer or a graphics tablet? If you watched the device trailer, you will notice that the Surface Studio can also double as a graphics tablet, which digital illustrators and animators use to draw directly onto in order to transfer their drawings into their computer. A popular brand for a graphics tablet is the Wacom. And if you don’t know, they’re pretty pricey. Pin it This is a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD Right now you can buy a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD for $2,300 and no, it’s not even a computer. Surface Studio’s base model is both and it’s only around $700 more, at $2,999. But we’re here to compare the Surface Studio with an iMac, and so I shall. In terms of display The Surface Studio is a massive 28″ display at 4500×3000 resolution. Its display type uses PixelSense, which promises higher than 4K resolution. While that looks great, the iMac’s top-of-the-line model sits at 27″ Retina 5K display with 5120×2880 resolution, that’s 14.7 million pixels, which is 1.2 million more than Surface Studio. Is it a close fight between the two in terms of resolution and crispness of display? Probably not. The Surface Studio is at 192 pixels per inch (13.5 million pixels total) while the iMac is at 217 pixels per inch (14.7 million pixels total), so the iMac clearly wins this round. Pin it Microsoft Surface Studio and Apple iMac Display Comparison In terms of aspect ratio, Surface Studio is at 3:2 and iMac 27″ is at 16:9, which is a big difference. The new Surface is more squarish than the iMac, which would probably miff a lot of people, especially those who are used to having a wider screen. Looking at those numbers, iMac definitely wins. But honestly can the naked eye actually tell the differences? I’m going to leave you with that but not before I mention that the entire Surface Studio’s display is touchscreen? That’s one selling point. Although if you are a photographer or a video editor, smudges on the screen is probably something you’d hate to see (it’s like touching the lens of your camera). How powerful are they? Things might still change for the Surface Studio since it is still on pre-order phase, but right now it offers Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, using Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M-980M at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. The Apple iMac, on the other hand, also uses Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, using AMD Radeon R9 M380, M390, and M395X at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. It is important to note that this latest iMac model has been around since 2015! There doesn’t seem much of a difference in terms of their Intel processors, but there is a big difference when it comes to their graphic processing chips. Microsoft decided to go Nvidia GeForce all the way while Apple went for AMD. Where Surface Studio straight up murders the iMac First Stab – All-in-One Desktop and Graphics Tablet Pin it Surface Studio desktop and studio form The Surface Studio is after the professional creative class of Mac users who deal with graphics, photos, and videos daily. The biggest innovation that Microsoft has introduced to their line of hardware is Surface Studio’s display which enables its users to draw directly on it – acting like a touchscreen tablet and a computer all in one. It’s going to be a big blow for Apple, especially if people are more willing to spend at least a thousand dollars more. Second Stab – Sexy Base Support Pin it Another important thing to note, which probably should get more attention, is its Zero Gravity Hinge (the base support), which provides seamless transition between desktop mode to studio mode (tablet mode). Users can change the angle of the display with just one hand, from an upright position to a more comfortable position for drawing. Third Stab – Surface Dial (Major Damage) Pin it One more thing: Surface Dial. It’s a new peripheral that Microsoft has introduced that definitely made a scene. It can be placed on the screen itself to allow users to choose colors just by turning the dial. Meanwhile, Apple recently announced a new Macbook Pro with a Touch Bar. Check out this link for more on it. Pin it The TL;DR version If all you care about are the numbers and the specs, this is what you are looking for.

Price Graphics Display Processor Memory Storage $2,999 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GDDR5 memory 28″ PixelSense Display, 4500×3000 resolution, 10 point multi-touch, 3:2 aspect ratio 6th Generation Intel Core i5 8GB 1TB Rapid Hybrid Drive $3,499 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GDDR5 memory 6th Generation Intel Core i7 16GB 1TB Rapid Hybrid Drive $4,199 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M 4GB GDDR5 memory 6th Generation Intel Core i7 32GB 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive Apple 27″ iMac Price Graphics Display Processor Memory Storage $1,799 AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics processor with 2GB of GDDR5 memory 27″ Retina 5K display with IPS technology, 5120×2880 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio Intel Core i5 8GB 1TB Drive $1,999 AMD Radeon R9 M390 graphics processor with 2GB of GDDR5 memory Intel Core i7 16GB 1TB Fusion Drive $2,299 AMD Radeon R9 M395 graphics processor with 2GB of GDDR5 memory. Intel Core i7 32GB 2TB Fusion Drive What’s the verdict? Surface Studio or iMac? If you are buying a computer based on its numbers, then without a doubt the iMac wins. But don’t forget that the Surface Studio is something entirely different – it’s a hybrid, and with that the price is justified. If you are among the creative class who is looking for an “entry-level” desktop computer for work-related matters, the iMac line of 2015 still takes the cake when it comes to price-to-hardware ratio. This is particularly true if you are under budget. While the base model of the latest iMac series is significantly less powerful than Surface Studio, it still works as one of the finest desktop computers ever built. But if you are looking to expand your creative arsenal and explore the possibilities of your imagination, and perhaps more importantly if you have the budget, and would like to work by hand, perhaps the Surface Studio is worth a shot.

Unveiled this week is the Cupertino firm’s vision of how touch and notebooks can co-exist, and it’s a very different interpretation compared to the 2-in-1’s and convertibles we’ve seen in Windows land. Not all the new MacBook Pro models are created equal, however, and it’s the new, $1,499 entry-level model which has landed first on the SlashGear test bench. Unfortunately, that means I can’t tell you about the experience of living – albeit even just briefly – with the Touch Bar, because that’s one of the missing features on the entry-level MacBook Pro. Instead, you get a regular strip of function keys, sharing real-estate with the familiar shortcuts for volume, brightness, and media control. It’s not the only difference between it and its more expensive siblings, either. The extra $300 you spend on the Touch Bar-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro doesn’t just get you the slender touchscreen strip. It also doubles the number of Thunderbolt 3 ports you have, not to mention upgrading the processor from a 2.0 GHz dual-core Core i5 to a 2.9 GHz version. The Intel graphics take a small step up, too, from Iris 540 to Iris 550, and not only does the more expensive notebook have Touch ID, but a third microphone rather than the two on the entry-level model. In fact, assuming you’re enamored of the Touch Bar, there’s only one slightly unexpected benefit of going for the cheapest MacBook Pro, and that’s the battery. Even though Apple rates both notebooks the same for typical runtime – up to 10 hours of wireless web browsing or iTunes movie playback, or up to 30 days of standby time – the $1,499 version actually has a slightly larger li-poly pack inside. Admittedly, it’s a fairly small difference: 54.5 watt-hours versus 49.2 watt-hours. Given what little time I’ve had to actually use the new MacBook Pro, I can’t tell you how long the battery holds up in regular use yet. That’ll have to wait for the eventual review. What I have done, though, is charge it up with the included power adapter and USB-C cable. I suspect the pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports on this particular MacBook Pro may prove more of a hindrance than just forcing users to add a dongle or three to their laptop bag. On the more expensive versions, the absence of MagSafe 2 feels justified by the quartet of Thunderbolt 3, any of which can be used to charge the notebook up. After all, you still have three remaining ports to play with. On the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, however, plug in the power supply and all of a sudden you’re down to a single spare port for everything else. Now, Thunderbolt 3 is a mighty capable connection, at least in theory: after all, each supports charging, DisplayPort, up to 40 Gbps of Thunderbolt data, and up to 10 Gbps of USB 3.1 data. However the number of actual peripherals that can take advantage of that are fairly limited. What’s more likely is that you’ll be doing a fair among of plugging and unplugging of single-purpose dongles, and having lived with a 12-inch MacBook for the past couple of years, I know how frustrating that can be at times. Even with a fairly compact USB-C hub – I like Huawei’s – it’s a chore to have all that dangling off the side of your notebook, particularly if you’re trying to use it on your lap. If you’re viewing the $1,499 13-inch MacBook Pro as a 13-inch MacBook Air alternative, that limitation becomes even more noticeable. Yes, the older Air might be a little bigger than its new cousin, but it uses that space to fit in a MagSafe 2, two USB 3, a Thunderbolt 2, and an SDXC card reader. None of them are as individually flexible as a Thunderbolt 3, true, but I suspect they’ll be more immediately-usable. In the process you miss out on the performance improvements. The sixth-gen Core i5 is not to be sniffed at – in this case the i5-6360U – with a solid 8GB of memory (albeit slower 1,866 MHz LPDDR3 than the $1,799 model’s 2,133 MHz) and 256GB of storage. Honestly, benchmarks only give a fraction of the story, but in Geekbench 3 it came in at 3,128 for the single-core test and 7,099 in the multi-core test. Those doing heavy-duty video editing – or wanting to play games, for that matter – will, as before, likely want to look to the 15-inch MacBook Pro instead. That gets AMD discrete graphics as standard after all. Apple isn’t referring to the “Butterfly” keyboard on the new MacBook Pro as its second-generation, at least not officially, though it probably could. It’s based on the same premise as the ‘board in the 12-inch MacBook, a single flexing assembly which makes for less keycap wobble, but modified with greater travel and a different dome mechanism underneath. As on the 12-inch, the keys themselves are larger with less space in-between. I’m a fan of the original “Butterfly” keyboard, personally, though I know many others aren’t. Happily, the new MacBook Pro strikes a balance somewhere in-between old keyboard and new. You get the increased stability of each individual key, but there’s a more definite depression when your finger strikes. Even if you disliked the MacBook’s keyboard, it’s worth keeping an open-mind for this new iteration. Underneath there’s a significantly larger trackpad than before, and it’s another carry-over from the MacBook. Courtesy of Force Touch you have the sensation of movement without a physically hinged ‘pad, along with the ability to press “deeper” into the click to summon context-relevant extras such as dictionary definitions or address look-ups. Even though I have relatively narrow wrists, I was a little concerned that the wider area on the new MacBook Pro could lead to issues with accidental taps, but Apple’s updated palm-rejection appears to be doing the trick. There’s no denying that this is a less exciting MacBook Pro than the more expensive models. Indeed, with no Touch Bar and half the ports, there’s far more of a sense that Apple built this particular notebook to a budget. Yes, the company can bill its new line-up as starting from $1,499, but it’s really from the $1,799 point upward when it begins to sparkle. Personally, the reason I’d buy this over the 13-inch MacBook Air is the display. Once you’ve spent some time in front of a wide color gamut panel, it’s hard to go back to a screen which doesn’t have P3 support. Until now, that’s meant an iMac Retina 5K, a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, or, most recently, the iPhone 7: if you’ve wanted P3 and a portable Mac, you’ve been out of luck. NOW READ: MacBook Pro Touch Bar hands-on That all changes with the new MacBook Pro, and it’s another astonishing display. Colors are richer and deeper – reds and greens particularly, without the unnatural hue and bleed of over-saturation – while contrast is much improved too. Side-by-side with the old 13-inch MacBook Pro, and the difference is night and day. I’m even okay with giving up the illuminated Apple logo on the lid for it (you get a shiny badge instead). Still to come: battery life, how that double port situation holds up, everyday performance, and if Apple really has done audio magic with its “completely redesigned speakers. In short, I’ll have more on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro – not to mention its siblings – in the coming weeks, though if you’re already convinced it’s shipping from today.

(AMD) Stock Run with the AMD stock bulls with this option play Oct 28, 2016, 10:29 am EST  |  By Tyler Craig, Tales of a Technician     Following a slight detour, the bull market for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is back, baby! And with earnings now in the rearview mirror, spectators can get back to the business of trading AMD stock without fear of any fundamental gremlins sabotaging their positions. Click to Enlarge Source: OptionsAnalytix Unlike fellow semiconductor stock, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which took a dirtnap following earnings and has yet to recover, AMD has bounced back vigorously following its minor drop. The Sunnyvale-based company bested expectations by earning 3 cents per share last quarter. This has been a banner year for AMD on the stock front. As of Thursday’s close ($7.11), AMD shares were up 148% year-to-date. Momentum lovers have flocked to the stock all year-long, basking in its upside volatility and high-quality breakout patterns. What caught my eye this week was the Monday-Tuesday moonshot, which carried shares above a key resistance level at $7. The breakout was accompanied by higher-than-average volume bringing validity to the breach. 3 Down-And-Out Cloud Stocks to Trade And with the price pop, AMD stock is now perched nicely above all its major moving averages. Consider the damage inflicted during the September swoon officially corrected. This week’s strength is making yesterday’s pullback appear an attractive dip-buying opportunity. Provided prices don’t retreat below $6.75, I think sidelined bulls should be pouncing here. The AMD Trade The cheaper price tag of AMD makes it an easy candidate for a stock trade. If you’re looking for a straightforward way to profit from continued strength, grab shares here with a stop below the recent pivot low of $6.37. A break of that support level would invalidate the lion’s share of today’s analysis. For a price target, look for Advanced Micro Devices to return to $8 and beyond. Traders preferring the higher probability route could sell the Dec $7 puts. They currently sit slightly out-of-the-money and offer 50 cents of premium. The reward is limited to the 50 cents and will be captured if AMD sits above $7 at expiration. By selling the put you obligate yourself to buy 100 shares at an effective purchase price of $6.50. To minimize the loss, I suggest bailing on this if AMD stock breaches the aforementioned support level. At the time of this writing Tyler Craig had no positions in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (XLE): This Dip Is a Buy!

Intel Leads Tech and Telecom Green Power Rankings Related Topics All EL Stories Clean Energy Climate Environmental Policy & Law Feature Solar Energy Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Utilities Wind Energy The corporate community is leading the green energy economy. Today, nearly 1,300 organizations are partnering with the US Environmental Protection Agency to either generate or buy green energy. The result, according to EPA: lowering carbon emissions and greater brand equity, making the proposition a win-win scenario. “By using green, an organization not only can dramatically reduce its carbon footprint but it may be able to save money, stand out from competitors, and meet corporate environmental goals, which is of growing importance to stakeholder groups such as customers, Wall Street analysts, shareholders and employees,” says EPA. Some of the leaders: Intel, Kohl’s Department Stores, Whole Foods Market, the city of Houston and Dell. Take Kohl’s: It is one the world’s largest retail solar hosts, says EPA, with solar panels that are placed in stores in not just on the West Coast in California but also on the East Coast in New Jersey and Connecticut. Wisconsin is another key location. Much of that is through power purchase arrangements, where a third party generates the electricity that is bought over a period of years by Kohl’s. That gives the developer a guaranteed income stream while it allows the retailer to keep its prices in check. Wal-Mart is another big box retailer that is active in the green market. It is purchasing wind power from a Duke Energy wind farm in Texas, which supplies the retailer with 15% of its electricity needs in that state alone. Nationally, Wal-Mart says that it gets 25% of its energy from renewables and that it has a goal of 100%. And according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wal-Mart and Target are the two biggest installers of solar power in the nation. They have installed 145 megawatts and 147 megawatts, respectively, it adds. “Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio,” said Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart. “This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam’s Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business. Being recognized by the SEIA for our efforts is confirmation that we are moving in the right direction with regards to renewable energy, specifically solar.” “At Target, sustainability is a principle that drives the decisions we make across the company – from the products we make to the way we run our business,” adds John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target. “We’re incredibly proud of the progress we’ve made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress.”  More than 860 utilities offer green power programs to their customers, says the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That is giving more than half of the electricity customers nationwide the option to buy renewable energy from a provider. Eco-minded businesses are snatching up the credits. Software manufacturer SAP says that it has a goal of getting to 100% green fuels while Microsoft says that it now gets 80% of its electricity from renewables. As the technologies are getting incorporated by the nation’s bigger companies, they are subsequently becoming more and more accessible to all businesses. And with that trend, the New Energy Economy has taken root and will only sprout higher.

Over the course of the last few months, numerous speculations about the device’s features emerged, many of which were proven right on Thursday’s big event. The MacBook Pro has not been revamped in quite a long time. The last refresh of the machine took place May of last year, but even then, the upgrades that were given to the device were mostly incremental. The 2016 MacBook Pro is the first real upgrade to the esteemed powerhouse line, and it embodies much of what Apple is right now. Specs-wise, the MacBook Pro somewhat lags behind its competitors. This is evident just by looking at the heart of the device. The MacBook Pro 2016 still carries Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake chips, which is one step away from the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are found on flagship laptops from rivals like Dell and HP. Despite the MacBook Pro 2016 only being equipped with a Skylake processor, however, it is still a pretty formidable device, partly due to Apple’s mastery of using all the technology that its devices have to their utmost potential. Coupled with MacOS Sierra, the 2016 MacBook Pro runs programs extremely smoothly. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] One thing that definitely characterizes the MacBook Pro 2016 is the machine’s use of Apple’s first ever Touch Bar, an innovative touchscreen that takes the place of the laptop’s traditional function keys. The Touch Bar is extremely flexible, allowing users of the MacBook Pro 2016 to access commands for specific programs directly from the strip. For example, if players are playing music, the bar would display music controls. If the user is using Photoshop, on the other hand, the Touch Bar would instead feature several notable tools and commands that are pertinent to the program. TouchID purchases and answering FaceTime calls are also accomplished through the Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro 2016 comes in three iterations, two 13-inch units and one 15-inch machine. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, though the machine is equipped with a standard keyboard and slightly lower specs. The 13-inch model that is equipped with the Touch Bar is priced at $1,799, while the 15-inch MacBook Pro is priced at a very premium $2,399. During the end of the event, Apple presented its laptop line once more, presenting the three MacBook Pro 2016 variants alongside the 2016 MacBook, which was unveiled earlier this year. With the four devices comprising Apple’s laptop lineup for the year, one particular rumor was proven right. The MacBook Air is officially dead. [Image by David Paul Morris/Getty Images] The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop for years, and it proved extremely popular for casual users and students. For those who were looking for a reasonably-priced Mac with formidable specs to boot, the MacBook Air was a very easy sell. However, the introduction of last year’s ultraportable MacBook seemed like a sign that Apple was ready to retire the Air line. As it turned out, such speculations were right, as Apple did ultimately end the MacBook Air line with the introduction of the MacBook Pro 2016. While the Air’s removal does make sense from a business standpoint, the departure of the MacBook Air from Apple’s lineup will surely be felt by the brand’s avid followers. This is because the MacBook Air is a laptop that provides a great balance between power, price, and portability. MacBook Pros are very powerful, but prior to the introduction of the 2016 model, the line is represented by relatively huge machines that are pretty difficult to carry around. The MacBook, on the other hand, was extremely portable and well-made. It was, however, notoriously underpowered for its price. Thus, MacBook Airs have been, for the past few years at least, the Apple device that is just right. The three variants of the MacBook Pro 2016 are arguably the best portable machines that Apple has ever made. They are, however, entering the market just as a fan favorite is being retired. Apple’s earnings for the next few quarters would ultimately prove if the MacBook Pro 2016’s balance of price, specs, and features would be enough to fill the void left behind by the MacBook Air. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVPRkcczXCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Paralyzed Monkey Walks Again After Implant Now Read This: 2016 MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Gets Mixed Reviews: Is The New Microsoft Surface Book Better?

This week, however, the companies that defined the personal computer, Microsoft and Apple, gave us a glimpse of the future and it looks like a return to the past: the PC is going back to being an exclusive and expensive machine. Set aside all the explosions of color on gorgeous, high-resolution displays. Ignore the glamorous promo videos and the ultrathin, all-metal chassis of the new Surface Studio and MacBook Pro. Instead, focus on the prices. From Microsoft, we have the $2,999 Surface Studio, which scales up to $4,199 when you juice up the RAM to 32GB and the storage to 2TB. Also out of Redmond is an updated Surface Book with up to 16 hours of battery life and a $2,399 starting price. That portable computer maxes out at $3,299 with added storage and memory. Buying the top Surface Studio and MacBook Pro models together would cost you $8,498 Apple’s new MacBook Pro family is universally more expensive than the one it’s replacing: the supposedly entry-level MBP, lacking a Touch Bar, starts at $1,499. To get a Touch Bar, the least you’d need to spend is $1,799, and if you want to go beyond 13 inches, the 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399. Upgrade the processor and graphics, opt for 2TB of storage, and you’ll reach the incredible heights of $4,299. Here’s my interpretation of this phenomenon: Apple and Microsoft have both come to terms with the fact that people are simply never going to buy PCs — whether in desktop or laptop form, running Windows or macOS — in the old numbers that they used to. Computers are just too good nowadays, most users are already satisfied, and so the market for new PCs inevitably shrinks. And when you can’t have growth in total sales, the logical move is to try and improve the other multiplier in the profit calculation: the per-unit price and built-in profit margin. That's been Apple's approach for a while, and now Microsoft is joining in. If you can’t grow sales, grow the profit per sale Pure hardware providers like Intel, Acer, and Asus have no elegant means to escape the pursuit of "sell more stuff," but Apple and Microsoft’s software control gives them the opportunity to sell people holistic experiences and solutions. Yes, those are terrible buzzwords, but it’s true that Apple’s Touch Bar, fully integrated with macOS and the MacBook Pro’s design, delivers a unique experience. Just as it’s true that a Microsoft Surface Studio is only as appealing as it is because Microsoft has tailored the Windows software to support its on-screen drawing and touch capabilities, turning it into a wholly new creative solution. Read more: The PC has become part of the furniture Instead of thinking of such preposterous concepts as a post-PC world — which will only be precipitated by some apocalyptic event that wipes out all human progress and technology — we simply have to make ourselves comfortable with the notion that larger computers are returning to being a niche category. There's a compelling argument to be made that the average person's home computing needs are well met by their phone or a tablet. Mobile truly has eaten everything, and a very salient analogy is provided by cameras. Digital gives, and then it takes away; smartphones and cameras. Plenty of lessons here for other categories pic.twitter.com/8wHzvLwJuB — Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) February 12, 2015 Digital SLRs were once very expensive and therefore exclusive. After a while they proliferated into the market, underwent a rapid cycle of commodification that turned them into a ubiquity around tourists’ necks, and then cameraphones arrived on the scene along with high-quality mirrorless cameras and DSLRs quickly reverted to their smaller scale. The new DSLRs of today are things like the $1,999 Nikon D500. I call them tractors: the number of people that need one isn't huge, but they couldn't get their jobs done without it. PCs are much the same. It’s basic economics. Every publicly traded tech company is duty-bound to maximize profit, and the smart ones simply recognize when their opportunity to grow absolute sales numbers is at an end and then turn to creating high-premium devices instead. With mobile phones now supplanting so many of the original purposes of PCs, it’s high time for the personal computer itself to evolve. The Surface Studio gives people creative capabilities they’ve not had from any other desktop machine. The MacBook Pro is Apple’s best effort at crafting an ultraportable powerhouse, and its Touch Bar is again a unique bit of functionality. Maybe these things are gimmicks, we don’t yet know for sure, but they’re certainly necessary idiosyncrasies for justifying the introduction of anything new in such mature markets. New tech must prove itself an upgrade over old, and that task’s becoming more expensive For any new tech devices to exist and to prosper, they have to show themselves capable of doing things existing ones can’t. That used to be easy in the era of constantly advancing specs and software demanding more power, but all the easy upgrades are over now. Beside Apple and Microsoft, companies like Razer are pushing the design and pricing frontiers too, offering PCs like the $3,699 Razer Blade Pro with arguably the best laptop keyboard ever. The path forward is through a thicket of interesting, albeit also very expensive, design challenges. Apple is going in one direction, Microsoft is going in another, and the future of computers is harder to predict now than it has been for a while, because there’s no obvious next step. This makes developments exciting to observe, but the design and engineering exploration that is to come will come at a very literal cost.

X.Org To Begin Accepting Donations Again Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 28 October 2016 at 07:38 AM EDT. 14 Comments The X.Org merger with the SPI is almost complete and the X.Org Foundation is soon going to begin accepting donations. Years ago the X.Org Foundation relied upon donations from Sun Microsystems, Intel, and the other big names to assemble their war-chest, but in the past few years they haven't really been pursuing donations from these big companies while their expenditures have continued with the annual XDC conference, X.org EVoC, travel expenses, and other costs. Now under the SPI space, the X.Org Foundation is going to begin accepting donations. This time around they are soliciting donations via PayPal and thus seem to be going after random donations from individuals rather than the big money contributions from companies. They confirmed via yesterday's board meeting notes they are indeed accepting PayPal donations. Unfortunately though, there hasn't been an "annual report" from the X.Org Foundation since 2013, per their annual reports so the current financial health of the organization isn't clear. But at least via SPI there should be greater transparency and better organized moving forward... 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Last year, Microsoft made a splash with its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. This year, Redmond is simultaneously updating its Surface Book lineup and pushing its hardware in new directions. To-date, all of the Surface hardware has been focused on the laptop and ultraportable market (well, assuming you don’t count the original Microsoft Surface). Let’s start with the Surface Book, since that’s most similar to existing hardware on the market. According to Panos Pinay, the new Surface Book will have twice the graphics performance of its predecessor (which used a custom Nvidia GPU) and 30% more battery life. It uses an Intel Skylake chip, not the newer Kaby Lake, but the difference should be fairly small. Other features of the system, like its two-in-one design, custom hinge, and PixelSense touchscreen are identical between the two Surface Books. Microsoft is promising up to 16 hours of battery life — and that’s no small achievement for a laptop. Outwardly the new Surface Book looks much like the old Surface Book, but Microsoft has added a second cooling fan (this may also account for most of its performance improvements). Microsoft was willing to share more details about the 28-inch Surface Studio. This AIO packs a screen with 4,500×3,000 pixels in a 3:2 aspect ratio and a jaw-dropping 13.5 megapixels. That’s nearly 1.63x more pixels than you’d find in your average 4K monitor — though if I’m being honest, I’d question the need for such a high-resolution display. My own rule of thumb is that if you need to use screen magnification to use the panel, it’s resolution is too high already. 5K panels may make sense if you intend to edit 4K video, since the aspect ratio is the same, but a 3:2 aspect ratio doesn’t cleanly match a 16:9 source, even if the total number of pixels on the Surface Studio is slightly lower than in a 5K (5,120×2,880) panel. The system’s display is just 12.5mm thick (there are entire laptops much thicker than that). It can be manually adjusted to lie nearly flat if you want to use it for drawing or art, or can be mounted in a more traditional fashion. Microsoft is shipping a new hardware peripheral alongside the Surface Studio, dubbed the Surface Dial. The Dial can be used as a forward-and-back tool to step through a drawing. It can also be used to apply filters, change colors, and adjust other aspects of an image. The Surface Dial doesn’t have a dedicated UI interface of its own, Ars Technica reports — instead it seems to detect where it’s been placed and offers contextual options based on where it is on-screen. The Dial is also available for purchase as a stand-alone $99 device, and supports the Surface Pro 3, Pro 4, and the Surface Book. The Studio comes with a Dial packed in, alongside a Surface Mouse and Surface Keyboard. Unlike the new Surface Book, we actually know a number of the specifications for the Surface Studio. At the highest-end, the system will use a 270W integrated PSU, a 2TB “rapid” hard drive (implying either the use of a hybrid cache drive or at least a solid state hybrid drive), an Nvidia GTX 980M, 32GB of RAM, a Core i7 Skylake CPU, integrated 2.1 speakers, and a front-facing 5MP camera. In addition, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth, an SD card reader, 4x USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet jack, and a mini-DisplayPort connector are standard on all models. Over at Penny Arcade, Gabe has spent some time testing one of the lower-end Surface Studios, with a Core i5, Nvidia GTX 965M, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB drive. That’s the system Microsoft is debuting at $3,000. If you want the full fat configuration, it’ll cost you just over $4,000. Gabe, however, seems quite taken with the hardware. Microsoft’s persistent support problems When Microsoft announced the Surface RT and Surface Pro, the company was straightforward about its goals: Microsoft didn’t feel its various OEM partners had created solutions that showed off Windows 8 or RT to their best advantages, and it wanted to take the lead in building hardware that consumers would want to buy. Four years into that experiment, the results are decidedly mixed — especially if you factor in Microsoft’s habit of orphaning relatively new devices. Windows Phone 7 users got shafted by Windows Phone 8, and a number of Windows Phone 8 devices weren’t eligible for Windows 10 Mobile. Surface RT and Surface 2 both used ARM processors, and both were hung out to dry when Microsoft killed Windows RT. Nokia fans didn’t exactly get gentle treatment, either. Then there’s the hardware problems. From initially poor hinges on the Surface Book to issues with the Surface 4, to multiple rounds of battery trouble on the Surface Pro 3, the Surface products simply haven’t been quite as robust as Microsoft implied they were. Microsoft’s refusal to honor Panos Panay’s promise to replace dead Surface Pro 3 batteries for just $200 is particularly grating, given the old adage about waiting for Microsoft’s third version of a product before adopting it. Based on the company’s battery problems, I wouldn’t recommend a mobile Surface to anyone who plans to use the device for more than two years. Bill Belichick isn’t exactly a fan, either, though it’s not clear whether that’s the result of poor software, unreliable hardware, or user error. Granted, none of these problems are as serious as Lenovo’s decision to catastrophically break Windows security (on multiple occasions), or Samsung’s decision to block OS updates to protect its USB driver. But these issues shouldn’t still be plaguing a multi-billion dollar company with complete control of its own software stack and at least five years into designing its own hardware (while Microsoft announced Surface a bit over four years ago, development would’ve begun at least a year before that). There are plenty of happy Surface users out there, but the long-term issues that keep cropping up make it impossible for me to unilaterally recommend the product line.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

Flickr: JinkoSolar ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL) member JinkoSolar plans to build a 40MW solar PV plant in Vietnam, a company spokesperson has confirmed. The project will be located across 50 hectares in Phung Hiep district’s Hoa An commune in the Mekong Delta province. The spokesperson told PV Tech: ”It’s still an early stage project although we have received approval from the provincial government on the investment. The project will only proceed upon announcement of Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) program in Vietnam.” Reports surfaced this Autumn on the Vietnam government preparing legislation around subsidies for solar, having released a draft in 2015 and developing this further in the first half of the current year. These reports suggest that the FiT will be set at US$0.112/kWh for utility-scale grid-connected PV projects. Meanwhile rooftop solar will receive net metering credits of between US$0.15-0.18/kWh. Electricity Vietnam (EVN), the monopoly holding utility in Vietnam, will purchase all the power form such projects. Back in July, JinkoSolar signed its first power purchase agreements (PPAs) for solar PV projects outside China with 188MW of capacity ready to develop in Mexico.

Login / Register | Logout Gizmodo Indiamodo News Gadgets Science Design Software WTF Gallery Gizmodo X Login / Register | Logout Indiamodo News Gadgets Science Design Software WTF Gallery expand Bad Apple: Here’s why it should be providing adaptors with the MacBooks Sahil Mohan Gupta Oct 28, 2016, 11.48 AM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Image Credit Apple in typical fashion swooped in last evening and announced a new generation of its MacBook Pro laptop which is its flagship offering. Now, these are state of the art machines and are meant for professionals. In terms of hardware, these are possibly the best notebooks ever made with a new innovative new Touch Bar, the latest Intel processors and AMD’s polaris GPUs which offer up to 100 percent improvement in gaming performance. They also come with the largest track pad we’ve seen on a notebook, a better screen, and speakers – all in a package which is significantly slimmer and lighter. So what’s the problem? A paucity of ports. Just like the MacBook retina display and the new iPhone 7, Apple has killed the HDMI port, the standard USB, the magsafe connector and the old thunderbolt connector. Apple is known for its forward thinking approach and I don’t mind it. Even in the case of the iPhone 7 when it killed the 3.5mm jack, it had the decency to provide a 3.5mm to lightening adaptor and I didn’t mind it. When Apple didn’t provide adaptors in the case of the MacBook retina display which was an ultra-portable notebook aimed at a user who didn’t need many ports, this was understandable, but this time around, I don’t agree with the Cupertino based giant. Here’s why. 1. The most baffling bit is that if you’re an iPhone or iPad owner you can’t connect them to the new Macs as they use the standard USB while these machines come with the USB Type C connector. Again an adaptor is needed. What happened to Apple’s well know product synergy? 2. MacBook Pros are meant for professionals who are used to using standardised gear that they have been using for years. Removing the ports with the interoperable USB Type C port is a great idea on paper as it can be used as an HDMI or VGA or thunderbolt or USB, but when there are no ports legacy hardware becomes unusable on day one. A pro notebook is no use if these ports aren’t usable from the get go. People need to get shit done! 3. For notebooks that start in excess of Rs 1 lakh, not having an adaptor for the various ports is unforgivable. Apple is the richest company in the world, and this is a case of being cheap. Moreover, even a company like Asus provides an adaptor which can morph the single USB Type C connector into a hub for HDMI, USB and USB Type C – all at one time. Why can’t Apple do that? 4. These adaptors are also very expensive, especially when they come from Apple and they are a horrible way of getting work done. It is bad enough that you need to use an adaptor, you also need to shell out a lot of cash for them. Very bad indeed. 5. As I have seen with the fast inflow of USB Type C cables, most of these initially weren’t built to an industry standard specification and some of the cheap ones ended up damaging phones. If Apple doesn’t provide an adaptor in the market, the grey market will be quickly flooded with them which will be bad for the uninformed consumer who may risk damaging his machine with a faulty adaptor that Apple hasn’t certified. You need to just take a round of Beijing’s electronics market to know how many fake Apple goods are created and sold there. Heck, Delhi’s Nehru place wouldn’t be a bad start too.

And if you need to gift something to a geeky relative or friend, here are some interesting options for you. Fitbit Flex 2 Price: Rs7,599 (earlier Rs9,499) Amazon.in The recently-launched Fitbit Flex 2 is the successor to the Flex. Not only does it look slimmer but is more durable due to the water-proof exterior. You can take it out in rain or wear it while taking a swim. It provides activity tracking, sleep tracking, calorie counter and call and message notifications on the connected phone. You can see all your progress on the Fitbit app. Flex 2 works with both Android and iOS and provides a battery backup of up to five days. Asus Chromebit-B019C Price: Rs6,790 (earlier Rs7,999) Amazon.in How about gifting a complete PC to someone? Wait, no, we are not talking about that huge combination of a CPU, monitor and some assorted accessories with it. Asus Chromebit is a PC on stick on similar lines as Intel Stick, but runs Google’s Chrome OS and not Windows OS. It can connect with any monitor, or TV and convert it into a PC-running Chrome OS. It is powered by Rockchip quad-core RK3288C processor with 2 GB RAM and offers 16GB flash storage and 100GB of cloud storage. It is powerful enough for basic tasks. It supports WiFi so you can download Chrome apps and with Bluetooth compatibility can pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and use it for work. Skullcandy Uproar S5URHW-509 Price: Rs2,999 (earlier Rs5,999) Flipkart.com This is a wireless on-the-ear headphone which works with all Bluetooth-ready Android smartphones, Apple iPhones and iPods. It comes in grey black, uses a soft padding inside the earcups and is sweat-resistant. You can’t fold the head bar but you can stretch it to fit into big heads. It comes with a one-year warranty and if you own a CitiBank credit or debit card you can save up to 15% more through cashback offers. All-New Kindle E-reader Price: Rs4,989 (earlier Rs5,999) Amazon.in If you have an avid reader in the family, Kindle‘s entry-level model can be an interesting option. It doesn’t have a front-lit display like its more expensive sibling, the Kindle Paperwhite. The 6-inch glare-free e-ink display makes reading on it a lot more convenient than reading on a big-screen phone or tablet. It supports touch gestures which makes flipping pages or navigating a lot easier. It lasts a whole week on one charge and supports WiFi connectivity. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End Price: Rs2,650 (earlier Rs3,999) Amazon.in For game buffs with Sony PlayStation 4, this PlayStation-exclusive game is a solid time-killer. Developed by Naughty Dogs and published by Sony Interactive, the game was unveiled at the E3 gaming event early this year and was released worldwide in May 2016. This is a third person action adventure game where game protagonist Nathan Drake is on a treasure quest with his brother. The game’s rich graphics, string storyline and immersive gameplay make it one of the most popular games in the genre. There are talks about a movie on Uncharted 4, which will be directed by Stranger Things director Shawn Levy. Eon Qube Bluetooth Speaker Rs2,999 (earlier Rs4,995) Flipkart.com Eon Qube is a unique portable speaker designed like a cube, hence the name. It comes in a single black colour variant with plastic exterior. It can be used wirelessly and is compatible with all Android Smartphone and Apple iPhones with Bluetooth 3.0 and higher. The Bluetooth radius is 10 metres which means you can use it in large rooms. It comes with a microSD card slot, so you can play music without involving a smartphone. On a single charge, it can last four hours. Redgear Pro Series wireless gamepad Price: Rs1,099 (earlier Rs1,599) Amazon.in For PC gamers who are into football or racing games, a keyboard can never match the comfort that a game controller offers. Redgear’s Pro Series wireless controller for Windows PC offers all the buttons and controls that are available to a console user. It runs on a built-in battery that lasts up to 10 hours of non-stop gaming. The ABXY keys are backlit which makes using it in the dark easy. It weighs 470g and comes in black colour only. It works with Windows 7, 8 and 10.

Price $112 AUD 275GB $207 AUD 525GB $299 AUD 750GB $422 AUD 1TB > Pricing info Specs 3D NAND flash • 2.5-inch SATA 3 Tweet Email this Print this Feedback 3D NAND-based SSDs offer superb value. Micron; Crucial’s parent company, is the second to market with 3D NAND flash in a consumer SSD, which it developed with Intel. Samsung was the first, and uses its own implementation for the 850 Pro range. This Crucial product is shipping as a ‘Limited Edition’ SSD, because as Micron ramps up 3D NAND production it intends to diversify the range of products it’s used with to include M.2 SSDs along with SATA SSDs of different capacity. Indeed, the 750GB capacity we see here is an unusual size, and comes from the size of each memory chip multiplied by this desired sweet spot. This is a mid-range performance and budget-priced drive, and the price is phenomenal. At around $300 on the street, it equates to a remarkable .39c per GB, which is a new low for PCTA-reviewed SSDs. Performance isn’t compromised, Crucial state a top throughput of 530MB/s sequential read, and 510MB/s sequential write. We didn’t quite get there in testing, recording a still respectable 481MB/s read and 451MB/s write, on a new i5 6600K Z170 system with a fresh Windows 10 install.  You will want to be careful not to fill this drive to capacity as performance can slow if there isn’t enough ‘spare’ space on the drive to be used as a cache. For similar reasons it’s not a drive to use in a server, but for home use the performance is fine. Interestingly, 3D NAND has impressively low power consumption, with the MX300 needing a mere 0.075w, making it a smart choice for laptop use. With most budget SSDs now using (usually) slower TLC chips, having a competitively priced 3D NAND product available makes it a choice to consider. The large capacity makes it very appealing as an app or games drive added to existing systems that may have a smaller OS SSD.  Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority. All rights reserved.

Unveiled Today The Mac maker's product event was more or less entirely expected. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 27, 2016 at 8:05PM Image source: Apple. Well, would you look at that. For once, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled something that wasn't entirely expected at its Mac event earlier today. Ahead of the unveiling, the rumors had narrowed in on three new MacBook models, and no iMac refresh. While new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros were obvious, it wasn't entirely clear what the other rumored 13-inch MacBook would be. Some thought it would be a new MacBook Air with USB-C ports. As it turns out, it was just another 13-inch MacBook Pro instead of a tweaked Air. Three's company As expected, the new MacBook Pros feature a dynamic display above the keyboard, replacing the traditional function keys with a versatile toolbar that can change contextually. Apple calls this the Touch Bar, and it can morph into various different tools and buttons depending on what task you're doing or what application you're using. Integrated into the right side of the Touch Bar is a small second-generation Touch ID sensor, finally bringing Apple's fingerprint recognition technology to the Mac. This can be used to unlock the computer, switch user profiles, or use Apple Pay on the web for websites that have adopted Apple's payment service. Image source: Apple. Intel's six-generation Skylake chips are onboard at long last, bringing the MacBook Pro lineup up to speed in a much-needed upgrade. The Mac maker is moving toward Thunderbolt 3 ports, which include support for USB-C and a wide range of other protocols. And yes, there is a headphone jack. The keyboard is similar to the 12-inch MacBook, using a second generation of Apple's butterfly mechanism. Naturally, this is the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro Apple has ever made. (Stop me if you've heard that one before.) The surprise move was that Apple is making a version without the Touch Bar and Touch ID, instead using traditional function keys, but still within the new chassis. There are also only two Thunderbolt 3 ports as opposed to four. The 13-inch MacBook Pro that has traditional function keys will start at $1,499, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at $1,799. That $300 premium is a hefty ask for what amounts to a small display (which is presumably OLED based on rumors, but Apple did not specify) and a Touch ID sensor. All 15-inch models include the Touch Bar and Touch ID and start at $2,399. Other Macs continue to age There was no mention of updates for any other Macs. The Mac Mini is still incredibly old, with the last upgrade being two years ago. The Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013. There was some speculation that Apple would update the iMac 5K with new graphics processors from AMD, but nope. The 27-inch iMac 5K already uses the latest Intel chips, and appropriate desktop-class seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips simply aren't ready yet. This event was all about the MacBook Pro. As the most important product within the Mac lineup, hopefully the new laptops will help Apple's Mac business grow again after losing share for the past two to three quarters.

Well into Microsoft's Windows 10 event on Oct. 26 in New York City, Panos Panay, head of Microsoft devices, took the wraps off the Surface Studio, an all-in-one Windows 10 PC aimed at creative professionals. "This product will help you bring your ideas to life," he said. "It is all fundamentally made to immerse you into the content or to the creation that you want to work with." The PC is powered by Intel's sixth-generation Core i5 or i7 processors and can be configured with up to 32 gigabytes of RAM on the i7 model and up to 2 terabytes of "rapid hybrid drive" storage. Prices start at $2,999 for a Core i5 Surface Studio with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. According to Microsoft's online store, the device begins shipping on Dec. 15, but Panay cautioned on stage that it will be "available in limited quantities this holiday." Apple's fourth-quarter revenue and net income fell compared to the same period one year ago, but rose from the third quarter of this year as the company continues to navigate competitive and unpredictable global market conditions. For the full year of 2016, Apple reported revenue of $215.6 billion and net income of $45.7 billion, lower than the $233.7 billion in revenue and $53.4 billion in net income posted for 2015. This is the first full-year revenue decline that Apple has recorded since 2001, the year the company introduced the iPod media player and six years before it introduced the iPhone. For the fourth-quarter ending Sept. 24, Apple brought in $46.9 billion in revenue and $9 billion in net income, down from the $51.5 billion and $11.1 billion in the same quarter one year ago. Judge Charles Breyer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Oct. 25 granted final approval for a massive settlement of just under $15 billion for using software in the computers that control the Diesel engines in some of its vehicles that allowed those cars to cheat on emissions tests. Volkswagen has begun the process of buying back cars containing the offending engines. The decision is the result of revelations in September 2015, in which researchers found that Volkswagen vehicles with 2-liter Diesel engines produced far more pollutants when driven on the road then they did when undergoing emissions tests. The settlement means that VW will either fix the illegal engines or it will buy the cars back from owners who had purchased what they believed were efficient "clean" diesels. Small tags embedded with Bluetooth Low Energy have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way for consumers to track things such as car keys or other small items. There is only one small problem: They're also potentially a larger public privacy risk, according to new research released Oct. 25 by security firm Rapid7. Among the trackers Rapid7 looked at is the TrackR Bravo device, which was found to have four unique vulnerabilities, including cleartext password storage, Tracking ID exposure, unauthenticated access and unauthentic pairing vulnerabilities. Rapid7 conducted its operational analysis of the Bluetooth tracking products by using multiple tools, including Burpsuite, to intercept communication between the cloud and mobile applications.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

By chuq | Published Oct 29 2016 Apple finally (drink!) announced the updated MacBook Pro computers and the refreshed laptop line that will carry them forward for the next year or so. As expected, these new computers include Skylake CPUs with support for USB C and the newer, faster, Thunderbolt 3 interfaces and improved monitors with the wide color capabilities. I bought one immediately after the event, and I’ll have it in hand in a couple of weeks. Am I happy with it? Yes. But… There’s a huge amount of criticism of Apple coming out online after this event. And there’s a lot to criticize Apple about, unfortunately, because while they updated these laptops, they didn’t even mention the rest of the Mac product line, and the huge questions about where Apple sees this line going over the next few years weren’t even acknowledged, much less addressed. And I think that’s a big problem. I like the new MacBooks. I think some of the criticism of them is unjustified. I think much of the criticism is misplaced anger at other things Apple is doing (or isn’t). But I think most of the criticism is an indication of larger problems Apple simply hasn’t acknowledged, much less worked to resolve. Things like… Where did the low-end macs go? They became iPads. Apple has never been afraid of cannibalizing a product with another product, and with the new MacBooks, we see the result here. Low end laptops? Basically, gone. My guess is this isn’t Apple pushing this change, but following a change that already exists in their sales numbers. And that has an interesting implication for the Mac line: I’m old enough to remember when the “personal computer” was a niche, nerdy product, and I’ve now lived long enough to see the age of the personal computer begin the downward slide back into being that niche, nerdy product again. What is Apple’s long-term strategy for pro apps? To be honest, Final Cut seems like a prosumer app that is used by pros, not a pro app that’s used by prosumers. What’s the future of Logic? they’ve killed Aperture, is it next? Am I going to be pushed to Premiere and Audition in the next two years? I hope not, but to be honest, I’m starting to think about what that would take for me to do, because right now, I have no idea if I can depend on the pro apps moving forward, because Apple won’t say anything and the last year or so of updates and improvements hasn’t been encouraging. I’m worried, because of the poor hardware situation and the — muted — improvements to the pro line in the last 18 months that Apple has decided these are too niche to invest in, and so they’re just moving them into the same path Aperture lived on for so long. Where are the updates to the desktop line? Where are the developer-class macs? And what about users who need high hardware with larger memory configurations? These new laptops all max out at 16Gb which is fine for, I’d wager, 95% of users, but for that other 5%? Is Apple really suggesting they head off to Microsoft instead? Apple needs to sort this out before WWDC, or I wouldn’t want to be wearing an Apple badge at the conference, because it’ll be a non-stop yell-fest. Or more correctly, I’m sure they do have it sorted out and it’s probably on Phil Schiller’s whiteboard in his office, but Apple has to tell its users how it’s sorted out — because more and more I’m hearing these users taking a serious look at alternatives, and I expect many are going to start jumping ship. Microsoft is an option again That’s because Microsoft has gotten its act together, and they showed some really interesting products as well. It’s clear Microsoft has decided it can compete with Apple — and win — in the creative professional world that Apple has been a strength in for decades, and I think Microsoft is right here. I like seeing the Microsoft has finally figured it out and is innovating again. I like that they’re taking Apple on and pushing Apple. The similarities and differences between the new MacBooks with the Touch Bar and the Surface are fascinating; two very different philosophies to solving the same basic problem. Which one will win? I have no idea, and when was the last time we saw technological innovation into a problem where we really didn’t know what the right approach was? This is great. But if Apple thought it’s new MacBook pros were going to push back against Microsoft and it’s drive to bring over the creative professionals, they were wrong. So far, Apple hasn’t reacted to Microsoft. Instead, this looks like a retrenchment to me, retreating into a safe spot in the product area while jettisoning niches — going to where the numbers are based on sales, and simply abandoning groups that don’t fit that mass mainstream population. Unfortunately, they’re abandoning some of their strongest proponents and evangelists, and in some ways, also abandoning a key component, their developers. That’s potentially disastrous. Don’t hit us! We are really committed to accessibility! I love that Apple is so committed to accessibility, and their opening video was awesome in showing some of the things they’re doing to bring the Apple to all. And yet… in the larger context of the event, why was it there? And given the big issues users have been complaining about — the lack of an updated Mini, the lack of an updated Mac Pro, the chaos and neglect of the entire Desktop line, in honesty — wouldn’t they have been better off spending 15 minutes talking about the state of the Mac and some kind of roadmap explaining when these issues were going to be resolved? But no, this is Apple, and Apple doesn’t roadmap, and it certainly never admits that there are problems it hasn’t solved yet, even if the problem is out of their control, and so they did the entire event with an 500 pound elephant on stage that was never acknowledge or fed a single peanut. And so to me, my reaction to the accessibility video ended up significantly reduced, because it came across as trying to prove what great people they were while they were very loudly refusing to deal with the problems much of their audience wanted to know about. I think Apple’s game of holding information close to its chest and not sharing served itself well, but I also think there are times when you have to realize that’s the wrong thing to do, and in this case, they made the mistake of not acknowledging all of the problems within the Mac product line and talking about it, at least in generalities. And that’s left a sour taste in the mouth of many Mac Faithful, including me. But it’s so not Apple, not it’s core DNA. And honestly, spending ten minutes admitting the Mac product line is still a shambles but it’ll take them a few more months to sort out wouldn’t be hard. All it takes is a bit of courage (drink!), and Apple didn’t show any in this event. They spent their time talking about two really interesting trees while completely ignoring the forest dying of drought all around them. And I think the Apple user community has about had enough of Apple and it’s showing in the feedback we’re seeing online. My bottom line on the event My bottom line: Satisfaction with the hardware, and the new 13” MacBook hits my sweet spot, so I grabbed one. But I came away with a much bigger sense of frustration because of Apple’s unwillingness to admit the Mac product line is a cluster and their users and supporters need some re-assurance that it’s being fixed. Instead, we got a couple of new laptops and the rest of the dumpster fire was sitting there unacknowledged as if it doesn’t exist. That’s a typical Apple behavior, but one I’m rather tired of being on the wrong end of. It’s time for Apple to take a long and hard look at how they communicate with their users, supporters, evangelists and developers and realize times have changed. If Microsoft is a legitimate alternative, you’re going to see more and more people start to take that option, because they have no idea when or if Apple will resolve the issues and with Microsoft, you have some understanding of how things are going to move forward. Roadmaps matter. My New MacBook Enough ranting. Immediately after the announcements, I went and bought the 13” MacBook Pro with the touch bar, with upgraded CPU, 16GB of memory and the 1TB SSD. In Space Gray, of course. Why? My old laptop is a 2013 model and going on four years old. That is, I believe, the longest I’ve held a Mac before upgrading, but in reality, it’s chugging along pretty well with a few inconveniences. That I’m happy holding on to hardware this long is an indication of a key change in the Mac product space: these units have, by and large, hit that “good enough” point where there isn’t much motivation to upgrade, because the changes are smaller and more evolutionary. [Update: I grabbed the wrong CPU benchmark; my bad. Updated this to the corrected info — it’s not doubled, it’s roughly the same as my current Laptop, but since I’m going from the top end 15″ model to a 13″ model, that’s really what I was expecting in the first place — chuq] I could stick with this device for another year or two and not feel too bad about it, too, but I’m making the shift for a few reasons: Skylake CPUs: I get the new generation CPU, and I get to upgrade from a 2.3Ghz I7 to a 3.3GHz i7. According to the Passmark benchmarks, the CPU benchmark scores are very close. GPU upgrade: A shift from the GeForce GT 750m to the built in Intel Iris Graphics 550. Passmark says this change will be about a 25% improvement. Now, components are not a system so it’s really about how this all works together. I’m upgrading to a bigger, faster SSD in the unit, which should notably help performance. Memory size stays at 16Gbytes, but the speed of the memory increases from 1600MHz to 2133MHz, so that should lead to a performance boost as well. So overall, there seems to be some nice speed increases in this new computer, but that’s not why I’m doing this: I’ve found in the last few years that I really wanted a smaller and lighter computer than my MacBook pro 15”. The only time I need the big screen is on the road, and even then, with retina screens it’s not that big a deal as it used to be. But the smaller screen of the 13” also makes this a lighter machine, and I’ll be going from 4.5 pounds to 3 pounds. That’s a lot nicer on a couch or in a hotel room or on my shoulder. Moving to the smaller form factor is a huge win for me today, especially since I can do so without sacrificing overall performance compared to my existing machine, and a primary reason I went 15” in 2013 was horsepower; that gap has narrowed with the new models. I can’t wait to see geek bench numbers on these things. On top of that, I get a better retina screen with wide color — and the minute I saw wide color on the iPad, I was hooked, and for my photography, this is huge. And I get Touch ID, and the touch strip, which I’m really looking forward to working with to see if I like it as much as I expect to. Outfitting the new beast Now that I’ve committed to the new computer, I’m considering how that will impact my working spaces and how I need to make changes. The first big one: I’ve traditionally used the laptop closed and docked using a vertical holder, but with the Touch Bar and Touch-ID, I think it’s insane to keep the laptop closed. that means shifting to a different dock, and so I’ve gotten the Twelve South ParcSlope. Switching to this will involve re-arranging my entire desk environment, of course. This shift to USB C will require changing how stuff connects, but solving this is simpler than it seems (I think). I’m right now leaning towards the CalDigit USB-C Docking Station which will give me charging, old USB compatibility, display and speaker connections — pretty much turning hooking into the desktop into a two cable experience instead of 3, because you no longer need a separate charging cable plugged in. The Caldisk will then connect into my existing USB hub, and life will be gravy (I hope). The other cable? thunderbolt to my external disk, and for now, I’ll just use the existing drive with an adaptors or an updated cable. I also need to update my travel bag. Here in some ways there’s great news, because instead of having to carry two big charger blocks (Mac and USB), I can convert to one, saving space and weight. Anker has a nice one that’ll charge everything out of one charger, and this, to me, is a nice improvement. On the road connectivity? It looks like the Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter solves the problem pretty well and has great reviews. I’m also considering whether I want the portable version as well for coffee shop usage, and if I so, it’ll likely be the Satechi Type-C USB 3.0 3 in 1 Combo Hub. And yes, I bought a couple of dongles. I know there’s a lot of snide snarking going on about dongles, but, you know what? when I buy a new car, I outfit it with some customizations like chains that cost extra because the chains from my old car won’t fit, and I don’t see reason to complain about that. That’s what this is all about, really — customizing a tool to me specific needs. It’s part of the reality of taking a tool and making it my tool for my needs. Not that this will stop people from snarking, of course. But I think it’s silly, unless you honestly think a computer should be made specifically for how you want to do things, and ignore the reality that every one of us has a different definition of that. So I think I know what I need to make my new computer feel at home, and once I sorted it all out, it was less complex than I was worried about. We’ll see how it works in practice. One more thing One other things I did immediately after the event: I went onto Amazon and bought a 3 pack of Eero wifi hubs to replace my Airports. Apple has neglected other parts of their product lines, including their Airports and Time Capsules, and I’d decided if I didn’t hear about possible updates or some kind of roadmap, it was time to jump ship and move on — and so I have. I think we all have to think about where we stand with Apple if we’re using or depending on niche products. With monitors, Apple announced a partnership with LG instead of a new monitor, and later confirmed that it was out of the monitor business. I think you can take that as an indication of how it’s going to handle other products that are now niche products where Apple isn’t a dominant player, and the Wifi world long ago moved on from Apple; I’ve stuck with it for one reason: ease of use, but the Eero devices seem to have that solved in ways even better than Apple. I get the distinct feeling that Apple simple doesn’t care about the Airport any more, and I’m not willing to wait on zero information to find out otherwise. And as Apple users, we all need to take a look at where we are using Apple gear and ask ourselves if Apple still cares about those things. If not, it’s time to start thinking about upgrading away from Apple to something from a vendor that cares about the product. And then there’s that bigger, difficult question: is the Mac product line itself a niche, and has Apple started losing interest in it? Unfortunately, Apple punted on resolving that worry with us at the event, and it’s clear we’ll get no more answers about it until after the first of the year. And so when I look at people who’ve been faithful to Apple who are now considering jumping ship, all I can say is “I understand, I don’t blame you”, because Apple’s done nothing to resolve the worries we have about where this is all headed, and I can’t blame people for choosing to not wait for Apple to actually do something about it any more. And that’s a problem I don’t see Apple as having really seen, much less come to grips with. But if they’re paying attention to the reaction to these announcements, they should, and I hope they do something to settle the ruffled feathers out in the user community. But this is Apple, and so I don’t expect to hear anything until they make the next announcements. Hopefully it won’t be too late for many of you.

The business was originally part of Softwin, a company founded by chief executive Florin Talpes and his wife Mariuca in Bucharest in 1989, the year of Romania’s anti-communist revolution, when he worked as a researcher in a computer science institute. Mr Talpes developed anti-virus software to protect against threats coming from Bulgaria, a common source of viruses in the 1990s. He spun off the operation from Softwin in 2007 and Bitdefender now claims to have a presence in more than 100 countries. The company’s rivals include Norton, owned by American company Symantec, McAfee, part of Intel, Kaspersky of Russia, Trend Micro and Sophos. It claims to have its technologies installed on more than 500m devices in homes and offices across the world. Bitdefender had revenues of $74.7m in 2014 and the company is now wholly owned by Mr Talpes. “Bitdefender’s strategy is to go public in the near future,” he told The Sunday Telegraph. “Therefore in 2017 we plan to attract a minority investor in the company. We haven’t made a decision regarding which stock exchange we will go with, and the London Stock Exchange is not excluded.” Last week financial software supplier Misys postponed its stock market return, blaming “market conditions”.Budget gyms operator Pure Gym also delayed flotation plans recently.

Essays & Reviews Features Blogs &, Meanwhile News Magazine Archive Shop About   Mapping the Sneakernet By An Xiao Mina Digital media travels hand to hand, phone to phone across vast cartographies invisible to Big Data I stood at the corner of Market Street and 4th Avenue, at the edge of San Francisco’s technology-startup neighborhood. An older Chinese woman—let’s call her Fei—approached my friend and me, asking for directions in her extremely limited English. In her hands was a piece of paper with directions from Google Maps, to a location somewhere much further south in the city. “One second,” I said. “We’ll check the address.” My friend pulled out his phone and punched in the English language address of her destination into a maps app and received a few public-transit options for how to get there. I asked Fei if she had a phone so I could send her the information, but she said, “I just have a pen.” I ended up writing down the directions on the back of her printout and wished her luck, pointing her in the direction of the bus she needed and double-checking my orientation with my phone’s compass app. In traditional tech parlance, a phoneless woman like Fei would be considered one of the 4.3 billion who are said to be unconnected to the Internet. The International Telecommunications Union, a branch of the United Nations, measures connectivity via fixed landline, mobile, or broadband subscriptions. Cisco’s Visual Networking Index measures global mobile data traffic to gauge growth in usage. McKinsey and Co.’s research defines the offline population as those who haven’t gone online in the past 12 months. Following the implicit logic of such statistics, it can be easy to assume that being unconnected means having no exposure to the Internet at all. Phrases like “connecting the unconnected,” “the next billion,” and “the digital divide” all suggest this binary: One either has access to the Internet or doesn’t; one lives on the wired side of the tracks or one doesn’t. But as tech ethnographer Jan Chipchase wrote recently, “Connectivity is not binary. The network is never neutral.” Between those who’ve never touched a computer and those who get a feed of data directly into their Google Glass sits a vast array of modes and methods of connectivity. The most commonly-discussed of these is shared access. Just as a family in the rich world might share a television, families in the developing world often share devices and telecom accounts. In rural Luzon, the largest island of the Philippines, I’ve seen groups of people access the internet via Facebook. One person—the one who is formally connected and counted–has the account, but many others are able to see their feed, access web sites, hear and tell stories from abroad and around the country. Shared access is often overlooked in connectivity studies but has been documented in India, Peru and many other countries. Beyond shared usage, there are other, more informal methods of accessing what the web has to offer, extending through urban areas in developed countries through rural areas in the global south. Fei’s ability to navigate the city depended on the Internet—a printout from Google Maps, and then my friend’s Internet connection to update it. Chances are, if she got lost again, a non-Chinese speaker with machine translation software could try to help her figure out what was going on. To call her unconnected would be to ignore the many forms of connectivity and social support around her that effectively enabled her to access data from the web. And there are countless others like her, extending across “unconnected” parts of the world. Both informal communities in urban areas and rural locales in developing countries often feel like the edge of the Internet, where the next billion are just starting to come online. But, first, to understand the edges, it helps to understand the center and how the concept of “connectivity” is constructed. * * * The Internet can feel ubiquitous in both developed and developing parts of the world, but those who access the web directly are a privileged minority. For many people reading this essay, the Internet looks like a wi-fi icon in the upper right hand corner of their screen or an ethernet cable with one end plugged into a computer and another plugged into a wall. But what happens after the wall is unclear, presumed to be in the hands of professionals. In Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet, author Andrew Blum focuses on the other side of the wall, beginning with a simple anecdote of a squirrel that chews a wire and cuts off his Internet in Brooklyn, leaving him effectively unconnected until the repair technician could come to his home. From this experience, he moves on to detail the server farms, exchange points, data engineers, and construction workers that maintain the world’s connectivity. Despite the ridicule heaped on Senator Ted Stevens’s now infamous description of the Internet as a “series of tubes,” the Internet, Blum demonstrates, is actually filled with tubes: fiber-optic tubes, Ethernet tubes, power tubes, transatlantic tubes that mirror the telegraph cables that were strung between London and New York in the 19th century. “The undersea cables,” he writes, “showed how that new geography was traced entirely upon the outlines of the old.” Blum reveals that the web is made not of spider’s silk but miles and miles of machinery, each part built as a result of complex decisions and layers. He illustrates how the forces of geography, politics and economics combine to affect the world’s access to bandwidth: Undersea cables link people—in rich nations, first—but the earth itself always stands in the way. To determine the route of an undersea cable requires navigating a maze of economics, geopolitics, and topography. For example, the curvature of the planet makes the shortest distance between Japan and the United States a northern arc paralleling the coast of Alaska and landing near Seattle. But Los Angeles has traditionally been the bigger producer and consumer of bandwidth, exerting a southward tug on earlier cables. With TGN-Pacific, Tyco solved the problem the expensive way, by building both. Tubes, of course, are not the only way data travels on the Internet: The electromagnetic waves of mobile and wi-fi networks pass invisibly through us, broadcast by towers powered by electric wires or diesel. Tubes highlights how much of the Internet consists of very physical data handoffs, storage and routing, all powered by human decisions and relationships. Blum’s writing soars when his earnest fascination with this comes to the fore, as when he describes walking around New York City: I was captivated by the idea of the light [of fiber optic cables] pulsing beneath the streets. Climbing down the steps into the subway, I’d imagine the red lights sticking out of the concrete decking. This was the municipal corollary to what was going on inside the [network] router. But it wasn’t the realm of egghead engineers, their glasses reflecting with strings of numbers. It was about thick bundles of cable and dirty streets—an even heavier reality. I started to wonder just how that light got in the ground. Still, it can be easy to assume, after reading Blum’s book, that where no tubes or electromagnetic waves flow, no Internet goes. But just outside the book’s scope, the connectivity binary begins to break down. The very story he starts with—a squirrel nibbling away at his tether to the larger world—misses the alternate ways he had to get a message out, to download movies, to access a map. He just had to ask his neighbor, assuming he couldn’t get online through his phone. And if his neighbors didn’t have Internet access, they could have asked their neighbors. Data spill forth from the tubes, carried along on USB drives or through word-of-mouth exchange, mobile Bluetooth handoffs, and “sneakernets” of data transferred hand to hand, foot by foot. If there was a sequel to Tubes, it might be called Sticks, Mouths, Teeth, and Sneakers. * * * In the dry season of 2013, I visited Aber and Atura, small villages tucked away between Gulu and Lira, the two largest cities in Northern Uganda, each with a population of a few hundred thousand. I conducted this visit as part of my graduate research at Art Center College of Design, with support from UNICEF Uganda’s Innovation Lab and Intel Labs’s Interaction and Experience Research Group. I am grateful to Aber Youth Center and research associate Daniel Nanghaka. Accessible via an hour-long bike ride from the nearest paved highway, Aber and Atura have a few hundred people each and, like much of the region, they have no running electricity or water (electric wires are strung along some roads but are not connected to the grid). Young women hike miles in each direction to pick up water for their families, and as night descends, families light torches and campfires to prepare food by mud and wattle huts. Satellite photos of the region show darkness, but satellites can’t capture the soft glow of a mobile phone. Many residents use their phones to text their friends and keep in touch. Mobile-phone towers dot the landscape, providing 3G Internet access to those who can afford it (a small minority) and SMS/voice access for the others (a larger minority). They power their phones at mobile charging stations set up by enterprising families who invest about $100 to $200 for a solar panel manufactured in India or China. Nor can satellites hear the music. At night, residents turn on their radios, and those who can afford Chinese feature phones play mp3s. One day, I heard familiar lyrics: Hey, I just met you And this is crazy But here’s my number So call me maybe I turned my head. A number of young people gathered around a woman rocking out to Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe,” a song that owes so much of its success to the viral power of YouTube and Justin Bieber. The phone’s owner wasn’t accessing it via the Internet. Rather, she had an mp3 acquired through a Bluetooth transfer with a friend. Indeed, the song was just one of many media files I saw on people’s phones: There were Chinese kung fu movies, Nigerian comedies, and Ugandan pop music. They were physically transferred, phone to phone, Bluetooth to Bluetooth, USB stick to USB stick, over hundreds of miles by an informal sneakernet of entertainment media downloaded from the Internet or burned from DVDs, bringing media that’s popular in video halls—basically, small theaters for watching DVDs—to their own villages and huts. Video halls have a long and documented history in Northern Uganda, dating back to the civil war, when people watched VHS films in small rooms. In geographic distribution charts of Carly Rae Jepsen’s virality, you’d be hard pressed to find impressions from this part of the world. Nor is this sneakernet practice unique to the region. On the other end of continent, in Mali, music researcher Christopher Kirkley has documented a music trade using Bluetooth transfers that is similar to what I saw in northern Uganda. These forms of data transfer and access, though quite common, are invisible to traditional measures of connectivity and Big Data research methods. Like millions around the world with direct internet connections, young people in “unconnected” regions are participating in the great viral products of the Internet, consuming mass media files and generating and transferring their own media. Indeed, the practice of sneakernets is global, with political consequences in countries that try to curtail Internet access. In China, I saw many activists trading media files via USB sticks to avoid stringent censorship and surveillance. As Cuba opens its borders to the world, some might be surprised that citizens have long been able to watch the latest hits from United States, as this Guardian article notes. Sneakernets also apparently extend into North Korea, where strict government policy means only a small elite have access to any sort of connectivity. According to news reports, Chinese bootleggers and South Korean democracy activists regularly smuggle media on USB sticks and DVDs across the border, which may be contributing to increasing defections, as North Korean citizens come to see how the outside world lives. Blum imagines the Internet as a series of rivers of data crisscrossing the globe. I find it a lovely visual image whose metaphor should be extended further. Like water, the Internet is vast, familiar and seemingly ubiquitous but with extremes of unequal access. Some people have clean, unfettered and flowing data from invisible but reliable sources. Many more experience polluted and flaky sources, and they have to combine patience and filters to get the right set of data they need. Others must hike dozens of miles of paved and dirt roads to access the Internet like water from a well, ferrying it back in fits and spurts when the opportunity arises. And yet more get trickles of data here and there from friends and family, in the form of printouts, a song played on a phone’s speaker, an interesting status update from Facebook relayed orally, a radio station that features stories from the Internet. Like water from a river, data from the Internet can be scooped up and irrigated and splashed around in novel ways. Whether it’s north of the Nile in Uganda or south of Market St. in the Bay Area, policies and strategies for connecting the “unconnected” should take into account the vast spectrum of ways that people find and access data. Packets of information can be distributed via SMS and mobile 3G but also pieces of paper, USB sticks and Bluetooth. Solar-powered computer kiosks in rural areas can have simple capabilities for connecting to mobile phones’ SD cards for upload and download. Technology training courses can start with a more nuanced base level of understanding, rather than assuming zero knowledge of the basics of computing and network transfer. These are broad strokes, of course; the specifics of motivation and methods are complex and need to be studied carefully in any given instance. But the very channels that ferry entertainment media can also ferry health care information, educational material and anything else in compact enough form. There are many maps for the world’s internet tubes and the electric wires that power them, but, like any map, they reflect an inherent bias, in this case toward a single user, binary view of connectivity. This view in turn limits our understanding of just how broad an impact the Internet has had on the world, with social, political and cultural implications that have yet to be fully explored. One critical addition to understanding the internet’s global impact is mapping the many sneakernets that crisscross the “unconnected” parts of the world. The next billion, we might find, are already navigating new cities with Google Maps, trading Korean soaps and Nigerian comedies, and rocking out to the latest hits from Carly Rae Jepsen.

Picture: Munish Sharma Thomas Malthus was wrong for one simple reason. Humans have survived his 1798 forecast that growing populations wouldn't be able to feed themselves because innovation and productivity gains allowed them to produce more and more with the same amount of labour and capital: Irrigation, fertilizers, higher-yielding plant species and mechanisation have enabled farmers to grow 5 to 6 times the amount of grain from the same piece of land as a century ago. The problem is that similar productivity gains may no longer be possible -- or effective. There's general agreement about the factors that improve productivity. Investment in machinery and equipment increases production levels and quality. Education and training improve worker skills. New products, technologies, organisational structures and work arrangements - in other words, innovation - raise efficiency. A healthy climate for entrepreneurship and competition encourages the creation of faster, smarter businesses. Unfortunately, there's also general agreement that productivity gains are flatlining. In advanced economies, productivity growth has fallen below 1 percent annually, significantly lower than the 3 to 4 percent common in postwar decades and even less than the 2 to 2.5 percent of the last decades of the 20th century. Similar trend lines are beginning to appear in developing nations. Combined with stagnant or declining workforces, slowing productivity gains are a key factor suppressing growth worldwide. What no one can agree on is why this is happening. Some economists think traditional measures designed for manufacturing-heavy economies simply aren't detecting productivity gains in services, or the effect of newer, information-intensive technologies. There's also a natural lag between the introduction of new technologies and their full effect. It may simply be too soon to see productivity improvements. Fundamental issues Yet such factors have always been present to some degree; they'd also have affected earlier productivity estimates. The real issues are more fundamental - and intractable. Take the shift from manufacturing to services. The latter may not lend themselves to improvements as easily as industrial processes. They can't all be automated. Many are local and not globally traded, and so don't benefit from international supply chains. It's hard to improve on certain personal services. A one-hour massage always takes one hour. The non-routine and non-repetitive tasks involved in, say, healthcare and aged care can't easily be sped up. The immense gains in education and skills over the last 50 years may not be repeatable. Rising costs have placed higher education beyond the reach of many. They've also forced graduates to start their working lives with significant debts, undercutting the attractiveness of going to college. The rise in contract or part-time jobs has contributed to de-skilling, since workers have little incentive to invest in training. A lack of retraining means that the skill levels of older workers -- a rising share of the workforce - quickly become dated. Many "new" manufacturing technologies are already being extensively exploited. New energy technologies, such as fracking and renewables, aren't breakthroughs comparable to the discovery of hydrocarbons or electricity itself; they require certain conditions, such as high oil prices, to be efficient. Many biotech, IT and financial innovations are focused on lifestyle, longevity, consumption and entertainment -- all of which have limited productivity benefits. In many ways and many places, it's becoming harder to start and grow businesses. Regulations and class-action lawsuits have made doing business more complex and expensive. Anti-competitive behaviour makes life tough for would-be disrupters, even in the technology sector. There's now one major chipmaker (Intel), a few hardware makers, two dominant computer operating systems (Microsoft's Windows and Apple), two dominant mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) and one major suite of business software (Microsoft's Office). Cloud computing is the preserve of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The internet is dominated by Google (search), Amazon (e-commerce) and Facebook (social networks). Among established companies, the frequently short tenures of chief executives and pressure to show short-term results work against productivity gains. Financial engineering to boost share prices is favoured over risky, longer-term initiatives such as research and development or staff training. And finally, since 2008, unconventional monetary policies have clearly distorted the economy. Low interest rates have impeded the shift of capital from inefficient to more efficient enterprises or industries, allowing unproductive businesses to live on. This has left capital tied up in marginal firms and restricted the supply of credit to smaller, often more innovative companies. Any benefit? Even if productivity growth could be revived, it's not clear those gains would have as much of an impact on living standards as in the past. Simply being able to make more stuff isn't terribly helpful in an era of excess capacity and also weak aggregate demand. Many innovations actually eliminate jobs and depress wages. They allow a few creators to capture large benefits but don't aid the majority of the population. A much-quoted study from Oxford University found that 47 percent of all jobs are threatened by automation. In 1967, Boeing employed 400 workers per each aircraft produced. By 2015, that number had dropped to 113 workers per aircraft, a decline of 72 percent. The company believes that the worker-to-aircraft ratio can be reduced another 60 percent in the next 20 years. Fewer workers mean even less demand. Given that consumption makes up 60 to 70 percent of economic activity in developed economies, productivity gains may thus depress rather than boost growth. Even if the world can solve this one conundrum, plenty more questions -- about employment, income and inequality - await. - Das is a former banker, whom Bloomberg named one of the world's 50 most influential financial figures in 2014.

Maui 2 "Blue Tang" Linux Still Based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ships KDE Plasma 5.8.2 GO It now uses its own software repositories and Calamares Oct 29, 2016 00:45 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Do you remember Maui? It's the new name gave by the Netrunner team to their Netrunner Desktop flavor earlier this summer, rebased on KDE Neon and shipping with the latest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) goodies. The first Maui release, versioned 1, landed in mid-August, and we've just been informed about the general availability of Maui 2, dubbed "Blue Tang," featuring the recently released KDE Plasma 5.8.2 LTS desktop environment on top of an updated Ubuntu 16.04 LTS base, and, of course, running the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel. Maui 2 also ships with the latest KDE Applications 16.08.2, KDE Frameworks 5.27.0, and Qt 5.7.0 technologies, as well as the Mozilla Firefox 49.0.2 web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird 45.4.0 email and news client, which just landed in the stable Ubuntu repos on October 27, 2016. Talking of repos, Maui 2 comes with new software repositories. "We decided to move our repositories to a new infrastructure and cloned the Neon based repo so we have control over when to push new updates to the user and let the users themselves decide when they want to move to a new Plasma version or KDE Frameworks 5 version," reads the release announcement. Calamares universal installer now used by default That way, Maui users will always receive the latest stable KDE Plasma desktop environment, and guess what? Maui 2 switches to use the Calamares universal installer framework for GNU/Linux distributions as the default graphical installer for new Maui 2 installations. We remind you that Calamares 2.4 offers full-disk encryption support. Apart from bringing us the latest KDE Plasma 5 desktop experience and the Calamares installer, Maui 2 "Blue Tang" also reimplements the Driver Manager, an in-house built tool that promises to let you install the latest proprietary drivers for your hardware, including Nvidia, AMD or Intel graphics cards and Wireless chips. Ultimately, Maui 2 includes a new tool for configuring systemd services, replaces the GParted partition editor with KDE Partition Manager for a better disk partitioning experience, improves language translation support in the mintUpdate tool, enhances the KDE Telepathy Instant Messaging feature, and adds Inkscape and KDE Remote Desktop Client. You can download the Maui 2 64-bit live ISO image right now via our website, and if you're currently running the Maui 1 release on your personal computer, you can update to Maui 2 using the upgrade instructions provided by the development team on the project's official forums, where you'll also find all the help you need to get started with the Maui OS. #Maui 2#Maui Linux#Netrunner#Ubuntu 16.04 LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news HP Linux Imaging & Printing 3.16.10 Adds Support for Ubuntu 16.10 and Debian 8.6 Linux Kernel 4.8.5 Lands with Numerous CIFS, ARM64, and PowerPC Improvements Linux Mint 18.1 Slated to Launch Later This Year, Will Be Codenamed “Serena” Ubuntu 17.04 "Zesty Zapus" Now Tracks Linux Kernel 4.9, Could Ship Kernel 4.10 Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Maui 2 Linux Other Linux Distros LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Salix OS Xfce Live: A Live Linux distribution based on Slackware Linux and featuring the Xfce desktop environment Tails OS: An open source live Linux operating system focused on Internet privacy and anonymity 4MLinux Core: A core version of the 4MLinux operating system aimed for building your own distro NethServer: A beautifully engineered server oriented operating system based on the CentOS Linux technologies Black Lab Linux: An Ubuntu-based Linux operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment AUSTRUMI: A business card size bootable Linux distribution based on the Slackware operating system Reader comments Load old comments   Major Cryptsetup Vulnerability Affects Some LUKS-Encrypted GNU/Linux Systems more on: CVE-2016-4484 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that researchers with the Northwest Economic Research Center concluded that the state is nearing full employment levels and that Oregon’s recent economic growth can be expected to drop off in the coming years. Already some job sectors are slowing growth. Manufacturing, for example, has already slowed thanks to job cuts at Intel and other production companies. In the long run, the study found it is unclear what will sustain Oregon’s economy in coming years, but the economy is not faltering. The recovery period has just slowed in the wake of the recession.     Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? By Victoria Song October 28, 2016 12:58pm EST 10 Comments There's a shiny new MacBook Pro in town. But is it worth trading in last year's Pro or the MacBook Air? Another fall, another #AppleEvent, and another chance for the Cult of Apple to shake out their wallets and dive between the couch cushions to scrounge up the extra cash for a shiny new MacBook Pro. On the 25th anniversary of Apple unveiling its first laptop, Tim Cook took to the stage in Cupertino on Thursday to unveil a new MacBook Pro, which he said is the "thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever." That's par for the course at these events, though. The biggest announcement was the inclusion of the Touch Bar—a thin strip that replaces the function keys with multi-touch, app-specific gestures; it's a neat workaround for anyone put off by the idea of a touch-screen laptop. There's also a Touch ID power button on the MacBook Pro now, which will tap in to Apple Pay, of course. But are these additions a) what Apple fans really want, and b) a compelling enough reason to upgrade from your 13-inch MacBook Air or last year's MacBook Pro? Name Apple MacBook Pro 15-Inch (2016, Touch Bar) Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch, Retina Display (2015) Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (2015)   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $2399.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $1299.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $999.00 MSRP Editor Rating       Processor Name Intel Core i7-6820HQ Intel Core i5-5257U Intel Core i5-5250U Processor Speed 2.7 GHz 2.7 GHz 1.6 GHz Operating System Apple macOS Sierra Apple OS X El Capitan Apple OS X El Capitan RAM 16 GB 8 GB 4 GB Storage Capacity (as Tested) 512 GB 128 GB 128 GB Graphics Card AMD Radeon PRO 455 Intel Iris 6100 Intel HD Graphics 6000 Screen Size 15.6 inches 13.3 inches 13.3 inches Resolution 2880 x 1800 2560 x 1600 1440 x 900 Storage Type SSD, Flash storage Flash storage Flash storage Weight 3.99 lbs 3.48 lb 2.96 lbs   Read the Review Read the Review Read the Review If you're concerned about heft, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is 14.9mm thick, 17 percent thinner than last year's MacBook Pro, with 23 percent less volume. The 15-inch version comes in at 15.5mm thick, which is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than its predecessor. The new 13-inch is a mere 3 pounds—on par with the MacBook Air—while the 15-inch is 4 pounds. And while the Air is famous for its slim, tapered shape, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro still has it beat; it's 12 percent thinner and has 13 percent less volume than MacBook Air. The body is Apple's familiar sleek aluminum; get it in silver or space gray. The new MacBook Pro also sports a Retina display that's 67 percent brighter, has 67 percent more contrast ratio, and increases the color gamut by 25 percent. That translates to a 2,560-by-1,600 resolution on the 13-inch—the same as last year's Pro, but superior to the 1,920-by-1,080 resolution on the Air. The 15-inch comes in at 2,880-by-1,800 resolution. The keyboard also gets an update with second-generation butterfly switches, while the size of the Force Touch trackpad has been increased by 46 percent. At the risk of being called a gimmick, the Touch Bar was introduced as an "about time" update to the function keys. The Retina display technology replaces standard system functions, like brightness and volume control, and can adapt to whatever software you're currently using. So, if you're browsing in Safari, the Touch Bar will show you buttons for your favorite websites. If you're in Photos, you can straighten out your crooked photos with a swipe of a finger. When typing, it'll show you QuickType suggestions for frequently used words—much like an iPhone might. Professionally, Apple made an appeal to filmmakers, graphic artists, and musicians by demoing the Touch Bar's integration with popular programs like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop. But while the Touch Bar is new to the MacBook Pro, this isn't necessarily the first time we've seen something like it. The Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch also replaced the function keys with a similar touch strip called the Adaptive Function Row. Another more subtle update is the Touch ID power button. With the new MacBook Pro, you'll be able to login simply by pressing on the Power button. It features a second-generation sensor covered with sapphire crystal and is supported by the Apple T1 chip. Apple was quick to point out that this will make it easy to buy things through Apple Pay; if you share the MacBook Pro, you can switch between users with a tap of your finger. While Apple was keen to push these two updates as major reasons to upgrade, it's important to note that the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and Touch ID opt for four Thunderbolt 3 ports, a headphone jack, and...that's it. A 13-inch version without Touch Bar/Touch ID has two Thunderbolt ports. By comparison, last year's MacBook Pro came complete with an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SDXC card reader, and two USB 3.0 ports. The 13-inch MacBook Air comes with a headset jack, two microphones, a MagSafe 2 power jack, two USB 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 2 port, and an SDXC card reader. Anyone looking to upgrade should be comfortable buying a few extra dongles. The starting $1,799 configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID features a sixth-generation 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris Graphics 550, 8GB of memory, a 256GB PCIe-based solid-state drive, and up to 10 hours of battery life. While this is an improvement from the 2015 MacBook Pro, which had a fifth-generation Intel Core i5, and the Air, it's still not the most current seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor, a bit of a head scratcher considering the price. And even though we know it has a sixth-generation Intel chip, it's unclear what the exact Core i5 processor will be. At the end of the day, that's what it really comes down to. The 13-inch 2015 MacBook Pro started at $1,299, while the 13-inch Air starts at a neat $999. Does an extra $500-$800 for the Touch Bar, Touch ID, and four Thunderbolt ports merit an upgrade? (And don't forget to factor in those dongles!) For most people, probably not. Fans of ultraportability and port options can opt for another MacBook Air or stick with their current MacBook Pro. But if your MacBook is wheezing and on the verge of death, or you're super excited by Touch Bar and Touch ID, the new MacBook Pro might be the revolutionary high-end ultraportable of your dreams.

Baca / Journal Staff Writer Friday, October 28th, 2016 at 3:24pm The PNM Building is located at 414 Silver Avenue SW in downtown Albuquerque. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — The state’s largest utility saw net earnings drop more than 16 percent in the third quarter compared to the same time a year ago, driven in part by the recent rate case decision as well as decreased electric demand at Intel’s Rio Rancho plant. Public Service Company of New Mexico posted third-quarter net earnings at $40.9 million, compared to $49.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. PNM’s net earnings for the first nine months of the year dropped as well, from $80.6 million last year to $60.9 million this year. PNM Resources, the energy holding company that owns PNM and Texas-New Mexico Power Company, also saw net earnings decline, from $61 million in the third quarter last year to $54.4 million this year. Year-to-date earnings were $92 million, compared to $107.1 million last year. In a conference call with investors, President and CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said the earnings were in line with the company’s expectations, and focused primarily on the decision by state regulators to approve a customer rate hike below what the company requested. “The (PRC’s) determinations do not provide full recovery of all the investments we have made in our system,” said Vincent-Collawn. “We do not believe these determinations are consistent with either the law or the facts.” PNM has appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court. The company also plans to file a new rate case in December. Advertisement Continue reading The past case, one of the most contentious in recent memory, hinged on whether PNM acted “prudently” by purchasing $163.5 million worth of nuclear power from the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, extending several Palo Verde leases for $19.5 million per year, and installing $52.3 million worth of air pollution controls at San Juan Generating Station that other parties called excessive. The PRC eventually determined the company was entitled to an increase in annual revenue of $65.7 million, far less than the $123.5 million PNM requested. That decision wasn’t the only variable affecting PNM’s earnings. While investor materials show the company benefited from lower operations and maintenance costs, they also depict a company grappling with, among other things, decreased load from industrial customers. When asked by an investor what was driving the drop in industrial load, Chuck Eldred, PNM’s CFO, said it was mainly due to a single, large customer slowing its operations. Eldred said he had been asked not to name the company, but he went on to a describe a customer consistent with the profile of the Intel plant in Rio Rancho. Intel began laying off an unknown number of employees at the plant earlier this year, as part of a plan to reduce its global workforce by 11 percent. “We don’t have a strong industrial base in New Mexico to begin with, so that customer is really the driver (of PNM’s industrial load),” said Eldred. PNM reaffirmed its 2016 consolidated ongoing earnings guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share.

Photographs by Bloomberg and Mint Wipro Ltd, for now, is lagging behind Infosys Ltd in growth. Still, when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and investments in start-ups made by the two rivals over the last two years, Infosys Ltd’s boss Vishal Sikka may want to look at Wipro’s playbook, overseen by chief strategy officer Rishad Premji. Rishad Premji is the son of Wipro chairman Azim Premji, and reports to Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala. Over the last year, Infosys, surprisingly, has shied away from buyouts, despite spending $390 million to purchase three firms in the first year of Sikka’s tenure (see chart). Click here for enlarge Infosys is grappling with finding a stable management team to steer its M&A division. In July this year, Sikka asked Deepak Padaki to head the M&A team, just 18 months after Infosys reposed faith in Sikka’s former SAP colleague, Ritika Suri, to oversee the M&A division. Finally, the pace of investments in start-ups made by Infosys has slowed; the firm has made only two investments since January. Infosys has spent some $33 million (out of its $500 million fund to invest in start-ups) to buy stakes in eight start-ups and an undisclosed amount in Vertex Ventures, a Palo Alto-based venture capital firm. Seven of these investments were made in 2015. M&A is an important theme for Infosys as the management expects $1.5 billion in new revenue from buyouts as part of Sikka’s ambitious target of hitting $20 billion in revenue by March 2021. The three buyouts made by Infosys, for now, are estimated to bring less than $90 million in revenue. Wipro’s strategy is the most aggressive among home-grown IT firms, and can become a template for both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys, its bigger rivals, in how to better deploy cash and also invest in areas which can make outsourcing companies future-ready. Wipro, in the last 18 months (since April last year, when Neemuchwala joined the company as chief operating officer), has spent over $1.13 billion in making four buyouts which, in addition to making the firm future-ready, together bring in over $550 million in revenue. TCS boss N. Chandrasekaran has not made a single buyout or an investment in start-ups in the last two years. “Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date,” said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “They (Wipro) have been more deliberate whereas Accenture has been very aggressive, although the net results are the same. Wipro has got new service mixes and capabilities along with new clients. One aspect is the emphasis of taking company cultural considerations into play.” Wang said that it appears that “Infosys has slowed down M&As and venture activities”. Infosys maintains that it continues to evaluate firms and start-ups and there is no slowdown in decision-making. “I’m very focused that every business unit should not have more than one acquisition to integrate and digest,” Neemuchwala told Mint last week, explaining that M&As will bring in a “significant” share of revenue in Wipro’s ambition of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020. Wipro has spent over $22 million (of a $100 million fund) in picking minority stakes in seven start-ups and a venture fund. Sikka’s and Rishad Premji’s style of running their M&A and venture arms is also different, as none of Infosys’s executives, including Suri (who oversees Infosys Innovation Fund), have any experience in the venture capital space. In contrast, Wipro’s venture arm is run by Venu Pemmaraju, a former senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and company executive Biplab Adhya, who both report to Rishad Premji. One of the biggest benefits Wipro has accrued from its buyouts is that it has managed to retain the tag of India’s third largest software services firm, leaving HCL Technologies Ltd to be content at the fourth position. Wipro does not spell out the growth brought in from its four buyouts and the organic growth, but a senior executive conceded that the growth in core IT services has “considerably slowed down”. If Wipro manages to grow at the upper end of its 2% growth forecast in the fourth quarter, it will add $445.3 million in incremental revenue in calendar year 2016. The four buyouts are estimated to have accounted for at least $350 million in new business, translating to about 78% of all new business. HCL Technologies, which reported $6.23 billion in yearly revenue at the end of March 2016, will end with $7.04 billion in revenue at the end of March next year if it manages to grow at the management’s at-best 13% annual guidance. Wipro, which does not give annual growth guidance, is expected by analysts to report at-best 5.5% growth, translating to the company recording $7.75 billion in revenue at the end of the current financial year.

Focus  “It’s been said that leadership is making important but unpopular decisions. That’s certainly a partial truth, but I think it underscores the importance of focus. To be a good leader, you cannot major in minor things, and you must be less distracted than your competition. To get the few critical things done, you must develop incredible selective ignorance. Otherwise, the trivial will drown you.” —Tim Ferriss, bestselling author, host of The Tim Ferriss Show  Offer: Get The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss as a free audiobook with a 30-day free trial to Audiobooks.com. 2. Confidence “A leader instills confidence and ‘followership’ by having a clear vision, showing empathy and being a strong coach. As a female leader, to be recognized I feel I have to show up with swagger and assertiveness, yet always try to maintain my Southern upbringing, which underscores kindness and generosity. The two work well together in gaining respect.” —Barri Rafferty, CEO, Ketchum North America 3. Transparency “I’ve never bought into the concept of ‘wearing the mask.’ As a leader, the only way I know how to engender trust and buy-in from my team and with my colleagues is to be 100 percent authentically me—open, sometimes flawed, but always passionate about our work. It has allowed me the freedom to be fully present and consistent. They know what they’re getting at all times. No surprises.” —Keri Potts, senior director of public relations, ESPN 4. Integrity “Our employees are a direct reflection of the values we embody as leaders. If we’re playing from a reactive and obsolete playbook of needing to be right instead of doing what’s right, then we limit the full potential of our business and lose quality talent. If you focus on becoming authentic in all your interactions, that will rub off on your business and your culture, and the rest takes care of itself.” —Gunnar Lovelace, co-CEO and cofounder, Thrive Market 5. Inspiration “People always say I’m a self-made man. But there is no such thing. Leaders aren’t self-made; they are driven. I arrived in America with no money or any belongings besides my gym bag, but I can’t say I came with nothing: Others gave me great inspiration and fantastic advice, and I was fueled by my beliefs and an internal drive and passion. That’s why I’m always willing to  offer motivation—to friends or strangers on Reddit. I know the power of inspiration, and if someone can stand on my shoulders to achieve greatness, I’m more than willing to help them up.”  —Arnold Schwarzenegger, former governor of California Read This: Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger | Amazon | Indigo.ca | Barnes & Noble 6. Passion “You must love what you do. In order to be truly successful at something, you must obsess over it and let it consume you. No matter how successful your business might become, you are never satisfied and constantly push to do something bigger, better and greater. You lead by example not because you feel like it’s what you should do, but because it is your way of life.” —Joe Perez, cofounder, Tastemade 7. Innovation “In any system with finite resources and infinite expansion of population—like your business, or like all of humanity—innovation is essential for not only success  but also survival. The innovators are our leaders. You cannot separate the two. Whether it is by thought, technology or organization, innovation is our only hope to solve our challenges.” —Aubrey Marcus, founder, Onnit 8. Patience “Patience is really courage that’s meant to test your commitment to your cause. The path to great things is always tough, but the best leaders understand when to abandon the cause and when to stay the course. If your vision is bold enough, there will be hundreds of reasons why it ‘can’t be done’ and plenty of doubters. A lot of things have to come together—external markets, competition, financing, consumer demand and always a little luck—to pull off something big.” —Dan Brian, COO, WhipClip 9. Stoicism “It’s inevitable: We’re going to find ourselves in some real shit situations, whether they’re costly mistakes, unexpected failures or unscrupulous enemies. Stoicism is, at its core, accepting and anticipating this in advance, so that you don’t freak out, react emotionally and aggravate things further. Train our minds, consider the worst-case scenarios and regulate our unhelpful instinctual responses—that’s how we make sure shit situations don’t turn into fatal resolutions.”  —Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle is the Way and former director of marketing, American Apparel Offer: Get Growth Hacker Marketing by Ryan Holiday as a free audiobook with a 30-day free trial to Audiobooks.com 10. Wonkiness “Understanding the underlying numbers is the best thing I’ve done for my business. As we have a subscription-based service, the biggest impact on our bottom line was to decrease our churn rate. Being able to nudge that number from 6 percent to 4 Percent meant a 50 percent increase in the average customer’s lifetime value. We would not have known to focus on this metric without being able to accurately analyze our data.”  —Sol Orwell, cofounder, Examine.com 11. Authenticity “It’s true that imitation is one of the greatest forms of flattery, but not when it comes to leadership—and every great leader in my life, from Mike Tomlin to Olympic ski coach Scott Rawles, led from a place of authenticity. Learn from others, read autobiographies of your favorite leaders, pick up skills along the way... but never lose your authentic voice, opinions and, ultimately, how you make decisions.” —Jeremy Bloom, cofounder and CEO, Integrate Read This: Fueled By Failure: Using Detours and Defeats to Power Progress by Jeremy Bloom | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble 12. Open-mindedness “One of the biggest myths is that good business leaders are great visionaries with dogged determination to stick to their goals no matter what. It’s nonsense. The truth is, leaders need to keep an open mind while being flexible, and adjust if necessary. When in the startup phase of a company, planning is highly overrated and goals are not static. Your commitment should be to invest, develop and maintain great relationships.” —Daymond John, CEO, Shark Branding and FUBU Read This: The Power of Broke by Daymond John | Amazon | eBooks.com | Barnes & Noble 13. Decisiveness “In high school and college, to pick up extra cash I would often referee recreational basketball games. The mentor who taught me how to officiate gave his refs one important piece of advice that translates well into the professional world: ‘Make the call fast, make the call loud and don’t look back.’ In marginal situations, a decisively made wrong call will often lead to better long-term results and a stronger team than a wishy-washy decision that turns out to be right.” —Scott Hoffman, owner, Folio Literary Management 14. Personableness “We all provide something unique to this world, and we can all smell when someone isn’t being real. The more you focus on genuine connections with people, and look for ways to help them—rather than just focus on what they can do for you—the more likable and personable you become. This isn’t required to be a great leader, but it is to be a respected leader, which can make all the difference in your business.” —Lewis Howes, New York Times bestselling author of The School of Greatness 15. Empowerment “Many of my leadership philosophies were learned as an athlete. My most successful teams didn’t always have the most talent but did have teammates with the right combination of skills, strengths and a common trust in each other. To build an ‘overachieving’ team, you need to delegate responsibility and authority. Giving away responsibilities isn’t always easy. It can actually be harder to do than completing the task yourself, but with the right project selection and support, delegating can pay off in dividends. It is how you truly find people’s capabilities and get the most out of them.”  —Shannon Pappas, senior vice president, Beachbody LIVE 16. Positivity  “In order to achieve greatness, you must create a culture of optimism. There will be many ups and downs, but the prevalence of positivity will keep the company going. But be warned: This requires fearlessness. You have to truly believe in making the impossible possible.”  —Jason Harris, CEO, Mekanism 17. Generosity “My main goal has always been to offer the best of myself. We all grow—as a collective whole—when I’m able to build up others and help them grow as individuals.” —Christopher Perilli, CEO, Pixel Mobb 18. Persistence “A great leader once told me, ‘persistence beats resistance.’ And after working at Facebook, Intel and Microsoft and starting my own company, I’ve learned two major lessons: All great things take time, and you must persist no matter what. That’s what it takes to be a leader: willingness to go beyond where others will stop.”  —Noah Kagan, Chief Sumo, appsumo Read This: How I Lost 170 Million Dollars: My Time as #30 at Facebook by Noah Kagan 19. Insightfulness “It takes insight every day to be able to separate that which is really important from all the incoming fire. It’s like wisdom—it can be improved with time, if you’re paying attention, but it has to exist in your character. It’s inherent. When your insight is right, you look like a genius. And when your insight is wrong, you look like an idiot.” —Raj Bhakta, founder, WhistlePig Whiskey 20. Communication “If people aren’t aware of your expectations, and they fall short, it’s really your fault for not expressing it to them. The people I work with are in constant communication, probably to a fault. But communication is a balancing act. You might have a specific want or need, but it’s superimportant to treat work as a collaboration. We always want people to tell us their thoughts and ideas—that’s why we have all these very talented people working with us.” —Kim Kurlanchik Russen, partner, TAO Group 21. Accountability  “It’s a lot easier to assign blame than to hold yourself accountable. But if you want to know how to do it right, learn from financial expert Larry Robbins. He wrote a genuinely humble letter to his investors about his bad judgment that caused their investments to falter. He then opened up a new fund without management and performance fees—unheard of in the hedge fund world. This is character. This is accountability. It’s not only taking responsibility; it’s taking the next step to make it right.” —Sandra Carreon-John, senior vice president, M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment 22. Restlessness “It takes real leadership to find the strengths within each person on your team and then be willing to look outside to plug the gaps. It’s best to believe that your team alone does not have all the answers— because if you believe that, it usually means you’re not asking all the right questions.” —Nick Woolery, global director of marketing, Stance Socks Leadership Radicals & Visionaries Leadership Qualities Quotes Leadership Quotes Get the Magazine Limited-Time Offer: 1 Year Print + Digital Edition and 2 Gifts only $9.99 Subscribe Now Company Advertise Brand Licensing Contact Us Staff Contribute Upcoming Events On-Demand Event Products Business Books Reprints & Licensing Classifieds Entrepreneur Lending Entrepreneur Coaching Editions United States Middle East India Español Philippines South Africa China Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Flickr Tumblr RSS Feedly Subscribe Now Gift Subscriptions Subscriber Services Digital Editions iOSAndroidKindle Copyright © 2016 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

Thirteen-inch Pros include 8GB RAM while the faster and pricier fifteen-inch machines double that to to sixteen gigabytes. According to Apple, the new MacBook Pro cannot be configured with 32 gigabytes of RAM because doubling the memory would have a negative impact on battery life. MacRumors reader David emailed Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller asking about the RAM situation on the new MacBook Pro notebooks. “The lack of a 32GB build-to-order option for the new MacBook Pros raised some eyebrows and caused some concerns (me included),” reads David’s email. “Does ~3 GBps bandwidth to flash storage make this a moot issue? I.e. memory paging on a 16GB system is so fast that 32GB is not a significant improvement?”, he asked. Schiller responded that outfitting the new notebook with more than 16GB RAM would waste too much energy and have a negative impact on battery life. Here’s Schiller’s response in full: It is a good question. To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system. The new Pros use faster 2133 MHz memory. This shouldn’t concern the vast majority of notebook users because the 15-incher has plenty of RAM to run many apps without slowdowns. But if you’re going to be driving four external displays in 4K resolution via the new Pro to edit 4K and 6K footage and use the most resource-intensive apps, then I guess you might have a problem. What Apple should have done, I’d reckon, is permit power users to configure their MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM because those types of customers surely wouldn’t mind doubling the RAM at the expense of battery life. Also, if you’re going to edit high-resolution footage on this notebook you’re probably going to connect a desktop monitor to your Pro via USB-C, which also charges the notebook so battery life shouldn’t be something to worry about. I’m guessing Schiller forgot to mention that doubling the RAM would also make the CPU/GPU and the RAM chips become too hot to perform reliably. Intel’s Skylake chips and AMD’s dedicated Radeon GPU in the new Pro already require a whole new thermal architecture to keep components cool. In fact, the latest 15-inch MacBook Pro is rated with ten hours of wireless web use or iTunes movie playback, which is an hour improvement over the previous 15-incher. According to Apple’s webpage, the new MacBook Pro “continuously monitors system thermal and power conditions, and may adjust performance as needed to maintain optimal system operation” so there’s that. Does the RAM situation on the new MacBook Pro make sense to you? Source: MacRumors Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend MacBook Pro’s lack of 32GB RAM option could also be blamed on Intel’s Skylake chips Reviewers weigh in on the new MacBook Pro… 1Password now supports Touch ID and Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro Apple aggressively boosting MacBook Pro orders with 15M estimated shipments in 2016 Related Topics Apple, Mac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, News, RAM Pedro Remedios Buy the Mac Pro. Period. Problem solved. Deal with it! Mr Mop But the hardware in the Mac Pro is 3 years old asdf hackintosh george Shitty advice tipoo2 Buy a GCN 1.0 GPU computer for a few thousand dollars in 2016? Yeah, no. The combined performance of the two highest end GPUs in there has far been outstripped by cheaper single cards. Rejkelie That is not a solution for a couple of reasons. 1. Many people (especially in R&D) work in multiple locations and wants there main computer to be easily moveable. The garbage can isn’t. 2. The design of the MP is > 3 years old and the performance is not on pair with competition given the price. It was good then. Not now. 3. Longevity, the write off time in most companies is >= 3 years. Any MBP you buy today will most likely have to survive until ~2020. Having that capped to 16GB will make it a no go for many professional users. I’m sure the MBP will sell like water in Sahara to all people wanting to flash the L&G but for many us “professionals” this is unfortunately a complete showstopper at the moment and will make me keep my current MBP 15″ in the lab until te next spin of the HW comes out with more memory. Jess do you lack imagination, or just like to criticize others? there’s a million use cases that require a powerful laptop. and some of these even save lives.. Agneev Mukherjee Typo right there. The new Pros use faster 2,1333 MHz memory. It’s 2133MHz. Christian Zibreg Fixed, thanks YaBoyLilMayo Is It really that big of a deal? You still know wtf they mean bruh. This is the only website where people feel the need to become grammar nazis in the comments as if they get a prize or something for finding a tiny typo that doesn’t even effect the story….hold this L Agneev Mukherjee Yes, 2,1333 instead of 2133 is a big deal, ask a tech nazi and you’ll know. TechnoBuff Chris, your hyperbole is interesting “I’ve had a blast configuring the new MacBook Pro in Apple’s online store” The is only a max of 3 buttons to select from, there is not much to configure and you call that a BLAST!!!!! LOL You make the mundane sound so phenomenal ! Jibbley Gravey But it’s our choice? is it not? I’ll BEAT Tim Cook’s A** rockdude094 just get another laptop there are other brands other than apple you know Jibbley Gravey That run MacOS?????? lol no. No brand but APPLE. Still pushing with my Macbook Air. techfreak23 Hackintosh BRO Jibbley Gravey BRO …. we BOTH know HACKINTOSH is CRAP compared to the real deal… Trust me… before i had a Mac I attempted a hackintosh machine… JUST NO techfreak23 Meh it’s not that bad. I converted my old custom built pc into a Hackintosh and only had one issue that was very minor. Everything else worked PERFECTLY. Jess there’s Windows, or OS X. what else?? Andre Gironda The Mac Pro desktop (read: non-portable) is not something to lug around for digital forensics acquisitions. The MacBook Pro via macOS made it easy to engage a ramdisk. However, if a memory acquisition from another computer has 16G or more RAM, then it can’t be expanded in the MBP’s ramdisk space. The MBP is a flagship device for users wanting to plug into 4 4K or 2 5K monitors at the office desk while carrying to others’ cubes and into conference rooms for meetings. It doesn’t need 10 hours of battery life — it would be fine with 2-4 hours. The escape key isn’t that big of a deal — an external keyboard can provide that escape-key experience at the desk. However, the 16G of RAM is a huge deal — Engineers, Administrators, App developers, technology designers, and technology people of all types can use 32G of RAM — heck they can use 64G of RAM. With Docker containers (e.g., docker-machine), Cluster Operating Systems (e.g., Mesos DCOS), and workstation-style guest-OS virtualization (e.g., Vagrant, Parallels, Virtualbox, et al) — I don’t see how the MBP is relevant in an era where increasing RAM-space demands are scaling. What about CAD/CAM users who enjoy the roaming-cubes and conference-room roaming experience? What about deep learning prototypers? What about CG designers? Everyone can use more RAM! We want RAM, Apple, not excuses!! 5723alex . Buy a Surface Book i7. You can fit in 128GB of RAM, drive 8 4K monitors or 6 5K …. Chris Savage exactly Mr_Coldharbour How is 16GB of RAM not enough? Maybe for those who are running multiple virtual machines and web servers on that single MBP and apps that have been running for 2 days straight, 16GB is plenty good. Ricky Williams It’s not that 16GBs is not enough the problem is that it’s not an option. Some are more concerned with what they can’t get. There will be all these reasons why it’s needed no matter what other options are out there to fill the need. I’ve run my 2012 MBP with 16GBs of RAM since new and the RAM has never for me been the issue. I run multiple virtual machines with Linux and Windows without any issues. Like other posters have said there are other laptops out there, there is also the iMac and Mac Pro. Mr_Coldharbour Agreed. However as I stated I don’t think 32GB was ever an option on an Apple notebook, past or present. That’s why the iMac or Mac Pro (provided we see an update for those machines) are more compelling options. techfreak23 Apple no longer caters to professionals and hasn’t been for the last few years. This is an issue for those types of users. I myself have 16GB of RAM in my 2011 13″ MacBook Pro and I’m pretty consistently using anywhere between 10-14GB of RAM and I don’t even do any video, photo, or audio editing. I don’t think this is a problem for a majority of users, but definitely a pain in the ass for professionals. Mr_Coldharbour I do agree completely that shortly after the arrival of Tim Cook professionals have taken a back seat. Despite this, look at the PC market as a whole, who else besides Apple offers 16GB of RAM in a laptop as a standard baseline? No one else not even gaming PC manufacturers like Dell’s Alienware. Again, I do agree with what you said. All I’m saying is: (1) Apple computers still generally offer much more RAM in their computers in recent years. (2) Maybe the iMacs and Mac Pros will get updated and those go up to 64GB of RAM if not more, and that should be a solution. AquaVelva So get an iMac. When the MBP has NEVER had more than 16GB, what is your complaint? Professionals have other options in the mac lineup and if those are insufficient (as they apparently have been FOR YEARS), then get some other device. Jess You’re both missing the point. Just because MBP never had more than 16GB doesn’t mean it never should. Needs change, 4K and soon higher video standards (since this laptop can be expected to last many years) now require more RAM than in the past. If a professional or production studio is committed to OS X, there is literally no other choice for mobile professionals. We’re not talking about baseline RAM, other vendors offer 32GB as an option, why not Apple? The answer is simple actually – to force users to upgrade in 1-2 years time, when the 32GB option will be available. Apple has little real innovation left, it makes its money by withholding features and putting in incremental improvements that forces its user base to upgrade machines constantly to keep up and end up spending more than they otherwise would. JohnS I think you’re also missing something. Other vendors make computers for Windows to run on NOT MacOS. Take a look at the iPhone vs the Samsung for a second and watch the multitasking comparisons. Not all OSs are created equal and some require more memory than others. Case in point, I still use a MacBook Air with 8GB of memory and have quite comfortably recorded video on it, run virtualization software from it, edited movies, programed and had over 100 browser tabs open before simultaneously. While I’m sure it could be faster with more memory 8GB is actually going quite nice for me and one of my friends watching me work on it commented that he wished his old laptop was as fast as mine (and he has double the memory I do). Oh, and the external monitor I use with this is a 4K display too… Point is, at 8GB of RAM I’m seeing no reason to ditch this laptop. I’ll probably continue using it until it has a hardware failure at this rate. But if there’s anything I’m NOT concerned about it’s the max limit of 32GB of memory. MacOS has proven historically it’s very capably of doing a considerable about with a lot less. AquaVelva What an idiotic assessment you provided. Apple is at the forefront of many technologies. SoC, storage, displays, operating system and ecosystem are all untouchable. The fact that you’re too stupid to see Apples innovation is your fault. Jess How does it make sense to force someone who needed a laptop to suddenly buy a desktop, just because they needed the extra 16GB or RAM (many creative professionals, especially for 4K video editing)? Mobile and fixed desktop machines are totally different in terms of usability. JohnS Uhm… have you ever tried editing 4K video on an iPad? I ask because it’s silky smooth and only has 4GB of memory (which is 1/8th of the memory in the macBook Pro)… I edit video regularly on this MacBook Air with 8GB of memory and have 0 issues with it as well. I don’t buy your claim that anyone NEEDS more than 32GB of RAM in a laptop. Don Walker II How is 4GB 1/8th of 16GB? I think you mean 1/4th… JohnS Haha, my bad. Thanks for pointing that out. I was seeing 32GB mentioned so much here that I divided it into that 😛 My mistake! Don Walker II LeMerlot The missing RAM upgrade option is exactly the reason why I won’t buy the new MBP in its 1st version – that became clear for me after yesterday’s Apple presentation. I’ve always invested into the High End versions of the MBP in the last years – meaning in this new case an amount over 5.000 EUR (app. 5.500 USD) to spend as a German user. For this price tag the new MBP should be perfectly configurable for a Pro which it isn’t. So I’ll stay with my current MBR with already 16 GB RAM until the next MBP hardware version. kiboi Mac pro trash can also no upgrade this year. Smh AquaVelva Not sure how it’s missing if it was never there…. techfreak23 I think it’s time Apple… time to let Jony go… this whole obsession with making everything thinner because of every little jump in power efficiency is getting in the way of making better products with better battery life and keeping certain ports alive. NO ONE is asking for thinner devices. Cut the crap already. leart NO ONE is asking for thinner devices. Don’t be so much sure about that techfreak23 Please, tell me how shaving off 3mm and .5 a lb off of a laptop changes your life when you have to carry around that weight in adapters and dongles… or how shaving .2mm off the phones makes any difference whatsoever… TJ techfreak23 I agree, Im still amazed at how thin my mid 2015 MBP is, I think losing all those ports for a thinner design is ludicrous. JohnS IDK, 4 thunderbolt 3 ports is a major deal though… I’ll miss having at least 1 old USB port for the occasional times I need a thumb drive, but these days I do almost everything wirelessly anyways. One of the reasons I’m so excited though is that TB3 is crazy powerful. Enough so that you can now run desktop graphics cards to power external displays over them. Want the absolute latest desktop grade graphics for something? You can now. Want to plug in dozens of USB 3.0 devices into your laptop or really anything else? You can. The parallel data transfer and capabilities is unlike anything else out there. Personally this is one of the big pro features I’ve been holding out for to upgrade! So while I don’t have direct access to the old ports, knowing I’ve got so much more power now and can do things I’ve wanted to for a long time but haven’t been able to is well worth the trade for me. Plus if I’m honest I don’t use most of the ports unless I’m docked at my desk and in that case… I doesn’t effect me anyways. TJ I understand what your saying but not everyone lives in the “wireless world like we do. It’s like Apple just ripped of a huge bandage JohnS Yeah the biggest thing I think I’ll miss is the MagSafe 🙁 Fortunately though there are power to USB-C MagSafe like adapters on Amazon and elsewhere so I’ll probably just pick one of them up. I think the problem is that even if Apple said OK we’ll keep one USB 3.0 around for another year for compatibility sake. People would not only complain there isn’t enough USB 3.0 ports many wouldn’t bother to buy any adapters because why bother when you have the port right? At some point it had to happen and it was going to hurt. I think the big thing this time around is that all the change happened at once. White Michael Jackson Lmaoo Jess 3mm? that’s a lot, for a 15mm thick machine. I think most would have preferred an 8 mm or less thick machine. Basically, the thinner and lighter the better. 2lbs and less is noticeable. Let the techheads decide what the trade-offs are, but 95% of users want the thinnest machine possible. ideally, a foldable piece of power. step-by-step for sure, guess we’ll fight Apple every step of the way. Dongles not used all the time, just charge it up for the main show. For all-day use some modular set up is fine. 12 inch macbook pro is great, just a bigger version but not thicker, foldable screen to 15 and 17″ screen JohnS Interesting write up there! Here’s a few perspectives from another angle however if you’re interested. First of all I think selling computers without working to make them self serviceable isn’t that novel of a concept. Almost any other electronic that you get is a package. You buy a TV, stereo, VR headset, GPS, microwave, you name it; it’s a package. You buy it, enjoy the features it has and upgrade later when it breaks or a new model has a feature you decide you need. Why computers are the lone wolf here is a bit strange if you think about it. Most people don’t ever upgrade components on it anyways. If something breaks a year after getting it you replace it on warranty, several years after and now you’re left trying to figure out if it’s worth dumping hundreds in to upgrade the graphics when just a few more beyond that could get you a whole new setup with better specs across the board. Point is, I don’t think Apple is anti-hacker as much as trying to create products that “just work” (their words not mine) and when you look at everything else we buy it seems to make sense. Also, you mention apple dishing things out in steps. I don’t think this is really their choice. Like you said, if we buy a computer we can get up to 10 years out of it. Why does everyone seem to loose their mind and upgrade phones the day a new one comes out when there is nothing wrong with the old one then? Isn’t it really weird that people now have plans that let them actually upgrade 2x or more in a year so they can hop from flagship release to flagship release thought the year? I used my iPhone 2G for years and finally upgraded to the 4S and then to the 6+. But we as customers DEMAND that companies come out with products every 365 days. Along the way we compare them to other releases and complain that our phone is slipping behind and then when we get our release that was put together in less than 12 months we complain because its not the big jump that the original phones were that spent 6 years in development. Anyways, my point is I think that many of Apple’s decisions are based around the bizarre things we customers do. Would I like to see Apple maybe release a new phone every 2-3 years instead of every year? I actually think that might be more healthy and get us better features as they wouldn’t loose months and months every year working out manufacturing issues with the current tech. But they can’t, or people would riot in the streets that Apple is dead and has lost it’s ability to innovate etc. People that have to have something new every 6-12 months would switch and Apple would loose most of it’s customer base. Last thought is that an all in one device has a major issue. There’s a phrase out there that I think sums it up well. Jack of all trades, but a master of none. The problem is that the second you try to do everything on a single device you no longer do anything as well as if you specialized in that area. iOS specializes in bringing 100% of the apps and its OS to you in a finger friendly system, MacOS for a keyboard and mouse environment and TVOS for a remote controlled setup. The problem its that doing things on an all-in-one becomes incredibly difficult. You can’t get desktop level performance from a cellphone processor… So trying to attach peripherals to it will result in a sub par experience, an app might be optimized for touch but not for a remote so does it just give you a bad experience or does it vanish off your device when hooked up to a TV? The questions go on and on. Microsoft has chosen to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. Apple has tried to find some things that they can specialize in with the hope of doing each better than anyone else. It’s more expensive for consumers… but the experience is better too. All depends again on what the consumers are looking for. Considering Apple is the #1 seller of laptops, tablets, and phones I’d say that they are listening to their customers demands. LeMerlot I’d guess finally it’s just about cost savings by keepin’ the price high – which results in higher revenue per device. IMHO making everything thinner is just their marketing argument for justifying this move. JohnS Actually a lot of people want thinner and lighter devices (especially people who fly a lot and want to use them on airplanes). I myself got a MacBook Air simply because it was smaller and I knew I was going to be using it on the go a LOT. Every time I end up trying to hold my computer with one hand and type with the other I’m happy it’s small and light for that matter. So here is someone asking for thinner devices, please don’t assume to speak for me 😉 MacOS is also VERY good at managing memory. I run a web server on this MacBook Air, several development applications, video capture and editing software, virtualization tools, and more. Heck right now I have 92 tabs open across my 3 browsers (if I counted that right) and all of this on 8GB of RAM with next to 0 performance issues or lag. Could my computer be faster with more? Yup. But “true” professionals (like the good folks rending and creating movies for Pixar) are going to be using desktops not laptops for their work. Laptops sacrifice power for mobility and Apple is really doing a solid job I feel on this front. This new laptop is more capable than ever before and can handle 99% of “professional” workflows out there. But for the ones it can’t there are still desktop units. And quite honestly, if you’re doing work that requires that sort of hardware… you probably should be using a desktop anyways… Why should Apple try to make a laptop compete with a desktop when a laptop by nature does what a desktop can’t do? Be portable. Each should play to their strengths (desktops being powerhouses and laptops being highly mobile) or really what’s the point of having both? Why not just make a beast of a laptop and quit the desktop industry altogether? techfreak23 Yes, I get that SOME people want smaller devices, but that’s why they came out with the Airs and the 12″ MacBook. MacBook Pros are a different ballgame, hence the name PRO. I do work in an Apple retail environment, so I hear a lot of what customers want and expect out of their machine. Also get a lot of professionals in the video (maybe not Pixar level), music, and photography field going for the 15″ Pros because of what they use them for and because of the need to be portable. Of course, many of them also have desktops in addition to their laptops, but they need similar power when they are on the go. These are the types of customers that don’t appreciate changes like the ones made. My point wasn’t that they should compete with desktops because that’s what desktops are for. My point was that they are just making devices thinner for the sake of making them thinner at the expense of functionality. I, for one and many others like me, don’t like the new keyboard mechanism that came out with the new MacBook and now this latest refresh of Pros because they are almost too sensitive and don’t have the same tactile feel as before. I haven’t tried the new keyboards on Pros, but hopefully they don’t feel exactly the same as on the MacBook. Apple created their own engineering problem by wanting to make a wafer thin device and came up with the crappy keyboard. I know that’s a personal opinion, but I know I am not the only one who feels that way. The good thing that came out of that problem was the new way of laying out the battery to make the best use of the space. Now those that upgrade to the new Pros will have to live in adapter land for awhile or upgrade all of their equipment. I get that Apple is trying to push everyone into the future with TB3/USB-C because that’s where the market is going, but there has to be a transition period for everyone to catch up. Apple should have skipped making it thinner and left the SD reader (which a lot of photographers are angry that it’s been removed) and two USB-A ports. Once people have gotten more USB-C peripherals and caught up, THEN make the change. Google didn’t just come out with the Pixel with ONLY USB-C ports, they had two and two. The 13″ Pro doesn’t even have fully functioning TB3 ports on the right side, so why bother having the four ports instead of two USB-A ports. Your last paragraph there is exactly why Apple won’t come out with a tablet/laptop hybrid, but that doesn’t mean that a laptop shouldn’t encroach a little on the desktop space in terms of power. Why do you think the gaming laptop business is doing as well as it is? JohnS As someone who edits video periodically on a 8GB Ram 1.7GHz MacBook air I happen to know that you can in fact work quite nicely without needing “desktop specs”. In fact a few weekends ago, I was playing a video game, doing a Skype call and recording the screen without any lag or issues what-so-ever. The new MacPro’s are beasts compared to the laughable setup I have currently. That’s my point. I think that claiming this is a bad move because “the nebulous group out there known as professionals” aren’t getting enough specs is a bit odd. However you do raise some great points: I do agree with your comment about the keyboards. I also hope that the new keyboards are better than on the MacBooks! Oh, and since you work Apple retail feel free to let us know when they pull them out to show you 😉 I also agree that the laptops shouldn’t be made thin if it’s at the expense of features. The one area I do disagree on is that there is never a good time to remove a port from a user’s viewpoint. If this computer had kept the SD card reader so that people could have time to buy adapters we both know that no one would do it. You don’t buy an adapter so you can not use something, you buy it so that you can use something that won’t function without it. So if apple waited a year and then pulled it everyone would still be mad because no one would have bought an adapter unless the built in reader stopped working. Personally I’m bummed that they didn’t keep just one USB 3.0 port on there as SO much stuff still uses it. I can understand the technical reasons not to, but for sheer convenience sake I wish they would have. I also am going to miss the mag-safe charger too 🙁 Oh and as far as gaming computer sales, those are doing well, but they are in a league of their own with a purpose of their own. My gaming computer is a ASUS G75-VW and it is a massive beast that some airports want to charge me extra to fly with because it doesn’t fit the dimensions of a carry on :/ The thing is, I didn’t get it to be portable. I got it because going somewhere to game is significantly easier with it, then carrying my desktop and peripherals from location to location. I don’t know many people with gaming laptops that try to use them on the go. Almost everyone I’ve ever met with one of these beasts likes it because they can grab it and bring it to a friends house or LAN party or what not significantly easier than a full desktop setup. But it’s not used the same as a MacBook, the massive power consumption from custom cooling setups, overclocked GPUs and high end processors prevent them from being a true on the go computer (unless you only wanted to be away from an outlet for a few hours tops that is). YaBoyLilMayo No they don’t and shaving off 3mm isn’t gonna make anyone’s life any easier bruh just give up JohnS Actually it turns out that out of all laptops sold, 40% of them are considered ultrabooks. This means out of every 5 customers, 2 willingly gave up features of bulkier laptops in favor of laptops that shaved off some extra volume. Or put another way, over 120 million people would disagree with you enough to pay extra for thinness. Rejkelie For those who commented that you don’t need more than 16GB RAM. I work in R&D and I’m a heavy user of various mathematical modelling systems. One thing they all have in common is a need for memory. For me I wouldn’t have minded if they had to even increase the size of the 15″ MBP to get good enough thermal design to cater for, say, 128GB RAM. I don’t pesonally care about battery life as long is it more than ~4-5 hours to get me between airports. I just fail to see how battery life and “thiness” can be the most important driving forces in a professional targeted laptop, speed , memory and connections should be. Given that the write off time is around 3 years in most companies means that Apple implies that 16GB will be good enough until 2020 … ridiculous. I believe most professionals will wait for next years (or the year after that) spin of the HW which hopefully corrects this. AquaVelva “I don’t pesonally care about battery life as long is it more than ~4-5 hours to get me between airports” Obviously the MBP is not designed for people like you in mind who want to carry around a desktop in a laptop with 4 hours of battery life….and it NEVER WAS. mrgerbik WHY NOT? Felipe Queiroz Drumond What about the swap of memory between SSD and RAM? I’m not sure if MacOS manages the lack of memory like Windows does. If the PCI-e SSD is fast enough, the swap would help to diminish this issue. Anyway, I was really expecting 32GB memory option, specially because a MBP can last years and years and memory is very cheap nowadays. Charles222 Given that nothing I own has over 8GB and it all works perfectly fine, yah. therealjjohnson I hate how you guys have a mythical description of what “professional” is. I keep hearing that they are leaving out the “professionals” etc … yet people are still using these devices to do their work. Still editing movies, documentaries, recording music, photoshopping away etc. Who are the “professionals” that apple is now not focusing on? All I ever hear is some obscure reference of “what if they wanted to do this” scenario. Buy something else if you need something else. jennyzeroo A lot, well SOME, people actually need more than 16 GB of memory to do video editing and such. it’s extreme, BUT … ITS ….. A ….. PRO ……MODEL!!!!! so it SHOULD be an option if some PRO people NEED it. The battery power is the USUAL lame Apple excuse. You would save even MORE power with a limit of 8 GB of memory, but we don’t DO we. Stan I doubt that Apple can give a good explanation for not giving the option for 32GB RAM. Because there is none. The real reason is probably to leave some room for improvement for next year’s “upgrade”. Matt Musser i think the next gen cpu is not ready…so they think putting a fun bar on it will sell it. they need a 32g solution for pro developers and video graphic artists and musicians and people who dont close chrome windows and run multiple big ass monitors. thats me….. i am straining my 16G mb pro constantly so i had to get a mac pro with 24g….now i can work but want portability mike480 I don’t get why Windows computers that use skylake can get away with 32GB of RAM but the MBP can’t. Was so disappointed because I use Parallels to run 2 VM’s and I need the memory. Bacillus Schiller easily avoids the real story, about trade-offs they made because of their Intel partnership and Ive’s design authocracy. Whereas competitors have better, faster and more energy-sensible RAM architectures (yes, adding 1/2″ thickness) making Apple look pale. These guys now mainly live by their platitudes – just as elementary stupid as sad.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $30 off Sony PlayStation 4 Pro, $70 off Beats Solo3 headphones, and more Apple seeds watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3 to developers Beloved butt-looking peach emoji is back in iOS 10.2 beta 3, looks even more like a butt Jony Ive discusses 20 years of iconic Apple designs and that pricey new coffee table book Apple removed nearly 50,000 apps from App Store in October   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Defense Secretary of Ash Carter speaks to the Center for Strategic and International Studies about the force of the future in Washington, Oct. 28, 2016. DoD photo by Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Tim D. Godbee Carter Speaks Defense Secretary of Ash Carter speaks to the Center for Strategic and International Studies about the force of the future in Washington, Oct. 28, 2016. DoD photo by Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Tim D. Godbee Download Image Image details page He was speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ event, Assessing the Third Offset Strategy, a forum during which department leaders discussed the DoD drive to identify next-generation concepts and capabilities that will assure U.S. military superiority over the next several decades.  Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt chairs the DIB and its members include Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, United Technologies’ Mike McQuade and University of Texas Chancellor Bill McRaven, a retired Navy admiral and former commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.  “I’ve charged them and the rest of the board to help keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation -- to support innovators themselves, the people in our defense enterprise who are willing to try new things, fail fast and iterate, and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of our competitors,” Carter told the CSIS audience.  VIDEO | 01:33 | Carter Discusses Defense Department’s Challenges Trying New Things First, Carter said, the department will increase its focus on recruiting talented computer scientists and software engineers into the military and civilian. “We’ll do this through targeted recruiting initiatives ranging from our reserve officer training corps to our civilian scholarship-for-service program that’s intended to help build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders,” the secretary added, “all with the goal of making computer science a core competency of the department.” Second, he said, the department will invest more broadly in machine learning through targeted challenges and prize competitions, and through a virtual center of excellence model that establishes stretch goals and incentivizes academic and private-sector researchers to achieve them.  Chief Innovation Officer Third, Carter added, the department will create a DoD chief Innovation officer to act as a senior advisor to the defense secretary and serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, including for those suggested by the Defense Innovation Board and others.  These could include building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD at scale, sponsoring innovation contests and tournaments, and providing training and education that promotes new ideas and approaches to collaboration, creativity and critical thinking, Carter said.  VIDEO | 01:59 | Carter Cites Defense Innovation at Conference “Many different organizations have recently embraced this position also have started to regularly run these kinds of innovation tournaments and competitions – including tech companies like IBM, Intel and Google -- and it’s time we did as well,” he said, “to help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches and be recognized for them.” Going forward, Carter said he’s confident that the logic behind the range of innovations he’s introduced over the past year will be self-evident to future defense leadership. “But they also need to have the momentum and institutional foundation to keep going under their own steam and to continue to thrive,” the secretary said. “We must ensure they can keep leading the way and keep disrupting, challenging and inspiring all of us to change for the better.” Managing Talent On the process of innovating in managing talent among DoD civilians and the all-volunteer force, Carter said people are the source of every innovative thing the department has ever done, is doing or will do. “The good news is that there’s lots of opportunity here, as well as new techniques and technologies in talent management -- such as the kind of advanced data analytics that underpin companies like LinkedIn. But there are also challenges,” he said.  VIDEO | 03:48 | Carter Lays Groundwork for ‘Force of the Future’ The department’s human resources technology has limitations as generations and labor markets change, Carter added, “so even as our force of today is outstanding, we must ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer in future generations of defense.”  To build what the secretary calls the force of the future, he’s announced four links so far. These involve the following actions: -- Building and increasing on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions -- creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and more; -- Increasing retention among the ranks through increased support to military families by, for example, expanding maternity and paternity leave, extending childcare hours on bases, and giving families the possibility of geographic flexibility in return for added service commitments; -- Making common-sense improvements to military talent management, particularly for the officer corps, including giving military services the authority to do things like expand lateral entry for more specialties and adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance; and. -- For the DoD civilian force, making sure the department can directly hire civilian employees from college campuses, creating a new two-way civilian-talent-exchange program with the private sector, expanding the department’s scholarship-for-service program in mission-critical science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, and more. “When I talk about the force of the future,” Carter said, “I often say that there will be more to come and that’s still the case. So stay tuned because next week I’m going to announce the fifth and sixth links to the force of the future.” (Follow Cheryl Pellerin on Twitter @PellerinDoDNews)   Related Biographies Ash Carter carter Force of the Future SecDef News News Articles Posted 07/24/2015 Casualty Releases Posted 07/24/2015 Press Advisories Posted 07/24/2015 News Transcripts Posted 07/24/2015 Publications Posted 07/24/2015 Speeches Posted 07/24/2015 Contracts Posted 07/24/2015 Testimony Posted 07/24/2015 Messages Posted 07/24/2015 Special Reports Posted 07/24/2015 Secretary of Defense Biography Posted 07/24/2015 Speeches Posted 07/24/2015 Testimony Posted 07/24/2015 Photos Posted 07/24/2015 Deputy Secretary of Defense Biography Posted 07/24/2015 Speeches Posted 07/24/2015 Photos Posted 07/24/2015 Photos/Videos Photo Essays Posted 07/24/2015 Week in Photos Posted 07/24/2015 DoD Video News Posted 07/24/2015 Other Pentagon Press Badges Posted 07/24/2015 Press/Media Queries Posted 07/24/2015 Military Commissions Posted 07/24/2015 Other News Sources Posted 07/24/2015 Recent News Articles 11/15/2016 Pacom Chief: Indo-Asia-Pacific Region Remains ‘Most Consequential’ to U.S. 11/15/2016 Face of Defense: Army Officer Supports Fort Lee Community 11/15/2016 Counter-ISIL Strikes Target Terrorists in Syria, Iraq 11/14/2016 Chairman Expresses Confidence in Counter-ISIL Campaign 11/14/2016 DoD Initiative Crowdsources U.S. Military Competitive Advantage 11/14/2016 Carter: Ties to Tech, Innovation Communities Critical To DoD 11/14/2016 Uniformed Services University Seeks Candidates for New Graduate Programs 11/14/2016 Face of Defense: Olympian Transitions From Athlete to Soldier 11/14/2016 Inherent Resolve Strikes Target ISIL in Syria, Iraq 11/13/2016 Coalition Strikes Hit ISIL Terrorists in Syria, Iraq Quick Links Quick Links DoD Sites Contact Us DVIDS Available Jobs within DoD Privacy and Security Links Disclaimer Inspector General Recovery Act DoD Section 508 Join the Military Web Policy No FEAR Act Resources FOIA Site Map Plain Writing Act Limitations of Visual Information MILITARY SERVICES UNIFIED COMBATANT COMMANDS Stay Connected
TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB SSD review Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB SSD review By Matt Hanson Storage  Super-fast storage Shares 1. Features and performance 2. Verdict Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict One of the fastest SSDs you can buy today – but not quite the fastest. For Very fast PCI adaptor included No SATA bottleneck Range of sizes Against Expensive Not the fastest SSD out there Not suitable for all users Standard SATA III solid state drives (SSDs) already bring performance benefits over traditional hard drives, so when a drive comes along that promises 4.5x the speed of an SSD, as the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB does, you sit up and take notice. Unlike standard SSDs and modern HDDs that plug into the SATA III ports of your motherboard, the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB can plug into a PCIe or M.2 port of your motherboard. Most modern motherboards in desktop and laptop PCs will have these ports, so unless you’re using very antiquated hardware, you should be able to install the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB without a problem. The SATA III ports of a motherboard were really designed for traditional hard drives, so although SSDs bring performance increases, their performance is being bottlenecked by the connection – and this is why most modern SSDs peak at around 520MB/s write, 560MB/s read, speeds. To put this in perspective, the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB, which avoids the SATA ports, can get up to speeds of 2,600MB/s read, 1,600 MB/s write. That’s a huge difference. This does mean you’re going to be paying more cash for this performance. The Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB costs £315 (around $385, AU$500), which is around the same price as the Kingston 1TB SSDNow KC400, which costs £320 (around $400, AU$520). Similar price, but half the capacity. However, it’s all about speed, and that means over three times the speed for sequential write tasks, and over five times the speed for sequential read tasks. Put simply, this is an SSD for enthusiasts that place speed over anything else. If you’re looking for a large capacity hard drive to store photos or slap into a NAS, then this is not the drive for you.  Features and specification The Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB uses the M.2 interface on your motherboard which bypasses the aging SATA III ports that most standard SSDs and HDDs use.  If you don’t have a motherboard with an M.2 connection (though most modern ones should), the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB also comes with a PCI-E adaptor, for slotting in the drive there.  The NVMe interface further helps speeds by reducing latency in the I/O path between the drive and the CPU of your machine, making this a potentially very fast drive. When active the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB has a power consumption of 6.0w, which means this is a pretty efficient SSD, and endurance-wise it has a service life of 296TB total bytes written (with the 1TB model having 592TB TBW). A mean time between failures of 1.5 million hours, and SMART support gives us confidence that this is a reliable SSD that can be used every day for intensive tasks. Performance  To make sure we tested the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB to its full ability we installed it in the M.2 port of a Maximus VIII Extreme Intel Z170 motherboard with the latest UEFI BIOS installed, Windows 10, and the Intel NVMe driver.  We ran a number of benchmarks on the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB to see how it coped under pressure. The results were very impressive, with the drive hitting speeds of 2606MB/s read and 1444MB/s write in our sequential tests using the CrystalDiskMark.  These are incredibly fast speeds when you compare it to modern SATA III SSDs such as the Kingston 1TB SSDNow KC400, which hit 560.8MB/s read and 536.6MB/s write speeds. A fairer comparison would be to the Samsung NVMe SSD 960 Pro M.2, which uses the same M.2 connection.  Here the Samsung beat the Toshiba OCZ, reaching phenomenal speeds of 3480MB/s read, 2100MB/s write – quite a difference, though the Samsung is more expensive ($329.99, £270, AU$430 for the 512GB version).  Still, the Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB represents a huge performance leap over SATA III drives, though if you’re spending this much already on an M.2 drive, you may think the extra outlay for the faster Samsung is worth it. The ATTO benchmark, which is a reliable tool for testing the read and write speeds of a hard drive using various file sizes, also provided some very impressive results, with top speeds of 2670MB/s read and 1600MB/s write speeds.  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Matt Hanson How to editor Matt (Twitter) is TechRadar's How To editor.

The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that researchers with the Northwest Economic Research Center concluded that the state is nearing full employment levels and that Oregon's recent economic growth can be expected to drop off in the coming years. Already some job sectors are slowing growth. Manufacturing, for example, has already slowed thanks to job cuts at Intel and other production companies. In the long run, the study found it is unclear what will sustain Oregon's economy in coming years, but the economy is not faltering. The recovery period has just slowed in the wake of the recession. ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Related Articles AN F.A.Q.

By Eileen Brown for Social Business | October 28, 2016 -- 14:01 GMT (07:01 PDT) | Topic: Social Enterprise Social intelligence company Brandwatch has released its social outlook report. It looked at 15 different industries and watched the social interaction of 450 brands. Brandwatch It wanted to find out which brands have the strongest online presence. It looked at over 115 million social conversations recording data across different channels. Special Feaure The Industry Cloud: Why It's Next Coud computing has engulfed lots of IT, but one of the untapped regions of the tech and business world is the industry cloud, focusing on vertical industries and more specialized applications. Read More It measured social visibility -- how strong the brand's presence is across social media. It also looked at presence across non-social channels, tone or mood, audience reach, engagement, and content. Organizations were ranked according to their following on Twitter and Facebook. Likes, @mentions, replies, comments, page shares, and page likes were analyzed. Across all industries, brand owned accounts accounted for only 4.2 percent of the conversation around the brand. Brand audiences accounted for the remaining 95.8 percent of conversation. Airlines accounted for almost 20 percent of the conversation, whereas luxury fashion brands comprised 3 percent. The retail industry itself held the number five position out of all the industries it analyzed. The report noted that companies need to understand where and how customers make their purchasing decisions to stay in tune with their customers. Online retailers are prevailing when it comes to social savvy. Amazon, with a retail social visibility score of 77 and eBay (69) respectively hold the top two spots. The report showed that about 80 percent of consumers research products online before purchasing in store. Conversely, the report noted that 41 percent of consumers look at products in store, and then purchased the products online. Across the tech industry, the brand with the highest social visibility score is Lenovo with a score of 100. This is followed by Intel (73) and Samsung (69). Nintendo (social visibility score of 52), and Microsoft (49) also appeared in the top five brands in terms of online conversations. Brandwatch Most technology consumers use words like cool and innovative when mentioning the brand. Tellingly, the word 'affordable' is bottom of audience mentions. Response times need to be fast if the industry is to socially thrive. Six industries responded within five hours. However consumer tech and healthcare took over 15 hours to respond to customer comments. The report showed "numerous" organizations across almost every industry who failed to respond to a single audience @mention across the three months analyzed. Sadly, in these enlightened days some companies still do not get, nor more importantly, value social. Fortunately the consumer has many other brands where they can spend their online dollars.

The dress illusion found viewers dividing into it’s-blue-and-black and it’s-white-and-gold teams, and then arguing about the colors of a dress photo for days. This new shiny legs optical illusion won’t have the same, er, legs, because the photographer has already spilled the beans, or rather the paint, according to Insider. Hunter Culverhouse posted a photo of legs on Instagram. Right off some of her followers were convinced the legs were oiled up, covered with gloss, or had some other substance to make them shiny. Others never saw shininess but instead knew immediately what was really going on. Related: Is this dress white and gold or black and blue? The experts have an answer According to Insider, the shiny-looking-legs shot wasn’t intentional but was meant to show what they’d done after working on a project for art class. Culverhouse emailed Insider, “I had some white paint left on my brush and put random lines on my legs, [and it] turned out to be a completely confusing picture for everyone on the internet. The first time I posted it, it didn’t go completely crazy,” Culverhouse wrote in an email. “But then I reposted it again and other big accounts started to post it and share it. Then it took to Twitter and YouTubers started tweeting about it as well.” So it turns out the legs aren’t shiny at all, but streaked with white paint. After the “shiny legs” photo went viral it gained attention outside Instagram and took off on Twitter. Optical illusions attract attention, most often just for fun. Even once we figure out what’s really in the image our minds seem to pause while we try to “click” the image back and forth to see it both ways. And it’s not just an internet trick — earlier this year painted optical illusion road blocks were used to slow traffic near school zones in India.

The screen really pops, with less bezel and wider color range. Adding space grey as a color option gives it a bold, mod look. The Bad This version leaves out the amazing new Touch Bar. It's more expensive than the model it replaces and has only a pair of USB-C ports plus a headphone jack for wired connectivity. The shallow keyboard takes getting used to. The Bottom Line While it's missing the buzzworthy Touch Bar, the entry-level MacBook Pro is effectively the redesigned and updated 'Retina MacBook Air' that you've been waiting for. Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016) Meet the new mainstream MacBook. Because the MacBook Air is now living in a form of suspended animation, still on sale, but lacking updated components or a tweaked design, it's no longer the default mainstream choice. And the tiny 12-inch MacBook is a niche speciality system for frequent travelers who favor portability over flexibility. The new MacBook Pro with Apple's inventive Touch Bar and Touch ID fingerprint recognition is too expensive to be the go-to MacBook. Yes, the Touch Bar is impressive -- it's a 60-pixel-high OLED touch screen that replaces the traditional function key row with an ever-changing series of buttons and sliders. But right now I'd call it a want, not a need. View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET Instead, this most mainstream of the new MacBook Pro models has the same familiar Function key row found on almost every laptop. It sits above the keyboard, with its F1 to F12 keys still labeled for screen brightness, volume controls and other system tasks. It's a disappointment to miss out on the most headline-grabbing feature of the new MacBook Pro line, but with that one exception, nearly everything else about this system is new. A new keyboard with shallower keys, modeled after the nearly flat keyboard on the 12-inch MacBook, joins a larger touch pad and a pair of USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. Lost in the shuffle is the traditional port collection of a MagSafe power plug, USB-A ports -- the familiar rectangular ones that match all your existing accessories -- HDMI output and mini-DisplayPort Thunderbolt connections. The old SD card slot is gone, too. More from Apple's Mac event The new Apple MacBook Pro: Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Jonny Ive talks about putting 'touch' on the MacBook Pro Does the Mac still matter? The Mac and iPad aren't merging. Get over it See all our Apple event coverage Excising those ports and slimming down the keyboard means the new MacBook Pro has a body that's a few millimeters thinner and about half a pound lighter than the previous MacBook Pro. The new design takes the MacBook Pro down to 14.9mm thick from 18mm and the weight down to three pounds (1.36kg). But it's still far from the thinnest laptop out there. HP's Spectre and Acer's Swift 7, both powered by even newer Intel Core i7 seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors, are both less than 10mm thick. Meanwhile, the classic MacBook Air, once the king of the thin laptops, is still 17mm. View full gallery A MacBook Air next to the new MacBook Pro. Josh Miller/CNET While you're saving some money by foregoing the Touch Bar, this is still more expensive than the MacBook Pro it replaces. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina display was previously $1,299. This new 13-inch Pro starts at $1,499, £1,449 and AU$2,199 and includes an updated Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid state drive. There are other compromises besides just the loss of the Touch Bar in this entry-level MacBook Pro. The starting CPU, part of Intel's sixth-gen of Core i-series chips, is slower than in the $1,799 version. There are only two USB-C ports that need to handle all of your connection needs, including power, data and video output, while the higher-end MacBook Pros get four USB-C ports. But, unlike the new iPhone 7, the headphone jack survives. For now. View full gallery This new Force Touch track pad is twice the size of the previous version. Josh Miller/CNET No Touch Bar, but a bigger touchpad It's not as cool as the Touch Bar on the higher-end Macbook Pro models, but there is one big touch-related upgrade here. The touchpad, which uses Apple's Force Touch technology, is twice as big as before. It looks and feels massive, completely dominating the front half of the system interior. Like the touch pads (Apple prefers to call them "trackpads") found in the previous-generation MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook, this one has four corner sensors under the glass pad rather than the more traditional top-mounted hinge. The mechanism takes up less space, so the laptop body can be thinner. It's now in every laptop Apple makes, with the exception of the MacBook Air. A keyboard with less click One of the things people had a hard time getting used to in the 12-inch MacBook back in 2015 was its very flat keyboard. It used a butterfly mechanism, which allows for shallower keys and a thinner body. The same basic design has made its way to the new MacBook Pros, and it's going to be a learning curve for most. View full gallery Josh Miller/CNET The advantage is that you can have a slimmer body, but you lose out on some of the deep, clicky physical feedback of the current MacBooks or most other modern laptops. While the basics are the same, as is the key travel (an industry term for the distance the key moves downward to register an input) as on the 12-inch MacBook, the feel has been tweaked a bit for a better overall experience. The keys have a little more bite to them, and appear to rise up from the keyboard tray just a hair more.

Windows 10 Creators Update is aptly named, packed with tools to create and share just about anything. Included in the Creators update are: Paint 3D, an update on the classic drawing app that adds 3-D functionality Remix3D.com, an online community where you can share art from Paint3D, Minecraft and more and 3-D print your creations through the site (Windows Insiders can sign up to test these features starting today.) 3-D support in Word, Excel and PowerPoint Built-in game broadcasting with Beam livestreaming software Easy sharing with your contacts (put contacts right on your task bar, then drag and drop files to send) While Microsoft is working on its own virtual reality headset, the HoloLens, the company is also partnering with Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo to create budget-friendly VR headsets. Starting at $299, they'll be much more affordable than PC VR headsets like the Oculus Rift ($599) or the HTC Vive ($799). There's no word yet when these new headsets will be available, but the Windows 10 Creators Update will be out in early 2017, free for Windows 10 owners. Microsoft is also launching an updated hardware lineup, including a more powerful Surface Book with 16 hours of battery life and twice the graphics performance of the current model. Also new are an all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio, and an input device called the Surface Dial. The Surface Studio is an all-in-one PC that's clearly taken some inspiration from tablets. The system's 28-inch, 4.5K-resolution touchscreen display offers impressive, true-to-life color. It provides a sharper picture than a 4K TV and delivers more color than 99 percent of the world's computer monitors. A hinge lets you swing the screen down to a 20-degree angle to use more like a tablet, perfect for drawing with the Surface Pen. The Studio will be a powerhouse PC available with Intel i5 or i7 processors, an NVIDIA GeForce GPU with up to 4GB of memory and 32GB of memory for the system itself. Starting at $2,999, it's system designed for graphics professionals who need top-tier performance. The Surface Studio is available for preorder now and ships in December 2016. Microsoft says it will be available in limited quantities for the holidays, with broader availability starting early next year.     As the name implies, the Surface Dial looks like a physical dial. It connects to your Surface via Bluetooth to let you easily navigate menus, but it seems best suited to use with the Surface Studio. When placed on the screen of the Studio, it brings up menus or tools specific to the app you're using. If you preorder a Surface Studio before Dec. 1, you'll get a Dial for free; otherwise, the Dial costs $99 and ships Nov. 10.

Microsoft and Apple revealed new laptops within 24 hours of each other - but which one comes out on top  Share  Comments ByJeff Parsons 12:38, 31 OCT 2016 Updated12:38, 31 OCT 2016 Technology (Photo: Getty Images)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Apple and Microsoft have been rivals for the last three decades. And this week both companies revealed new flagship laptops with the hope of tempting you away from your cash. In Microsoft's corner is the Surface Book i7, a pumped up version of last year's flexible laptop with the funny hinge . Representing Apple is the latest version of the MacBook Pro , compete with the "Touch Bar" input above the keyboard. Both companies are gunning for your hard earned cash - and you can expect to part with a lot of it for either machine. But which is the best to choose? We've broken down the differences on several key points below, so you can see how the two machines stack up next to each other.

It's still got the matte grey colour scheme and the funky "dynamic fulcrum" hinge that Microsoft is so proud of. It's a spring-like mechanism that folds into itself when you close the laptop, leaving a noticable gap between keyboard and screen. Importantly, the screen can be completely detached from the keyboard, leaving you with a 13.5-inch tablet to use - something the MacBook Pro can't offer. Read More Apple quietly hikes UK price of ALL Mac computers by around 20% in wake of Brexit vote Microsoft Corporate VP of Devices Panos Panay, talks about Microsoft Surface Book i7 (Photo: Getty Images) Apple meanwhile has slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro considerably for the 2016 model. It's also added the new Touch Bar above the keyboard which adapts the controls it shows depending on the application a user is currently working in. For example, favourites and bookmarks appear when the Safari browser is opened, and editing tools when viewing photos. The Touch Bar can also suggest words when you're typing out messages, and flash up emoji suggestions. Read More MacBook Pro 2016 hands-on review: An amazing machine with an eye-watering price Apple has added a Touch Bar to the new MacBook Pro When it comes to sizing, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch screen sizes while the Surface Book i7 sticks to 13.3-inches. The Surface Book's resolution is 3,000 x 2,000 pixels whilst the MacBook Pro's is 2,560 x 1,600. Price Pricing for both the MacBook and the Surface is (to put it mildly) a bit high. Apple's new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and Touch ID cost £1,749 and £2,349 respectively . Read More Apple reveals UK price of new MacBook Pro - featuring TouchID and 'Touch Bar' for navigation The Surface Book Microsoft's i7 Surface Book starts out at £1,799 with a 256GB SSD hard drive and goes up to £2,649 for the 1TB version. Microsoft edges out Apple when it comes to pricing - so if you're looking to save fifty quid then the MacBook Pro is the one to go for. Specs and battery life In technological terms, both Microsoft and Apple have thrown the kitchen sink at these computers. Both use Intel's latest 6th generation processors with both an i7 and i5 option available. Both use SSD drives and dedicated graphics chips for video rendering and gaming. In fact, they're so similar that it's hard to say exactly which one would come out on top in a straight performance battle. Read More Windows 10 Creators Update: Release date, price and key features of Microsoft's next operating system update Phil Schiller discussing the MacBook Pro display Microsoft may just have the advantage when it comes to battery life though. The Surface Book i7 is quoted as having up to 16 hours of battery life while Apple only promises 10 hours of battery from the MacBook Pro . Conclusion When you look at the two devices on paper, then Microsoft appears to have edged it out with the superior battery life and a more detailed screen. But a choice between the two also comes down to software and, of course, your other devices. If you're an iPhone user with a big library of iTunes songs then it makes sense for you to go for the MacBook Pro . Read More Microsoft unveils Surface Studio FOLDING desktop PC with wafer-thin touchscreen and a giant hinge Similarly, if you've built up a back catalogue of Windows programs and want a machine that'll double as a tablet, it's a clear win for the Surface. And, as ever, these are only observations at the moment. We'll have to wait until the two machines actually make their way into the hands of paying customers to see which company comes out on top. poll loading Which laptop is better? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Microsoft Surface Book Apple MacBook Pro Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Microsoft Apple MacBook Pro Microsoft Surface tech all Most Read Most Recent NintendoNintendo Mini NES Classic Edition: Release date, price, games and how to pre-order Mario's nostalgic new console Nintendo is going back to the glory days with this brand new version of the classic NES console - here's everything you need to know about it TechnologyWhatsApp finally launches the feature EVERYONE wants - and it has consequences for Facebook, Google and Apple Video calling has finally been made available on the platform, putting it into competition with Messenger, Duo and FaceTime iPhone rumoursiPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple has only just launched its iPhone 7, but many eyes are already turning to next year's model, the iPhone 8, which is expected to be Apple's biggest launch in years TechnologyThis simple trick will let you screenshot a Snapchat message without notifying the sender If you want to screenshot a Snapchat message without the sender knowing, all you need is this simple trick NintendoNintendo Classic Mini NES sells out in days as gamers rush to buy cheap and cheerful retro console Dodgy Amazon sellers have been jacking up the prices to try and cash in on demand Video GamesSuper Mario Run: release date and price confirmed for new mobile game Nintendo have revealed the release date and price for the full Super Mario Run mobile game.

By Eileen Brown for Social Business | October 28, 2016 -- 14:01 GMT (07:01 PDT) | Topic: Social Enterprise Social intelligence company Brandwatch has released its social outlook report. It looked at 15 different industries and watched the social interaction of 450 brands. Brandwatch It wanted to find out which brands have the strongest online presence. It looked at over 115 million social conversations recording data across different channels. Special Feaure The Industry Cloud: Why It's Next Coud computing has engulfed lots of IT, but one of the untapped regions of the tech and business world is the industry cloud, focusing on vertical industries and more specialized applications. Read More It measured social visibility -- how strong the brand's presence is across social media. It also looked at presence across non-social channels, tone or mood, audience reach, engagement, and content. Organizations were ranked according to their following on Twitter and Facebook. Likes, @mentions, replies, comments, page shares, and page likes were analyzed. Across all industries, brand owned accounts accounted for only 4.2 percent of the conversation around the brand. Brand audiences accounted for the remaining 95.8 percent of conversation. Airlines accounted for almost 20 percent of the conversation, whereas luxury fashion brands comprised 3 percent. The retail industry itself held the number five position out of all the industries it analyzed. The report noted that companies need to understand where and how customers make their purchasing decisions to stay in tune with their customers. Online retailers are prevailing when it comes to social savvy. Amazon, with a retail social visibility score of 77 and eBay (69) respectively hold the top two spots. The report showed that about 80 percent of consumers research products online before purchasing in store. Conversely, the report noted that 41 percent of consumers look at products in store, and then purchased the products online. Across the tech industry, the brand with the highest social visibility score is Lenovo with a score of 100. This is followed by Intel (73) and Samsung (69). Nintendo (social visibility score of 52), and Microsoft (49) also appeared in the top five brands in terms of online conversations. Brandwatch Most technology consumers use words like cool and innovative when mentioning the brand. Tellingly, the word 'affordable' is bottom of audience mentions. Response times need to be fast if the industry is to socially thrive. Six industries responded within five hours. However consumer tech and healthcare took over 15 hours to respond to customer comments. The report showed "numerous" organizations across almost every industry who failed to respond to a single audience @mention across the three months analyzed. Sadly, in these enlightened days some companies still do not get, nor more importantly, value social. Fortunately the consumer has many other brands where they can spend their online dollars.

This version of Apple’s new, revamped MacBook Pro line does not include the heavily touted Touch Bar, that feature is reserved for the company’s two higher-end models. The build If you were hoping for a reimagining of the laptop akin to Microsoft’s Surface line, Apple’s 13-inch Pro is not for you. The new MacBook Pro features an aluminum body that’s very similar to the one that encased the previous MacBook Pro, though it’s 17 percent lighter and features 23 percent less volume than the previous generation of the Pro. It comes in at 1.3kg (about 3lb), approximately half a pound lighter than the older 13-inch Pro. In fact, if you were to compare the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the 13-inch MacBook Air, the new version is 12 percent thinner — though it doesn’t feature the same slanted body — and it’s also the same exact weight. The laptop is now available in two finishes as well: Silver and Space Grey, which was dropped from the iPhone line with the 7 and 7 Plus. Stunning display Apple likes to tout its intricate design process with wordy acronyms and sometimes abstract concepts, and that hasn’t changed with the 13-inch Pro. In fact, it’s progressed to a new level, with the company claiming the Pro’s display features “oxide TFT” technology that allows it to be 30 percent more power efficient than the screen in the previous generation of devices. I have no idea what oxide TFT is or what it does to make the Pro’s screen look better, but what I do know is that I’m impressed with what I’ve seen of the display so far. All technical jargon aside, the Pro’s screen looks great, likely because the company says it’s 67 percent brighter than the previous MacBook Pro screen, allowing you to see more detail in bright ambient light conditions. I’ve spent time browsing the internet, watching Netflix and even edited a few photos with the laptop’s 2560 x 1600 pixel display. Keyboard and Trackpad upgrades Similar to the Touch Bar featured in its high-end siblings, the low-end Pro features the Butterfly keyboard mechanism pulled from the 12-inch MacBook. While some hate this revamped keyboard, I’m fond of it and find it not only allows me to type faster but more accurately as well, especially when compared to the old school Pro and Air typeface. After spending about 20 minutes typing on the Pro’s new keyboard, including while writing up this hands-on, I started to notice that the keys actually feel slightly more responsive than the ones present in the Pro’s smaller, 12-inch brother. I’m not sure why exactly, but they do. The standard function keys present in older versions of Apple’s laptops but absent from the new Touch Bar wielding devices, also makes a return in this lower-end iteration. Here’s where things get worthwhile, though; apart from an obvious subtle aesthetic shift to a flat, no longer slopped body, the new MacBook Pro’s absolutely massive trackpad is a welcome change. Multi-Touch gestures are easier to input thanks to the trackPad’s 46 percent larger size. I’ve always found Apple’s trackpads to be the differentiating factor in the laptop market. Despite how much I like Microsoft’s Surface Book and to a lesser extent, the Surface, neither device’s trackpad feels as fluid as Apple’s technology, especially when the new Pro is taken into consideration. I’m less fond of the shift towards Force Touch and away from a physical click, but similar to the 12-inch MacBook, I’ll likely get used to it. It’s also worth noting that the virtual Force Touch “click” in the Pro actually feels more satisfying than the tech did with the 12-inch MacBook. Under the hood Apple has made some lofty claims about the 13-inch Pro regarding its hardware prowess, stating that its Core i7 Skylake architecture and integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540 card are significantly more powerful than the tech featured in its predecessor. Some expected more of a technical leap with Apple’s new Pros that included Intel’s new Kaby Lake architecture as well as an independent graphics card on the lower-end version, especially considering their hefty price tag, but unfortunately that is not the case. All in, Apple claims that the new 13-inch MacBook is 80 percent faster than the previous generation of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. While this is likely true, I haven’t had enough time to push the computer yet. On paper, however, the new Pro is certainly impressive, with the laptop sporting 8GB of RAM, Intel Core i5 processor and a 256GB SSD drive. Where things start to get murky is when the laptops Thunderbolt 3 (which are just USB-C ports) are taken into consideration. Yes, USB-C makes life difficult right now, but there is no doubt that it is the future of connectivity. Would it have been great if Apple included USB-C and standard USB-A ports in the Pro? Definitely, but that also would result in the laptop being slightly thicker. Like it or not the #donglelife is here to stay, at least in this awkward transition period between port technology. The 13-inch Pro features two USB-C ports that can be used for charging, instead of the four featured in its 13-inch and 15-inch with Touch Bar compatriots. While I’ve defended the decision to opt for USB-C in these new laptops, what’s impossible to argue is how easy it would have been for Apple to include a free adapter that allows older USB-A to be plugged into the laptop. Apple definitely heard the vocal complaints from 12-inch MacBook owners but opted not to listen when it comes to this refresh. High price tag The 13-inch Pro’s price tag is unfortunately astronomical, especially in Canada, coming in at $1,899 to the shock of many of us living north of the border. The price is difficult to navigate, especially when the laptop, despite a minor aesthetic face lift and a collection of new features, may not be enough of an upgrade for those who recently purchased a MacBook Pro or Air. If you have an aging MacBook Pro Air, one from 2012 or even as far back as 2011, this could be the device for you, especially if you scoffed at Apple’s more expensive Touch Bar equipped versions of the new Mac.

Mo Dabbas lol. like cult of mac and 9to5 mac?? Just kiddin’. I respect your personal opinion. I find the new macbook pro not compelling though. Even CNET (who are relatively pro Apple) are criticizing the product quite a lot. If I am looking for a macbook pro now I would probably search for a used 2015 one. Still a very capable device, broadwell is still a very capable processor and it’s not very different from Skylake. You also get proper ports. I personally don’t get how apple promote the new macbook pro a tool for designers and photographers when the thing doesn’t even has and SD card reader anymore to load up those photos from a DSLR. If one to buy all the dongles needed for the new macbook pro that’s an extra 100 bucks if not more. Also, did apple forget about their other macs?? Seems like everybody forgot that the iMac, mac mini and mac pro has been the same for the past 2-4 years. I was expecting a refresh for at least one of those Patrick O’Rourke I think updates to the other Macs are still coming, they just weren’t at this keynote. The thing that surprises me is that some people actually thought Apple was going to release an affordable $1500 Mac with higher-end hardware, when that has never been what the company does with its laptops. They’re always pricey, but what you’re paying for is build quality and a specific aesthetic look rather than hardware. shuelin I suspect my 2014 MacBook Pro will be my last, paying over $2000 (taxes) for a laptop is simply too much for mine, and probably others, budgets. Geoff W. That price is nuts, sorry. Does it at least come with some Vaseline, or Percocets, or maybe a coupon for a free lobotomy completion? Stinky There isn’t really any need to shroud the term “oxide TFT” in mystery or to colour it as a term that Apple made up for the occasion. The technology is a real thing and is more than a decade old. WikiPedia is a good place to start. Patrick O’Rourke I think you’re missing the point completely. Yes, oxide TFT is a real thing, sure, but it isn’t exactly common knowledge. Apple throws out words like this all the time at their press conferences and it’s getting tiresome. Bob Loblaw How much do you guys get paid by Apple to write these puff pieces? Patrick O’Rourke I get paid exclusively via in-app purchases in Clash of Clans. Cowpoke You told ‘im…you told ‘im gooood. Stinky I, for one, welcome our new no longer slopped body. For obvious subtle aesthetic reasons. Kven Discounting the fact that it only has 2 ports, I find it absolutely hilarious that you can’t plug in an iPhone without an adapter, yet you can plug in most new android phones. If Steve Jobs was still around he’d be firing people left right and centre. Will Maitner How is this really any different than when computers dropped the serial port in favor of the USB port? And even most new Android phones still come with MicroUSB, not USB C. Tom Gray I agree with Kven in this sense. I’m a huge Apple fan. I got an older MacBook Air 2011 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Let’s say I buy the new MacBook Pro, take it home and suddenly 2 weeks later my iPhone gets an error and throws me into recovery mode, which requires me to plug it into my MacBook. My first assumption would be, just grab my cable and plug it in…. whoops… now I have to travel back to buy an adapter to connect 2 products that are suppose to work hand in hand? it’s just a terrible idea to have a proprietary port on your phone, include the cable for your phone, but make it so it doesn’t fit your computer. BetelgeuseOrion it is different, they released the iphone 7 only a couple months ago, and the new line of MBP a couple days ago. you would think they designed everything to work “seamlessly” in the closed apple wall garden but its a complete joke. Cowpoke You’re right, dude-bro…I’m cryin’ too. The Iceman Cometh The guy is rolling in his grave for sure. jay why you guys complaing about the price? when i saw the keynote right they ship with the LG monitors. so whats the big deal getting two extra screens and a high end laptop… hahaha never saw such a negative comments after an apple keynote. wondering why? Bob Loblaw Bill Burr on the legacy of Steve Jobs: “New phone can’t fit the old charger, This is your hero?” Cowpoke Right. Some folks’ll cry about anything right…?

It sports a thinner and lighter all-metal design with a new oversized trackpad, a redesigned keyboard, upgraded specs, four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, Touch ID, and of course, the not-so-secret OLED touch strip replacing the function key row. The latter is officially known as TouchBar and as expected it will show different shortcut buttons based on what app is open. One might be quick to dismiss it as gimmicky but a few minutes into the demonstration, it was easy to see how it can be genuinely useful, versatile and flexible. It can be used to browse Safari, access predictive typing and emojis, adjust volume, or edit photos, navigating a video without leaving full-screen mode, and more. For now TouchBar is primarily tuned to the company’s own software offerings but developers are able to add support for the new feature in their own apps. Key partners including Adobe and Microsoft are committed to adding support in Creative Suite and Office. There’s a dedicated virtual button for Siri on the main TouchBar screen, and users can further customize the bar by dragging and dropping buttons from a Notification Center-like pane that pops up from the bottom of the screen. Over to the right is the Touch ID sensor covered in sapphire glass, allowing users to login with just their fingerprint — the feature supports multi-user setups so you can quickly switch between accounts with a finger scan. Aside from password-free logins, Touch ID can also be used to authenticate Apple Pay purchases, so you can skip all the form filling process on sites that support the payment option. All sensitive data and private keys required for Touch ID to work will be kept on a new T1 chip that includes a secure enclave, similar to how this works on the iPhone and iPad. In terms of design, this is the thinnest and lightest version of the Pro to date. The 13-inch model is just 14.9 millimeters thin, or 17 percent thinner than the previous generation. It's also 23 percent smaller in volume, and weighs 3 pounds, almost a half a pound less than its predecessor. The 15-inch model is 15.5 millimeters thin, or 14 percent thinner than the last model. It also has 20 percent less volume, and weighs in at 4 pounds. The redesigned Force Touch trackpad is twice as large as the trackpad on the previous generation — it’s ridiculously large. The keyboard has also been updated with the second-generation of Apple’s “butterfly” switch mechanism that debuted on the 12-inch MacBook. The new Pros come with Intel’s sixth-generation Core i5 and Core i7 processors, Intel Iris or AMD Radeon Pro graphics, fast SSD storage and a new cooling system. Both the 13- and 15-inch have four Thunderbolt 3 ports in USB-C form factor and any one of them can be used for hooking up peripherals, displays, storage or for charging (MagSafe is gone). The headphone jack is still there in case you were worried, but the SD card slot isn’t. The new MacBook Pro’s display is 67% brighter and shows 25% more color than Apple’s previous generation Pro laptop, while battery life remains at 10 hours. The 13-inch models start at $1,799 featuring a dual-core, 2.9 GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and integrated Iris graphics. The 15-inch models will set you back at least $2,399 for a quad-core 2.6 GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and discrete AMD Radeon Pro 450 graphics. Apple is also selling a version of the 13-inch Pro with conventional function keys for $1,499, though it also drops the number of ports to two and uses an Iris 540 GPU instead of the 550.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Apple Apple's new MacBook Pros arrive: A great redesign, but at a price By Brooke Crothers Published October 28, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks under a graphic of the new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino, California, U.S. Oct. 27, 2016. (REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) Apple’s new MacBook Pros are finally here. It’s a killer redesign, but with a price tag to match. Call it sticker shock. The cheapest of Apple’s high-performance line of MacBooks starts at $1,499. If you want the Pros with the touted Touch Bar then it jumps to $1,799 for the 13-inch model and $2,399 for the 15 incher. Twitter users reacted quickly to the pricing on Thursday. The tenor of many of the tweets was “I like the Touch Bar but hate the price.” APPLE REVAMPS MACBOOK PROS WITH NEW KEYBOARD TECH “The price is high, but that's nothing new for Apple,” Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, told FoxNews.com. “They do know what they're doing, however, as demonstrated by how much money they make,” he added. And Apple is getting praise for Touch Bar -- the strip of virtual function keys that change dynamically based on what the user is doing. “I think the Touch Bar is very innovative and a real improvement for laptop [user experience],” Daniel Matte, an analyst at Canalys, told FoxNews.com. New tech lets Apple raise its prices. “The increases, while surprising, are completely in line with the changes that Apple has been making across its other product lines,” Rhoda Alexander, director, Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told FoxNews.com. APPLE UNVEILS NEW IPHONES: THE IPHONE 7 AND 7 PLUS She continued. “The iPhone average price increased with the introduction of the larger smartphones, as did the iPad average with the launch of the iPad Pros. This will drive a similar change across their notebooks,” she said. Apple will still sell you older systems like the existing 13-inch MacBook Air for $999 and the last-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro for $1,299. But, again, for designs that are long in the tooth, that’s not exactly cheap. Windows competition PC makers like HP present enticing alternatives, hundreds of dollars less but still loaded with the latest tech – if you can do without the Touch Bar and the very-high-resolution Apple Retina display. MICROSOFT LAUNCHES SURFACE STUDIO AT WINDOWS 10 EVENT HP, for example, has just updated its well-received 13-inch HP Spectre x360 – a stunning, ultra-thin, all-aluminum laptop with a 360-degree rotating display. It weighs only 2.85 pounds and is 0.54 inches thick, comparing favorably to the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is slightly heavier and thicker. The Spectre is offered with Intel’s latest 7th Generation processor, not the prior-generation 6th gen Intel chip used on the new MacBook Pros. The 13-inch Spectre x360 is priced at $1,159.99 for a model with Intel’s newest chip and a 1,920-by-1,080 touch display. Dell also offers robust configurations of its popular 13-inch XPS 13 – updated recently with 7th gen Intel chips – pricing for the 256GB hard drive version of the XPS 13 starts at $1,149.99.   “Some people will say that Apple integrates it all better, but I suspect that will matter to only a small subset of the market,” Endpoint’s Kay said.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Tech CEO who vowed to murder Donald Trump with a sniper rifle resigns 2 Microsoft rolls out Black Friday deals 3 Smartphone residue says a lot about you, including your secrets 4 US Navy denies software piracy in $596 million lawsuit 5 Secret software in some Android phones sent data to China, experts warn See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Democrat Russ Feingold, 63, the only lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001, leads incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in the state in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Johnson, 61, rode a wave of support from conservative Tea Party activists to victory six years ago, sweeping Feingold out of office. But polls this year have consistently shown Feingold ahead, although recent surveys show a tighter race. Privacy advocates and former Feingold staffers said they expected Feingold, if returned to office, to be sympathetic to the privacy concerns of technology companies and civil liberties groups on issues such as encryption and domestic spying, at a time when many lawmakers are being pressured to confront security threats from Islamic State and other militant groups. The Feingold campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other tech giants have tussled in recent years with government agencies over how much user data the companies should be forced to retain and share with investigators hunting for criminal suspects or national security threats. Those tensions grew after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secrets about U.S. surveillance practices in 2013. They reached a crescendo earlier this year when the FBI tried to force Apple to unlock an iPhone tied to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, California, attack that killed 14 people. Chief among the goals of many companies and privacy advocates is reforming a foreign intelligence authority used to justify once-secret broad internet surveillance programs exposed by Snowden that will expire in December 2017 unless Congress reauthorizes them. Should Feingold return to Capitol Hill, former staffers said he would probably seek a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he would have privileged access to classified information about government spying. Feingold’s campaign has received far more contributions than Johnson’s from donors employed by tech companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google and Intel Corp, a review of U.S. Federal Election Commission records showed. Voted against Patriot Act Digital privacy activists have long regarded Feingold as an ally and aggressive overseer of the intelligence community, a reputation he burnished as the sole vote against the USA Patriot Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, expanding the government’s surveillance capabilities. In a speech from the Senate floor at the time, Feingold raised concerns that one provision would allow the government to “go on a fishing expedition and collect information on virtually anyone.” Leaks from Snowden in 2013 showed the provision Feingold questioned was later secretly interpreted to conduct bulk surveillance on U.S. phone metadata. That program was curtailed by Congress in 2015. Feingold “was a true leader in fighting indiscriminate mass surveillance of innocent Americans,” U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who also is among congressional skeptics of government spying, said in a statement. Wisconsin typically leans Democratic during high-turnout presidential election years, a problem for Johnson, who won by nearly 5 points in 2010 running as a small-government outsider. “It was pretty clear that 2010 was a wave election and there was nothing that (Feingold) could have done to fend off the challenge from Ron Johnson,” said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson has attempted to use Feingold’s 18-year Senate record to portray him as soft on national security. William Allison, a Johnson campaign spokesman, added that Feingold had been “willing to completely mislead Wisconsinites about his weak record on national security.” Reuters Tags: Data privacy, Democrat, Patriot Act, privacy, Ron Johnson, Russ Feingold, Silicon Valley, technology Also read The cyber law series: How data privacy and surveillance have crept into the workplace Managing data privacy in the era of data breaches X Recommended For You China’s new cybersecurity law: Don’t claim sovereignty over cyberspace in the name of cybersecurity EU data protection watchdogs warn WhatsApp, Yahoo on privacy Italy antitrust agency probes WhatsApp messaging service over data-sharing with Facebook Unnoticed change in Google’s Privacy Policy enables more invasive online ad tracking Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing said: “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever Building on innovations pioneered in the 12-inch MacBook, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Touch ID comes to the Mac Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac®, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay® on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. Apple’s brightest, most colorful notebook display The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. The most powerful MacBook Pro yet Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance . The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3 which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port – allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. Pricing & availability The 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at £1,449/$1,499, features a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships immediately. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the revolutionary Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at £1,749/$1,799, and features a 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships in two to three weeks. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at £2,349/$2,399, features the revolutionary Touch Bar and Touch ID, a 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage, and ships in two to three weeks Tags: Apple, featured, MacBook Pro, touch bar, Touch ID Share on Facebook Share Twitter Plus one on Google Plus Save on Stumble Upon Pin on Pintrest Share on Reddit On sale today Buy Online Subscribe Now View Digital Editions ×Close Hello again!

(Times-Tribune File) Voters in the 112th Legislative District who justifiably are weary of the internecine warfare between Rep. Frank Farina, the incumbent Democrat, and Kevin Haggerty, a former state representative who beat Mr. Farina in the Democratic primary, have a fine alternative. The Times-Tribune editorial board endorses Republican Ernest Lemoncelli over Mr. Haggerty. Republicans who hoped for Democratic warfare when they cynically gerrymandered the 112th district got more than they expected. Mr. Farina formerly represented the 115th District; Mr. Haggerty formerly represented the 112th. After parts of the districts were rigged into the new 112th, any camaraderie that the two might have enjoyed dissolved into a best-of-three-falls struggle for the seat. With the bitter primary campaign over, the mercurial Mr. Haggerty has decided to rely on the Democratic registration advantage in the district. He declined to meet with this newspaper’s editorial board, and has declined to debate. This has enabled him to evade questions about the military service that he has touted and his attendance and voting records in Harrisburg. Mr. Lemoncelli, 61, of the Eynon section of Archbald, is a former industrial electronics sales representative and manager who now helps operate his wife’s travel agency. He credits the purchasing and managing practices of some of his former clients, including NASA, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Intel and others, as informing his view of how the state government should operate. He favors expansion of sales and other taxes and closing the Delaware corporate tax loophole as the means of reducing school property taxes. And, again relying on career experience, he favors programs supporting technical support job training. Mr. Lemoncelli is thoughtful rather than blindly ideological, and would be a conscientious, drama-free state representative.

Hybrid cloud storage software provider Cloudian has fortified itself for more sales warfare in the cutthroat flash storage appliance market. The San Francisco-based company said Oct. 27 that it has completed a $41 million financing round, which includes new investors Lenovo, City National Bank, Epsilon Venture Partners and DVP Investment. Also participating were existing investors Intel Capital, INCJ, Eight Roads (the proprietary investment arm of FIL, Fidelity International Limited) and Goldman Sachs. The funding brings Cloudian's total capital raised to date to $79 million. The company said the new funds will fuel growth by accelerating development, expanding sales and marketing and growing international operations to meet the rising demand for scale-out, hybrid cloud, object storage solutions. Designed for On-Premises Hybrid Clouds Cloudian's HyperStore appliances run on its own storage software. Both are designed to run on-premises-based hybrid cloud systems. HyperStore software can be deployed on a user's existing hardware or preinstalled on a HyperStore appliance. Features include hybrid cloud streaming, virtual nodes, configurable erasure coding and data compression and encryption to go with standard system management control, monitoring capabilities and reporting. Cloudian's object-based storage aims to provide both on-premises and public cloud storage within a single distributed file system (similar to Cleversafe, Scality and EMC Atmos). Cloudian's key value proposition is providing a single storage pool between on-prem and public cloud at an economical price point. During the past year, Cloudian said it has accelerated customer acceptance with 300 percent increase in bookings, 100 percent growth in its customer base and 100 percent customer retention. Cloudian customers value the company's modular, scale-out design that allows a single storage manager to effectively manage hundreds of petabytes of capacity—a level that would require a dozen or more storage managers with conventional systems. Now Available on AWS In August, Cloudian announced the availability of Cloudian HyperStore on AWS Marketplace. This enables customers to purchase their on-premises storage on a metered-by-use basis and manage it alongside Amazon S3 storage as a single pool, and receive a single invoice for both. Last June, Cloudian and Lenovo announced an OEM agreement that enables Lenovo's worldwide sales force to offer a Cloudian-based object storage appliance. On Oct. 20, Google announced Google Cloud Storage Coldline, a long-term archival storage service. Cloudian is integrated with Coldline, allowing customers to create a hybrid storage environment for rapid data access and nearly instantaneous search. Users store and retrieve data from the Cloudian system on-premises, while applying policies for automatic data migration to Coldline. When data is migrated, metadata is retained within the Cloudian system, allowing Coldline-stored data to be searched locally to accelerate data discovery. Administrators manage all their data, whether on-premises or in the cloud, as a single storage pool. "Until recently the focus for most storage administrators was to store and manage large amounts of data. Businesses are now looking to analyze this gold mine of data to find patterns that could enhance products or services," said Amita Potnis, an IDC research manager. "Cloudian has tackled both problems with a scale-out design and an integrated insight engine that lets users store and analyze data on the same system." Updated Software Earlier This Year Earlier this year Cloudian announced HyperStore 6.0, a significant platform update that bolstered the product's capabilities with proactive data repair, Amazon S3 cross-region replication for disaster recovery and smart storage features to expand the product's in-platform analytics capabilities. Cloudian HyperStore provides enterprises and managed service provider with petabyte-scale storage, data protection and smart analytics for use cases including backup/archive, media and entertainment, bioinformatics, IoT and more. HyperStore can scale from three nodes to hundreds, allowing systems to be right-sized for any application or organizational need. Cloudian solutions are available as an appliance or as stand-alone software for commodity hardware, and may be configured with a file connector that facilitates CIFS, NFS and FTP services.

The twenty companies BuzzFeed News examined included popular social networks like Twitter and Facebook, incumbent manufacturing giants Dell and Hewlett Packard, and multinational heavyweights Amazon, Intel, Oracle, and Uber. In total, workers for the 20 companies gave about $4.4 million in itemized contributions to Clinton and $146,000 to Trump. Staffers at Google and its parent company Alphabet topped the list at more than $1.1 million donated to the Clinton campaign through September, either directly to Hillary for America or via other “authorized” committees. Clinton’s operation appears to have received more contributions from Google employees than any other employer, in or out of tech. Employees from Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, and Salesforce have also been among Clinton’s top financial backers.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals Reviews MacBook Pro review Hands on: MacBook Pro review Not yet rated By Joe Osborne Laptops & portable PCs  Apple's leading laptop finally catches up – and then some Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict To say the new MacBook Pro is a massive improvement over the previous model would be an understatement. It's more portable and more powerful, not to mention more enjoyable to use. But it's tough to justify the premium for that Touch Bar, no matter how cool it is. For Super-thin and light Touch Bar smartly designed Loads of USB-C ports Huge trackpad Against Touch Bar needs more app support Direct light washes out Touch Bar display Update: Miss something? Check our "Latest developments" section for all of your up-to-date MacBook Pro news. It's finally here: the new-and-improved MacBook Pro, and it seems to have closed the gap between the Pro line and the competition – and them some.  But the MacBook Pro has done so in ways that matter perhaps even more than gigahertz and pixels. This is now Apple's most usable laptop yet. Sure, it's thinner, lighter and more powerful, but the improved keyboard and trackpad set Apple apart in an even bigger way. And that's before we even get to the Touch Bar (though its mileage may vary). MacBook Pro price and release date The spankin' new MacBook Pro is available for pre-order right now. As for when you'll get it should you pre-order, that's another story. The 13-inch version, with standard function keys and two fewer USB-C ports, will ship the day you pre-order it.  MacBook Pro price: how much will it cost me? However, if you want one of the fancy Touch Bar versions, that won't begin shipping until two to three weeks from now. Here's how much the MacBook Pro costs to start, broken down by version: 13-inch MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar): $1,499/£1,449/AU$2,199 13-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar): $1,799/£1,749/AU$2,699 15-inch MacBook Pro: $2,399/£2,349/AU$2,999 Now, let's get into what's new about the refreshed MacBook Pro, and what it feels like to use. Spoiler: it's better – way better. Latest developments With both launches behind us – with and without the Touch Bar – we’re already beginning to consider the next iteration of MacBook Pro. Despite having just reviewed the most recent MacBook Pro, there’s admittedly still room for improvement. Reports have already emerged that a 2017 MacBook Pro refresh is in the works with configurations supporting up to 32GB of RAM, twice of what is offered now. Moreover, Korean tech source ET News believes the next MacBook Pro could even house a full-fledged OLED display in lieu of its current LCD panels. In the meantime, Apple is supporting the current MacBook Pro quite nicely, even treating it to its own front-page App Store section spotlighting Touch Bar-centric apps. Though Apple was open to the idea of the Touch Bar this year, don’t expect a proper touch display anytime soon. In a recent interview, the company exec Phil Schiller called the idea of a touchscreen Mac ‘absurd.’ Design and feel At first glance, not much has changed about the MacBook Pro's design. The profile or silhouette generally remains unchanged, save for finally (sadly) losing the illuminated Apple logo on its lid in favor of chrome. Take a closer look though and you'll see that nearly everything has changed. The 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the new MacBook Pro are 17% and 14% thinner than their predecessors, respectively – to the tune of a 14.9mm-thin 13-incher and a 15.5mm-thin 15-incher. Naturally, with a thinner chassis comes lighter weight. The 13-inch version weighs just three pounds (1.37kg), nearly half a pound lighter than the previous version, while the 15-inch model hits the scale at four pounds (1.83kg), also shaving off nearly half a pound).  While Apple wouldn't let you forget it, that makes the 13-inch MacBook Pro now thinner and lighter than the latest (and likely last) MacBook Air – and picking up the device, you can definitely tell. As for the keyboard, Apple claims its second-generation butterfly hinges vastly improve the typing experience from that on the 12-inch MacBook. Having recently taken the latest 12-inch MacBook for a test drive, we can attest to these improvements. Travel is deeper, and feedback upon releasing your fingers from a key is punchier. Frankly, this is what the first iteration of the new MacBook keyboard should have been – of course, that's easy to say. The Force Touch trackpad has also been hugely improved. For one, the thing is damn enormous – twice as spacious as that on the previous model. This is the kind of trackpad we've wanted for a long time on MacBooks, and we finally have it. Plus, activating Force Touch functions, like word lookups, requires much less, well, force than before. The Touch Bar, and how it works Now, talking about how the new MacBook Pro feels to use brings us to the tiny elephant in the room: the Touch Bar with Touch ID. It's a Retina (read: OLED) touch display underneath a matte surface, and that's key: it means way less smudging on a screen you're supposed to be touching all the time. And if you're wondering how this little screen performs under direct light, the answer is – like any matte screen – not very well. But it's not as if the screen's content is indiscernible under such conditions – there's just a blatant difference between its look under direct and indirect light. As you'd expect from Apple, the way the Touch Bar works is stupid simple. For one, in general use, the Touch Bar just replicates the media-first functions you're used to from previous MacBooks. But, when you enter an app supported by the Touch Bar directly – like most Apple-made apps and some third parties, like Adobe Photoshop – you're presented with an app-specific icon toward the left of the Touch Bar. Pressing this summons a series of app-specific functions. For instance, when using Messages, this icon renders as a smiley face, offering you the breadth of emojis you're familiar with on your iPhone. It even remembers your most-used emojis if you're using Messages on connected iOS devices via the same Apple ID. Opening the Maps app introduces a directional arrow icon, which when pressed presents a series of specific commands, like walking, public transit and driving directions, or specific types of locations of interest to home in on. The Touch Bar supports 10-point multitouch as well as gestures, though we doubt there will be any applications of the tool requiring all 10 of your digits – assuming you could fit them all on there. All told, the Touch Bar works as seamlessly as you'd expect from the company: Apple wrote the playbook on touch devices, practically.  Regardless, that still doesn't make the Touch Bar hugely useful – we're having a hard time seeing anything that the Touch Bar can do vastly better or more easily than the MacBook Pro's much-improved keyboard and trackpad. Even before the improvements, weren't they just fine? (Well, except for DJing: this thing is going to be a record-scratcher's dream.) What's inside Powering the entire range of MacBook Pro models, including the one sans Touch Bar and with just two USB-C ports, are 6th-generation (or Skylake) Intel processors – not the brand new Kaby Lake chips. (The 13-inch models offer dual-core i5 or i7, while the 15-inch model offers quad-core versions of those chips.) You may be wondering why Apple hasn't equipped its larger MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake. The short answer, which was confirmed by an Apple employee who spoke to Gizmodo, is that no quad-core Kaby Lake processor is currently available. The Skylake chip that features may not be latest-gen, but it's the fastest quad-core chip available. Backing that up is Intel integrated graphics on the 13-inch models. Meanwhile the 15-inch version offers AMD Radeon Pro 450 graphics with 2GB of video RAM to start (you can also upgrade to the Radeon Pro 460 chip with double the video RAM). As for storage, all models start with 256GB of solid-state storage, upgradeable to 1TB in the 13-inch versions and up to a massive 2TB in the 15-inch version. Apple claims all of these drives are markedly faster than those in previous MacBook Pros – we'll have to test that claim in our full review.  One the memory front, the 13-inch models start with 8GB of RAM, upgradeable to 16GB. The 15-incher comes with a maximum of 16GB, a decision that was explained by Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller in an emailed response to a MacRumors reader who queried the absence of a 32GB option. "To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn't be efficient enough for a notebook," Schiller noted. All of this sits behind Apple's Retina display that, save for a 67% increase in brightness and the same boost in contrast, remains the same resolution. So, that's 2560 x 1600 on the 13-incher, and 2800 x 1800 on the 15-inch model. Regardless, the screen looks as gorgeous as ever, and media professionals will appreciate the wider color gamut. The connectivity on offer amounts to four USB-C ports with Thunderbolt and charging, while 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 round out the package. Of course, none of this saves you from having to buy at least one adapter – especially if you're an iPhone user who likes to hard-wire. Early verdict There's no doubt that this is the best MacBook Pro ever made. It's thinner, lighter and more powerful, and has improved inputs on top of a brand new one, the Touch Bar. If you're in the market for a laptop upgrade, you just found one of the most worthy options around. But we're having trouble reconciling the Touch Bar with the premium it commands over the version with standard function keys and half the USB-C ports.  Buy the new MacBook Pro right here It costs another 300 bucks to get an insanely cool feature that, frankly, you might not even use. (Compound that with being asked to pay $400 more for the new entry-level MacBook Pro than before – ouch.) All told, though, this is the long-overdue MacBook Pro refresh we've been waiting for. The MacBook Pro was lagging behind the competition for a while there, but now it's caught up, and in some respects – beyond simply 'more power' – it's surpassed its rivals. To find out by how much, you'll have to wait for our full review. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Joe Osborne Joe has worked in games and technology media for nearly a decade for several publications.

"Is America some sort of banana republic? America is a great power. Please correct me if I'm wrong," Putin said Thursday, speaking at the Valdai Club, an annual gathering of Russian and international world policy experts.

Hillary Clinton's campaign has accused Russia of hacking campaign chairman John Podesta's email account, although WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied that Russian hackers are supplying him material. Russian hackers, possibly state-linked, have also been implicated in attacks on voting systems in several U.S. states. Putin has previously denied Russia's involvement. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the Obama administration was certain of Russia's involved in the email attacks, but there wasn't as much clarity on the voting-system breaches. Kerry, speaking at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, also expressed confidence in the American election system, saying it would be difficult for any country to impact vote counting, because "those are state-run operations and they are not on the open Internet."

"Trump has chosen his own way of reaching the hearts of the voters," Putin said. "He is acting extravagantly, but not so pointlessly." "He represents the interests of the part of the society tired of the elites that have held power for decades," he added. "He is representing the common people, and he is acting like a common guy himself."

Trump has repeatedly refused to give credence to the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Russia's complicity in the hacks, despite being briefed on the issue.

Putin has slammed Clinton for allegedly stirring insurrection in Russia in 2012.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items Saimin (Blog) - October 29, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Apple’s new MacBook Pro comes in two sizes, 13 inch and 15 inch. It comes with a touch bar and touch sensitive display along with a touch ID sensor.       It will go in the market from $1400.00 to 1,700.00 and higher. The Apple TV, iPad and iPhone has TV app in USA.  TV app allows you to select the show that you want to watch from one central location and moves straight into the correct app.   As this has been the case in the past, the Apple app does not support Netflix, and jumping to correct app does not work in this case.  MBP 13 inch does not have new Touch Bar but it is repudiation of the top-end laptops layout.  The new MacBook Pro is a thinner and lighter Laptop with Touch ID fingerprint scanners but nether USB-A ports and SD card slot nor MagSafe power adapter. Instead it has quick access to emoji with Touch Bare, and 3.5 mm headphone socket.   To use existing accessories with the new Laptop, you will need adapters, which are not included.   EMOJI:  to use the Emoji feature, position the cursor in any text field that you would like to insert an emoji like a tweet then press the command + control key+ press the space bar and click on the Emoji icon on the sidebar. Here is an emoji box example.           The new laptop has OLED panel, which is better than standard keyboard, which replaces multi—function F keys and allows shortcuts to control window management and volume functions.  According to Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple: “It’s a retina display, multitouch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software you’re using.”     Stephen Lam- Getty images     You could see emoji or Emoticons on the keyboard displayed, which was demonstrated at the Apple Event on October 27,2016 in Cupertino. Also, more about the functionality of Touch Bar was discussed and shown by Graig Fedeighi senior vice president of software engineering for Apple.           According to Apple media discussion at Cupertino’s event, the new 13 inch MBP can be upgraded with the Intel dual–core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256 GB storage and Iris 550 with a faster gaming, video editing and 3D graphics performance, than previous versions.   According to Tony Avelar/ EPA.  Four Thunderbolt 3 USB–C mean that all old USB accessories will require adapter to connect them to new MacBook Pro.                                    If you are in the market for purchasing one, make sure to shop around, also it would be a bad idea if you wait a week or so for more reviews to come out with real pricing. However, we recognized in the past that Apple products do well with testing and this may be another one that just took or will take over the market. It sounds too phenomenal to ignore.   "So if you want to save the planet, feel free to drive your Hummer.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Cuplex Kryos Next water block is heaven for control freaks by Eric Frederiksen  5:13 PM on October 28, 2016 Information about the operating conditions of one's PC is worthless unless it's easy to obtain and even easier to understand. That's the goal with Aqua Computer's new Cuplex Kryos Next water block. Aqua Computer claims the block has the best cooling performance on the market, of course, but that's not what sets it apart. New to the Cuplex Kryos Next is what Aqua Computer is calling "Vision Technology." Certain Kryos Next blocks are available with an OLED display that can be configured using the company's Aquasuite software to show info like CPU temperature and load. If you choose the block with a plexiglass housing, you'll be able to program an LED to change colors in response to changes in any of the statistics the software is monitoring. Aqua Computer also offers builders a tantalizing level of adjustment with its "Vario Technology." Hex nuts allow DIYers to use an Allen wrench to adjust the shape of the cold plate to get an optimal match between the CPU heat spreader and water block. If this feature works as Aqua Computer claims, it could take some major headaches out of gettting the most from a liquid-cooling setup. The block is available with housings in transparent acetal, black acetal, copper, nickel-plated brass, and a dark PVD-coated brass. If that's not enough of an option sheet, the Kryos Next can be had with bases in copper, nickel-plated copper, and sterling silver. It can be purchased with or without the Vision and Vario technology, too. Variants for AMD, Intel LGA 115x, and LGA 2011-v3 sockets are available, as well. The Next is currently available in Aqua Computer's store and starts at about $65, though prices can go much higher if buyers tick all the boxes.

Right now we return to more of or to wait Maru Loney and 48 slug Sports Radio WEEI. I would just sort out there which is probably more frightening to any of those who have hate. But Donald Trump this latest breaking news James can only has come out and said that the FBI is now reviewing new email. Related to Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state according to a letter sent to eight congressional committee chairman. A real surprise development with eleven days left in the elections so remember he recommended this year that the Department of Justice not press charges. Against Hillary coal clean out in that letter said that recent developments urge him to take another look. And so. This thing's going to be hanging because they're not gonna come to a conclusion but there's a possibility that WikiLeaks could be leaking out these emails that they're talking about. But this had been a closed case and not call me is talking about or putting this case again to eleven days before the election and go in November 8. With no resolution. Can't exonerated and it is for me hanging. But as you said she can pardon herself I. That if she I want you to. Self if she went to the partners if she loses. O'Donnell's talk about what you're not a well he can happen to drop didn't I tell you what this is why story that is breaking it was right through. Bring it Kelly right now to Alter of Brady gala hands right now is that it'll. Getting belief faced over this right now until I was gonna take off this week North Carolina go to the games this weekend that amount at Wrigley Field. He looked up well apparently what else. And his body. Yes I'd. A 150000. Dollars. Per parent come seats for Sunday night hundreds. And that the 8000 also I think that that was a little bit out of your wrote on your budget I guess I just thought that you know. I'll just go to some of the bars around the neighborhood. But this one pub is is that dates back HB AC pub. H regularly newly CI it would floated it used to be an air conditioning company and they suddenly selflessness when virulent Christian so you wanna go wanna go to a bar. He's sure to watch the World Series right here in redevelopment love him Kate's Acosta with thousand dollars to reserve a table. Fear that the six person table words 250 dollar meal package. Per person. So for six people to go get a table it's gonna be 2500. Dollars to go to a bar it's great to sit and watch TV. 22500. To sing a bar watched TV sectors you'll do it but you know you get for our food and beverage package which includes beer Warren. Well cocktails at all you can eat pizza and wings. Man yet doesn't know that doesn't include meat or drinks of Iraq's Shia support rental that's such truth. But you do get a bottle of grey goose that it bolivars echo so that's twenty. Five. Hundred dollars everywhere else all of these places. Have with that John Barley corn. Committing to 500 dollar cable reservation 250 dollar meal packages across every whistle table for. It's like 15100 dollars. Some just have a 300 dollar cover just figured no seat. No guarantee seat just blocking and hang out. And it's unbelievable. And 500 dollars for it was six to watch the game on TV I only came out I can't pick crown. Should should a free I don't pay. That yeah but that he had the experience they get to experience in the memory of losing Hilton when they'd lose again. And yet to go another 108 years have been able to find anybody was a lot analyst and they want the World Series underneath years ago knob they're operating about like that it matters that you'll all the old that they put the front row like they actually. Got in my average sport I am Bruton against the so badly. I want landlord had just a huge night tonight I want to put so badly need a really till I mean a bit. Already am sick of them eight and they put it up the same fraudulent celebrities is a Bill Murray singing you just have to log into the ball. Parker says he has done it and we're gonna all out there. That'd be tonight date tonight with squeeze a little bit but it got to I am impressed and now to the cubs have responded no doubt total wanted to dodgers' number I'm unimpressed. The way they've looked. You know there have been natural overstepped Leo feel to be better off the bench but there are very very good team they are probably the better team we off I think believe that. It's just that tonight you know Tomlin Hendrix. I like clover over Lackey had no short days' rest so he really can tighten it up a little bit that Indians can pull this one got the cheapest place where they'll most likely go to Cleveland down. Preemptive drives most likely Cummings cubby bear what's going to bear a beaver it's only hundred dollar copper. They haven't figured out that the company payers of the charge you 100 bucks to get in there to watch their teeth and and then from that point you you can buy your crap. It's going to cost the probably up Giorgio little button and you can eat food. But it only gush out of let's cover with that included just to cover the cup this is a hundred dollar cover to watch a TV sat. Don't even get like an act. Nothing managed to do me on the whole record. I drink minimum. I can't sit there a hundred bucks I can see that you know you're down that you wanna be part of it right you're in a barter critical not and that's a lot of fun. But you know reserve tables for thousand dollars. You don't need it 15100 dollars for the six people to sit there and have the little food meal package which includes beer and wings unique pizza and wings here's what's stupid about it. There are only doing this they're they're the only charge in the up charger for all this money. For home game now road games the bars and restaurants are open and people show up there but it's the normal price. So what difference does it if you are sitting in the cubby bear with John Barley corn. If it's a game or road game you're still watching it on a 65 inch screen on the war notice you know what seriously what it so after they when you can leave. On that series to after you when you can leave and just hang on the street be part of that the warmth of being able but you. Well there's a you'll be handled the the seats they haven't top of these bars yet not not even in Wrigley another outsider there a straight across the street they're outside. They're not even in the stadium a thousand bucks. A thousand. Dollars. To six. Outside the stadium you know it's like her daughter. Knotted at right while inside the stadium it's it's what we're. The same thing for the Super Bowl only do they have what are party frustrate me. Outlawed even like. All suitable to have a Super Bowl party with an event with drinks and food and you'll have to charge. For the country and that's effort that's an interest in the site of the Super Bowl Glenn like a bench and assembly they charge cover people go there one that watched the game on the big screen bad food. And they charge a cover him into the ocean most of the people catch on now because the tickets went up the dollar and Intel board just wanting to go they want. You wanna have the Super Bowl experts will be flat out of the host city they hang out party. And instead of go into the game which they can or they may buy some total package deal that cores like. It was like what it's like at the hotel common well. Charge you a thousand dollars for Red Sox playoff game to stand on the Rupp. With a lot for the liberty financial I'd mile away you could see the light stuff. Thousand dollars it in the rooftop. Nodded in the ballpark you say you were there.

The Standard HOME NEWS OPINION BUSINESS SPORTS SHOWBITZ LIFESTYLE TOPICAL Other Sections The Standard Poll Motoring Real Estate Tech Visionaries Holiday Specials Quick Links Mobile Online Reader Supplements The Standard About Advertise Contact Subscribe Advertisement Home   /   BUSINESS Qualcomm buys NXP for $47b in mega deal posted October 28, 2016 at 11:10 pm by  AFP By Maude Brulard THE HAGUE, Netherlands―US semiconductor maker Qualcomm said Thursday it will buy Dutch rival NXP in a $47-billion mega-deal to extend its footprint into the internet of things and the automobile sector. In the biggest ever deal in the semiconductor market, the agreement will boost the US company amid falling mobile phone sales and stiff market competition. According to the unanimous agreement published Thursday, Qualcomm will offer NXP a $110 per share cash deal, 11.5 percent above Wednesday’s market close, the US company said in a statement. That would value the company, based in the Netherlands but quoted on the New York Nasdaq index, at $47 billion (43 billion euros). “With innovation and invention at our core, Qualcomm has played a critical role in driving the evolution of the mobile industry,” chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said. “The NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy to extend our leading mobile technology into robust new opportunities, where we will be well positioned to lead by delivering integrated semiconductor solutions at scale.”  The deal would help Qualcomm “empower customers and consumers to realize all the benefits of the intelligently connected world,” he added.  The new combined company is forecast to have annual revenues topping $30 billion and serviceable markets of $138 billion in 2020, Qualcomm indicated, adding it hoped the deal would be complete by the end of 2017. Based in the Dutch town of Eindhoven, NXP is a leading maker of chips for the auto industry, as well as for contactless payment systems. A former division of the Dutch electronics giant Philips, it became independent in 2006 and was floated on the stock market in 2010 for $14 a share. Turnover in 2015 was $6.1 billion, with net profits of $1.5 billion. On the Nasdaq, NXP gained 1.6 percent on opening Thursday on the news of its takeover by Qualcomm, which advanced 3.6 percent. “Qualcomm is predominantly exposed to the smartphone market,” technology analyst Janardan Menon, from Liberum, told AFP. “This market has slowed down already, with further slowing ahead. They are also losing some share at Apple to Intel, with the business getting more challenging.” Qualcomm has “virtually no position” in the automotive industry “one of the fastest growing end markets for semiconductors,” he added.  “NXP is the market leader. So by buying NXP they can continue to be a growth story,” Menon said, adding Qualcomm was “one of the few companies with the cash to” snap up the Dutch company.

However, gaming systems and small form-factor (SFF) PCs have weathered the storm particularly well. Many vendors have tried to combine the two, but space constraints and power concerns have ended up limiting the gaming performance of such systems. GIGABYTE, in particular, has been very active in this space with their BRIX Gaming SFF PCs. The BRIX Gaming UHD GB-BNi7HG4-950 that we are reviewing today is the result of GIGABYTE going back to the drawing board with the feedback from the 2014 BRIX Gaming BXi5G-760. The BXi5G-760 combined a GK104 Kepler-based NVIDIA GTX 870M (marketed as a GTX 760) and a Haswell-based Core i5-4200H in a form factor similar to the traditional NUCs. The result of that was a very noisy system that throttled under sustained loading conditions. The BRIX Gaming UHD GB-BNi7HG4-950 aims to fix those complaints with a Skylake-H platform and a discrete Maxwell GPU. Introduction The GIGABYTE BRIX Gaming UHD GB-BNi7HG4-950 is marketed as a powerful UHD-ready gaming mini-PC that is equipped with a desktop-class GTX 950 GPU. It addresses many of the shortcomings of its predecessor in the BRIX Gaming lineup. The small chassis size and multiple cooling fans were major drawbacks in the BXi5G-760. The GB-BNi7HG4-950 solves that by having only one fan at the bottom of the chassis, and increasing the volume of the unit from 0.88L to 2.6L. The CPU is much more powerful (Core i7-6700HQ vs. Core i5-4200H) despite having approximately the same TDP (45W). On the GPU side, the GTX 860M ('GTX 760') has been replaced by the GTX 950 ('overclocked GTX 965M'). Since we don't have exact TDP numbers for these 'rebadged / modified' GPUs, all we can say from our eventual power consumption investigation is that GIGABYTE can handle a more power-hungry GPU without throttling by using the updated chassis and thermal solution. Despite having similar two-dimensional footprints, the height of the GB-BNi7HG4-950 is almost 4x that of the BXi5G-760. Volume-wise, the new chassis comes in at 2.6L (220 mm x 110 mm x 110 mm). The taller chassis allows GIGABYTE to get away with one fan at the bottom that pulls in air and exhausts it through the ventilation slots at the top. This actually turns out to be a very efficient thermal solution, as we shall see further down in this review. GIGABYTE currently has only the barebones version of the GB-BNi7HG4-950 in the North American market. However, our sample was the GB-BNi7HG4-950-MF, which came with one memory slot occupied, a M.2 SATA SSD and a 2.5" hard drive pre-installed. Windows 10 Home was also available for configuration when the unit was booted up. Consumers wishing to get a better experience with the system will probably want to ensure that both memory slots are occupied and a M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD is installed in one of the two available M.2 slots. The full specifications of our review unit are summarized in the table below. GIGABYTE GB-BNi7HG4-950 Specifications Processor Intel Core i7-6700HQ Skylake-H, 4C/8T, 2.6 GHz (Turbo to 3.5 GHz), 14nm, 6MB L2, 45W TDP Memory Micron 16ATF1G64HZ-2G1A2 DDR4 15-15-15-36 @ 2133 MHz 1x8 GB Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 (4GB GDDR5) (Overclocked GTX 965M) Disk Drive(s) Transcend TS128GMTS800 (128 GB; M.2 Type 2280 SATA III; MLC) Western Digital WD10JPVX (WD Blue) (1TB; 2.5in SATA; 5400 RPM) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 (2x2 802.11ac - 867 Mbps) 1x Intel I219-LM Gigabit LAN Audio 3.5mm Headphone Jack + 3.5mm Microphone Jack Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2 (1x Type-A + 1x Type-C) Operating System Retail unit in NA is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing (As configured) $1160 ($1000 barebones) Full Specifications GIGABYTE BRIX Gaming UHD GB-BNi7HG4-950 Specifications In addition to the main unit, the PC package also includes a 180W (19.5V @ 9.23A) power brick along with US power cords and a WLAN antenna. A quick start guide with installation instructions for the memory and disk drives, screws for mounting 2.5" drives, a user manual and a CD with the drivers round up the rest of the package. The gallery below shows the chassis design and a little bit of the internals. The procedure to install the DRAM and the drives are a lot more complicated compared to the other mini-PCs in the market. In order to make things a little bit easier for people who purchase the barebones version, GIGABYTE has a YouTube video of the full teardown / components installation process. Gallery: GIGABYTE BRIX Gaming UHD GB-BNi7HG4-950 Chassis and Internals Unlike the rather plain industrial design of the BXi5G-760, the BNi7HG4-950 moves things up several notches. The sides of the chassis are all brushed aluminum and the top panel is black with LEDs around the perimeter. One of the flat side edges of the chassis has the four display outputs (1x HDMI 2.0 + 3x mini-DP 1.2). The other I/Os are all spread out in one small rectangular panel in the rear. These include three USB 3.0 ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C and a USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A port, audio jacks, a RJ-45 Gigabit LAN port, a power inlet, connections for the antennae and the power button itself. On the whole, the BRIX Gaming UHD impresses in the looks department much more compared to the previous generation. Platform Analysis and BIOS Features The GB-BNi7HG4-950 uses a Skylake-H CPU in conjunction with the Sunrise Point HM170 platform controller hub (PCH). This is similar to the Skull Canyon NUC. However, the latter opts to keep the 16 PCIe lanes off the CPU unconnected. The BRIX, on the other hand, uses 12 of those to enable two different peripherals. In our review configuration, the CPU's PCIe lanes are distributed as below: PCI-E 3.0 x16 port #1    Empty @ x4 (M.2 PCIe SSD) PCI-E 3.0 x16 port #2    In Use @ x8 (nVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M (Gigabyte) Video Adapter, nVIDIA GM206 - High Definition Audio Controller) Out of the 22 available high-speed I/O lanes on the H170 (as shown above), 13 are used. Seven HSIO lanes are be used in PCIe mode as per the configuration below. PCI-E 3.0 x2 port #3    In Use @ x2 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #6    In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 AC 2x2 HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 3.0 x4 port #9    Empty @ x4 (M.2 PCIe/SATA SSD) The Type-A and Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports in the system are from the ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller. The three USB 3.0 ports in the rear panel are likely from HSIO lanes 4 through 6, while the two SATA ports (both supporting 2.5" drives) are likely from lanes 21 and 22. The Intel I219-LM GbE LAN port is, in all probability, connected to HSIO lane 11.   The BIOS features offered by GIGABYTE in its BRIX lineup are rather basic. There are no options for memory overclocking (supported by Skylake-H) and the BIOS doesn't even have an in-built update procedure using a newer version on a USB stick. That said, the available options are more than enough for the users who want a plug-and-play experience once the RAM and disk drive are installed.

Reply aj654987 - Wednesday, November 02, 2016 - link Alienware Alpha r2 with the gtx 960 desktop GPU is a better deal than this. Reply Samus - Wednesday, November 02, 2016 - link I don't think you can get an i7 in the Alpha r2...not that it really matters for gaming, but the extra horsepower of the i7-6700HQ in the Brix might help its GTX950 creep up on the GTX960 in the Alpha r2. But I agree, they are similar in almost every other aspect (even size) and the Alpha r2 is cheaper.

Reply setzer - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Regarding the last comment about going with the Skull Canyon NUC + External GPU. I'm not sure that is really a better solution. It's true that it gives the user the option of adding more graphics power (and easy upgradability), on the other side it also requires buying a discrete graphics card which is not as straight-forward as on desktops. This is because you are restricted on one side by the soldered CPU (which you can not change, thought the Skull Canyon NUC cpu should not be a problem for some time) and on another side by the bandwidth between the system and the external enclosure (just 4 lanes of PCIE 3.0 bandwidth). This last point makes it hard to figure out on what graphics card is actually the best for your restrictions. So instead of a selection of all the graphics cards up to the power limit of the enclosure you have to figure out which ones do actually offer the best price-performance. I.e of course you can drop a Titan there but will the difference to a GTX 965M (over the 16 lanes of PCIE) be significant? Regarding this last point, would it be possible to test external enclosures and figure out actual metrics for the performance gains? Reply wavetrex - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link I wonder if I can build a house out of these bricks ... excuse me, Brix :) Joking aside, very few people would know it's an actual computer. Reply nico_mach - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link It's a SQUARE trash can! Progress! Where's the pedal, tho? Reply hubick - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link I'm typing this on my Skull Canyon NUC, and have a Razer Core, and having read the benchmarks before buying, the PCIe4x limitation is surprisingly small. IIRC, it's somewhere in the ballpark of 10-15% or so, and that doesn't really change when going from a 980's to a 1080 either. It makes sense when you think about it... you're essentially transferring textures, shaders, and a bunch of vector information to the GPU for rendering... and that will be pretty much constant regardless of if you're rendering the output at 720@30hz or 4K@60hz. Reply aj654987 - Wednesday, November 02, 2016 - link why would you even bother with that, might as well build an itx for less money and less clutter.
