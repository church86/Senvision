Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur The Surface Laptop clearly goes up against Apple’s MacBook line-up, particularly the MacBook with the 12-inch display and the MacBook Air 13 with the 13.3-inch display. It is not just a new edition that has been added to the Windows 10 line-up with Windows 10 S, but there is also the Surface Laptop that now becomes the newest addition to the Surface line-up of devices. The basic specifications include the latest generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processors, a 13.5-inch PixelSense Display, USB 3.0 and the Intel HD 620 graphics (Core i5) or the Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (Core i7). Prices start at $999 (around Rs64,000) for the Core i5 machine with 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD, and jump to $1,299 (around Rs83,000) for the version running 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. If you go for the higher-spec Core i7 variants, the first version with 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD is priced at $1,599 (around Rs1,02,000), while the top-spec version with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is priced at $2,199 (around Rs1,40,000). Out of the box, these machines will run the Windows 10 S software, with certain restrictions about what software can be run. Incidentally, if you like the looks of the Surface Laptop, but aren’t entirely sure about the Windows 10 S limitations, Microsoft will allow an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free, until 31 December. Microsoft claims as many as 14.5 hours of battery life on continuous video playback too. The Surface Laptop’s touch display works with the Surface Pen stylus too. The Surface Laptop clearly goes up against Apple’s MacBook line-up, particularly the MacBook with the 12-inch display and the MacBook Air 13 with the 13.3-inch display. The former is priced upwards of Rs1,12,900 while the latter carries a price tag of Rs80,900 onwards but is available at multiple online and offline stores for around Rs55,000 after various discounts and schemes. The Surface Book claims to have superior battery life, to the MacBook Air’s 12-hour battery life, for example. The other big advantage is that the Surface Book runs newer Intel processors and graphics, which could also help battery life figures in real-world usage scenarios. However, for many users, the entire package of a laptop goes beyond just specs. It has a lot to do with the experience of using the software as well, and while Windows 10 remains significantly better than the disaster that was Windows 8, there are still issues that plague it—automatic updates, crashed machines after the Creators Update, inconsistent performance because of hardware and much more. While Microsoft is keenly pushing this to specific users for educational usage, the reality is that such powerful specification and the slick form factor will have a much wider appeal. And at these price points, it will catch the eye of anyone who was planning to buy a MacBook. However, in its standard avatar, the Surface Laptop with the Windows 10 S operating system is no match for the MacOS, simply because of the limitations in terms of running software, games and peripheral drivers. For that, you will need to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which though free till the end of the year, will add $49 more to the overall cost. It will be interesting to see how, and if at all, Apple responds to the Surface Laptop. It will be interesting to see how quickly it flies off the shelves once it hits the stores on 15 June, and that could be when Apple may consider taking some corrective action. But if the previous Surface device sales are anything to go by, Apple wouldn’t be worried about Mac loyalists switching camps just yet.

Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple's to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple's MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market-and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop's affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience-including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft's sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine's evolution, starting from the first prototype-little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices-to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team's pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. "This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team," said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay's team adhered to a "fail-fast" philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. Microsoft, Apple Scramble to Capture US Schools After Google's Success In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that's more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn't stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because "it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling." The designers couldn't poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many "anechoic" chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that's tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the "S" came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware-a selling point long touted by Apple's iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google's Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be "same on commencement day as it is on graduation day." (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won't be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft's app store. "Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft," Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch-and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn't had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team "created what we know our customers are asking for." Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple's OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft's first real laptop. "In the end," he said, "it's going to appeal to everyone." © 2017 Bloomberg L.P. For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Guru3D.com » News » Intel patches remote execution that dates back to 2008 Intel patches remote execution that dates back to 2008 by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 05/02/2017 02:11 PM | Source | 11 comment(s) Intel has patched a remote execution big that dates back to 2008. Millions of Intel workstation and server chips have harbored a security flaw that can be potentially exploited to remotely control and infect systems with spyware. The news reaches us today through the register who picked up on it in depth. The bug is in Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) firmware versions 6 to 11.6. According to Intel , the security hole allows "an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products: That means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware – right under the nose of the operating system – and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on, using AMT's features. This is potentially possible across the network because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. These insecure management features have been available in various, but not all, Intel chipsets for nearly a decade, starting with the Nehalem Core i7 in 2008, all the way up to this year's Kaby Lake Core parts. Crucially, the vulnerability lies at the very heart of a machine's silicon, out of sight of the operating system, its applications and any antivirus. The programming blunder can only be fully addressed with a firmware-level update, and it is present in millions of chips. It is effectively a backdoor into computers all over the world. The vulnerable AMT service is part of Intel's vPro suite of processor features. If vPro is present and enabled on a system, and AMT is provisioned, unauthenticated miscreants on your network can access the computer's AMT controls and hijack them. If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers. If you don't have vPro or AMT present at all, you are in the clear. Intel reckons the vulnerability affects business and server boxes, because they tend to have vPro and AMT present and enabled, and not systems aimed at ordinary folks, which typically don't. You can follow this document to check if your system is vulnerable – and you should. Basically, if you're using a machine with vPro and AMT features enabled, you are at risk. Modern Apple Macs, although they use Intel chips, do not ship with the AMT software, and are thus in the clear. According to Intel today, this critical security vulnerability, labeled CVE-2017-5689, was discovered and reported in March by Maksim Malyutin at Embedi. To get Intel's patch to close the hole, you'll have to pester your machine's manufacturer for a firmware update, and in the meantime, try the mitigations here. These updates, although developed by Intel, must be cryptographically signed and distributed by the manufacturers. It is hoped they will be pushed out to customers within the next few weeks. They should be installed ASAP. "In March 2017 a security researcher identified and reported to Intel a critical firmware vulnerability in business PCs and devices that utilize Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), or Intel Small Business Technology (SBT)," an Intel spokesperson said. "Consumer PCs are not impacted by this vulnerability. We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability. We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible." Specifically, according to Intel: An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology (SBT). Apparently, Intel's Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to privilege escalation via the network. Whether you're using AMT, ISM or SBT, the fixed firmware versions to look out for are, depending on the processor family affected: First-gen Core family: 6.2.61.3535 Second-gen Core family: 7.1.91.3272 Third-gen Core family: 8.1.71.3608 Fourth-gen Core family: 9.1.41.3024 and 9.5.61.3012 Fifth-gen Core family: 10.0.55.3000 Sixth-gen Core family: 11.0.25.3001 Seventh-gen Core family: 11.6.27.3264 "The short version is that every Intel platform with AMT, ISM, and SBT from Nehalem in 2008 to Kaby Lake in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole," explained semiconductor industry journo Charlie Demerjian earlier today. First of all, does your system even support AMT? AMT requires a few things: 1) A supported CPU 2) A supported chipset 3) Supported network hardware 4) The ME firmware to contain the AMT firmware Merely having a "vPRO" CPU and chipset isn't sufficient - your system vendor also needs to have licensed the AMT code. Under Linux, if lspci doesn't show a communication controller with "MEI" or "HECI" in the description, AMT isn't running and you're safe. If it does show an MEI controller, that still doesn't mean you're vulnerable - AMT may still not be provisioned. If you reboot you should see a brief firmware splash mentioning the ME. Hitting ctrl+p at this point should get you into a menu which should let you disable AMT. Fixing this requires a system firmware update in order to provide new ME firmware (including an updated copy of the AMT code). Many of the affected machines are no longer receiving firmware updates from their manufacturers, and so will probably never get a fix.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

Agreed - just look at the phrasing of the article. It repeatedly explains how and why these are security risks but I didn't see anywhere they mentioned what these features were intended for (in a secure manner), nor are they apologetic for the security risks. At least they provided patches. It's interesting to me how deliberate some of it was. For example the statement "If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers." but honestly, how many system admins know about what AMT is and/or know they can do something about it? So basically what they're saying is "despite that we [should have] known about this 'bug' for nearly a decade, we never told users to provision AMT nor supplied a patch to Windows to do it for you". They basically intentionally left it alone. This of course is assuming they're lying about just recently discovering this, but I've heard people complaining about the security flaws and backdoors of the Core i series a very long time ago.

I don't know exactly when this was implemented relative to Obama's inauguration, but whether Obama wanted/approved of this or not, the timing of the implementation would've been way too quick. The checks and balances of the government alone would have made the process take up too much time, but you also have to consider Intel's software and hardware engineers had to design and create these features. Together, I'm sure that likely would've taken at least a year to accomplish. However, I wouldn't be surprised if Obama was aware of this "bug", and, I don't think the ending of his presidency is related to this either. Just to clarify, I'm not being a tinfoil hat here, just speculating - I honestly couldn't care less if the CIA or NSA wants to spy on me. mieciu184 Newbie Posts: 2 Joined: 2017-05-02 #5427164 Posted on: 05/02/2017 04:32 PM Took em 9 years to notice the bug nice Picolete Member Guru Posts: 100 Joined: 2014-12-09 #5427223 Posted on: 05/02/2017 06:24 PM Quote: Originally Posted by mieciu184 took em 9 years to notice the bug nice :d "bug" Turanis Maha Guru Posts: 1037 Joined: 2014-08-15 #5427227 Posted on: 05/02/2017 06:37 PM At least!

Mark GurmanDina Bass Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco/Seattle: Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. ALSO READ : Microsoft launches $999 laptop in hardware push to college students During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfibre that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colours, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.” The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don’t let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available 15 June, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Bloomberg Mark GurmanDina Bass Topics: Microsoft Laptop Surface Laptop college students Apple More From Livemint READ MORE SAT admits Reliance Industries’ plea against Sebi ban Populism is great for stock buyers ‘Baahubali 2’ dominates cinemas in April First Published: Tue, May 02 2017. 11 05 PM IST Editor's Picks SoftBank takes Snapdeal closer to Flipkart sale but yet to seal terms Madhya Pradesh decides to change to January-December fiscal year Infosys to hire 10,000 US workers after Donald Trump targets H1B visas Latest News SAT admits Reliance Industries’ plea against Sebi ban Populism is great for stock buyers ‘Baahubali 2’ dominates cinemas in April Why Netflix is winning the online piracy wars Global gold prices near three-week low on higher risk appetite as US Fed meets Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

Travis Pope05/02/2017 There was a time when almost no one seriously competed with Apple’s MacBook line of laptops. The machines were too well designed for cheaper Windows laptops to compete against. Even those that matched its price and offered improved hardware couldn’t match its sales. The Surface Laptop, Microsoft’s newly announced Windows 10 PC, will take the battle to Apple this summer. The Surface Laptop hopes to become the college status symbol that the MacBook Air has been by offering long battery life and a thin profile that’s easy to stuff into a bag. Microsoft is also hoping that its compatibility with some Surface accessories and Microsoft software will make it the obvious choice for students. The Microsoft Surface Laptop. Read: Surface Laptop Release Date, Pre-Orders & Features How does the Surface Laptop compare to the MacBook Air? Which should students buy when the summer arrives and they’re looking for their university laptop? You’ll be surprised how easy this decision is. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Internals The Surface Laptop is made of up Aluminum. That’s the same material that previous devices in the Surface line-up have used. Microsoft mixed its Surface Book design with the way a Surface Pro 4 looks when paired with a cover. The lid and body are made of metal, but the keyboard deck is covered in the Alcantara fabric that is also used for the Surface Signature Type Cover. The device comes in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt and Gold, depending on which model you order. Read: 6 Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards They each weigh 2.76 pounds. They are only.57-inches thick from top to bottom. Its 13.5-inch display has a resolution of 2256 x 1504 pixels. It also uses the Intel HD 620 graphics in its least expensive model. Upgraded versions use Intel Iris Plus 640 technology. It was the MacBook Air that ushered in the era of ultra-thin laptops. Which is why it’s ironic that it measures 0.68 inches from top to bottom. It’s thicker than Surface Laptop. It has the same all Aluminum design that it started out with. It weighs 2.96 pounds, which is slightly more than the new Surface Laptop. MacBook Air 2015 The MacBook Air’s 13.3-inch display has a resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels. Videos will be less crisp on the Air than the Surface Laptop. There’s no touch experience because it’d be wasted on the Air if there was a touchscreen. MacOS isn’t made for anything but a mouse and keyboard. The entry-level models come with a 1.6GHz Dual-Core processor and 8GB of RAM DDR3 RAM. An option lets you add Intel’s 2.2GHz Core i7 processor but no additional RAM. Read: 2015 MacBook Air Release Retina vs MacBook Air: 5 Exciting Details The MacBook Air and Surface Laptop both cost a minimum of $999, and if the MacBook Air sounds underpowered compared to the Surface Laptop is because it is. Microsoft is attempting to go after a huge weak spot in Apple’s line-up. Rather than refresh the MacBook Air, Apple has focused on dropping ports and slimming down the mainline New MacBook. The only thing that makes Microsoft’s comparisons to the MacBook Air fair is Apple’s refusal to drop the price of the slimmer MacBook and its continual sale for $999 on the company’s website and in stores. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Features The MacBook Air is the last Apple mobile computer to offer a MagSafe 2 power plug. It’s one of the few that offers two USB 3.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 2 port and a headset jack too. The current mainstream New MacBook dumps all that for a single USB Type-C port instead. The SDXC card slot allows the MacBook to pull video and photos off cameras without attaching a cable or hub. The trackpad uses Apple’s multi-touch technology to emulate some of the same gestures you’d use on an iPad to navigate and browser. The Surface Laptop features a full multi-touch display, meaning it can detect 10 different points of input. The company has also gone and added support for its other Surface accessories. Surface Dial lets you manipulate apps and programs naturally. Surface Pen lets you write in your apps, and the Surface Connect port is for docking and charging. There’s a Mini DisplayPort, a headset jack, and a full-size USB 3.0 port. You can sign into the laptop using the front-facing Windows Hello camera that the Surface Pro 4 pioneered. The MacBook Air runs the latest version of MacOS, while the Surface Laptop will run a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 S. Windows 10 S is just like the regular version of Windows 10 except that you have to get all your apps and programs from the Windows Store. That means no Chrome and no iTunes unless the companies that make those programs decides to bring them to the Windows Store or you upgrade the operating system. For the first year, Microsoft will upgrade Surface Laptop buyers to a version of Windows 10 without this limitation for free. The company will throw in a subscription to Office 365 too. After the free period, upgrading to Windows 10 Pro will cost Surface Laptop buyers $50. It’s worth noting that Apple gives away its iWork suite of apps to all buyers. That offer doesn’t expire and neither do the apps. The MacBook Air lasts 12 hours between charges. The Surface Laptop lasts 14 hours. There’s something that Microsoft can’t best with hardware alone that the MacBook Air has to its credit: the iPhone and iPad. Both are so successful that you may have one already. The services and iTunes content that’s available on your iPhone can be loaded into Windows 10 with iTunes. However, Surface Laptop can’t replicate how easy it is to switch tasks or reply to messages on your iPhone with a MacBook Air. Surface Laptop vs MacBook Air: Which Should You Buy? The MacBook Air is the original thin-and-light notebook. It arrived even before the original Surface devices did. Steve Jobs revealed the notebook by pulling it out of an inter-office envelope. Its days are numbered though, and even Microsoft knows it. For the same price as the MacBook Air you can get a Surface Laptop with a modern processor, modern design and modern integrated graphics, thinner profile, lighter chassis and more battery life. The 4GB of RAM in the entry Surface Laptop is clearly a misstep that users will have to decide if they’re okay with. So is the use of Windows 10 S instead of Windows 10 Home. After 2017, users won’t be happy that they have to pay Microsoft to do something that has been free in existing versions of Windows that they’ve used. Look into the Surface Laptop, if you’d planned for an upcoming MacBook Air purchase to be your first foray into Apple’s hardware. The Surface Laptop may have enough advantages to keep you from leaving. If you love MacOS already, you should consider the New MacBook. It’s a bit more expensive, but you’ll all the latest features Apple’s offers. At this point, the MacBoo Air is a bit old. The Surface Laptop arrives on store shelves June 15th. You can place a pre-order now from the Microsoft Store. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

The Surface lineup has always been about offering something unique on the computing landscape, with the Surface RT offering the first kickstand on a notebook, and the Surface Book offered a detachable GPU base. The quality of the products has improved very quickly over the last five years too, and with the Surface Studio, Microsoft is now offering one the best displays available to anyone in any device, and Surface Pro 4 is easily one of the best devices in its category (which it created). But today they’ve taken a different turn. Today Microsoft is announcing the Surface Laptop. There’s no kickstand, no detachable display, no ability to fold it into a drafting table. There’s no fancy trick at all with the Surface Laptop. Microsoft just decided to finally build the one product that people were hoping they would build, and if it’s executed like most of their products, it should be a pretty strong offering compared to the competition. Although we were unable to attend the launch event in NYC today, let’s dig into what we do know about this to see how close they’ve come to the mark. With most of their products, they have tried to introduce a new category of computing, but with the Surface Laptop, there is an already large group of Ultrabooks to compete against. Microsoft Surface Laptop Processor Intel Core i5-7200U 2C/4T 2.5-3.1 GHz 15W TDP Intel Core i7-7660U 2C/4T 2.5-4.0 GHz 64MB eDRAM 15W TDP Memory 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB Dual-Channel LPDDR3-1866 Graphics Intel Core i5-7200U Intel HD 620 (24 EUs, 300-1000 MHz) Intel Core i7-7660U Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (48 EUs, 64 MB eDRAM, 300-1100 MHz) Display 13.5" 2256x1504 3:2 PixelSense Touch and Pen support 100% sRGB color, individually calibrated panels Storage 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB PCIe NVMe Networking Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC (802.11ac, 2x2:2, 866Mpbs Max, 2.4 and 5GHz) Bluetooth 4.0 Audio OmniSonic stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium Dolby Audio Battery "Up to 14.5 hours video playback" 44W A/C Adapter with 5 Watt USB port Right Side Surface Connect Port (charging and docking) Left Side USB 3.0 Full Size mini DisplayPort Headset Jack Dimensions 308.02 x 223.2 x 9.93-14.47 mm (12.1 x 8.8 x 0.39-0.57 inches) Weight 1.25 kg (2.76 lbs) Cameras Front: 720p with Windows Hello support Pricing 128 GB Intel Core i5 with 4GB of RAM: $999 256 GB Intel Core i5 with 8GB of RAM: $1299 256 GB Intel Core i7 with 8GB of RAM: $1599 512 GB Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM: $2199 Starting with the display seems to be a great jump-off point, since Microsoft, more than any other OEM, has been pushing displays as a focal point, and it is again in the Surface Laptop. It features a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, in the now common aspect ratio for Surface of 3:2. Microsoft touts its devices as productivity machines, and the 3:2 aspect ratio helps a lot there. For those with good memories, the Surface Laptop’s display is the same size as the Surface Book, but it is not the same display. The display density is lower than both the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, which both feature 267 pixels per inch. Likely in an effort to lower costs, and increase battery life, Microsoft has chosen a 2256 x 1504 resolution for the Surface Laptop, which works out to 3.4 million pixels, and 201 pixels per inch. As with all Surface devices, the display supports 10-point multitouch, and it can be used with a Surface Pen. Microsoft also claims 100% sRGB coverage, with individually calibrated displays. They lead the industry here, and are one of the only PC makers that offer calibrated displays across all their devices now, with perhaps the exception of Apple. Despite the lowered resolution, the excellent aspect ratio and color calibration should still make this a solid display for day to day use. Powering the Surface Laptop is an Intel Kaby Lake processor, with either the Core i5-7200U, or the Core i7-7660U. The Core i5 is along the same lines as what everyone is offering in an i5, but the Core i7 is a nice step up, featuring Intel’s Iris Plus Graphics 640. This is a handful of a name, this is the GT3e version of Intel’s latest integrated GPU, featuring twice the execution units of the normal HD 620, and it features 64 MB of eDRAM as well, so the overall processor should be faster for most tasks. It’s nice to see the Iris available, as it is in the Surface Pro 4 i7 as well. Memory starts at a mere 4 GB for the base model, but there will be 8 GB and 16 GB models as well. The Surface Laptop is leveraging LPDDR3 memory, so 16 GB will be the maximum. Storage is 128/256/512/1024 GB SSDs, as you’d expect in an Ultrabook. One of the more interesting aspects of the Surface Laptop is the keyboard and trackpad. The trackpad is the same trackpad as the Surface Book, which is probably the best trackpad in the PC space right now, so that’s a good thing, and the Surface Book keyboard is also excellent, so expectations for the Surface Laptop are that it will match the Surface Book in these regards, however Microsoft has chosen to outfit the Surface Laptop with an Alcantara keyboard deck. This is a synthetic fabric, and they’ve used it before in a special edition version of the Surface Pro keyboard, as well as the Surface Ergonomic keyboard. Although it’s fabric, it is coated in a anti-spill coating, so liquids should bead off of it if it does get wet. It does have a great feel to it, assuming it’s similar to the other Surface products, so this should be a nice addition. Like most Surface devices, it features a Windows Hello IR camera, allowing for facial recognition login, along with a 720p web cam. It would have been nice to see a 1080p camera here, but it should be adequate. The Surface Laptop also features a TPM 2.0 chip which should make it suitable for the enterprise. Microsoft is also showing off “OmniSonic” stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium, so in theory the sound quality should be ok, but with laptops the bar is always pretty low. The one real omission on the Surface Laptop is in expandability. It features the SurfaceConnect port, for charging, just like the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, and Microsoft does sell a dock for this too. There is also a full-sized USB 3.0 port, and a mini DisplayPort. The one major omission is USB-C, which seems to be the port that Microsoft refuses to support. USB-C was around when they launched the Surface 3 back in April 2015, but they chose to charge it over micro USB, to its detriment. When they launched the Skylake powered Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 were available, but somewhat niche. In May 2017 though, USB-C should be on everything. The amazing thing is that they used the space for USB-C to offer a mini DisplayPort, when USB-C could do DisplayPort over its alternate modes. I have no problem with them keeping the SurfaceConnect port, but not offering USB-C at all, let alone Thunderbolt 3, seems like a missed opportunity. I agree the full sized USB 3.0 port is likely what most people would need right now, but a small bit of futureproofing with USB-C would not have killed them. So that’s the hardware out of the way. Microsoft has been using Surface devices to push their software since Surface was first announced with Windows 8, and that hasn’t changed with the Surface Laptop. It will feature a new Windows version called Windows 10 S. We’ll get into Windows 10 S in another piece, but the basics are that it’s a version of Windows 10 which will only work with apps in the Windows Store. Sound familiar? Of course it does, since Windows RT had the same restriction. The difference between then and now is significant though. When Windows RT launched, the Store was an empty wasteland, and Microsoft never got the developer buy-in that they had hoped for. With Windows 10, the major difference is that Microsoft offers a Desktop bridge, allowing companies to bring their Win32 apps to the store relatively unmodified. So despite not being able to run apps from outside the Windows Store, you will still have access to Microsoft Office, and apps like Adobe Photoshop Elements. In many ways, the Store versions of these apps are superior to the legacy implementations, with much easier install and uninstall, and a more robust security model. But for those that need to install apps from outside the Windows Store, Windows 10 S can be unlocked to Windows 10 Pro, and on the Surface Laptop, that unlock will be free for the first year. The new Surface Laptop is going to be available in four colors in the USA, with Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. Outside the USA, only one color will be offered initially, but the others should follow soon. And then there is the price. Microsoft is being fairly competitive with the pricing, with the Surface Laptop starting at $999 USD for the base 4 GB / 128 GB / i5 model. That’s a strong starting price for a premium Ultrabook, although the RAM limitations will make it unappealing to many. For $1299, the i5 model bumps up to 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD, which is more in the sweet spot. The i7 model with Intel’s Iris graphics starts at $1599 with the same 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, and jumps to $2199 for the 16 GB / 512 GB model. Although the prices are high, the price comparisons to the competition are not that far off, meaning Microsoft likely didn’t make any friends with their OEMs today. The new Surface Laptop is available for pre-order now, with shipments starting in June. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

How utterly f*ing boring and disappointing. All 3 previous "Surface" devices have been interesting and cool, even if the Surface Studio was a niche thing for artists it still did its job really well. This is just another laptop with absolutely zero to distinguish it from any other. Bleh. Reply Hubb1e - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link It's the 4GB of ram that is frankly ridiculous. Remember that a large portion of that is used for video memory on the iGPU. Reply nagi603 - Wednesday, May 03, 2017 - link yea, a $1k laptop should not have 4 gigs, that's a joke. Just get an XPS 13/15, much more sensible choice, and you're not even limited to w10, crappy, hamstrung and never updated MS drivers and design problems. I certainly was happy to throw my Surface Pro 2 away... Reply ddriver - Wednesday, May 03, 2017 - link Hey, being designed by a lousy producer of spyware comes at a price premium. Besides its "for students" you know, them poor souls who have to be sunken into debt for life to afford "prestigious" education. What's a couple more grands for a "prestigious" device to go along. I wonder about pen support, it seems pretty much pointless unless it can do "tablet mode". Reply Wineohe - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Yeh. 4GB? They can't be serious. As for Windows 10S? Hmmm. I've resisted switching to Apple, but Microsoft is giving justification for a switch. If you are going to ape someone else's strategy you need to be better, but I guess that is nothing new with them. 10S is a non starter, so does this mean they are working toward a subscription? I'm not sure why I am trolling this anyway, since I've been shopping the XPS 15. Reply Alexvrb - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Free upgrade to Pro on the Surface Laptop. Right there in the article. They just want people to try Win S with it's fast boot and instant resume. Anyway, yes, the base model should have been 128GB SSD with 8GB of RAM. Not 4. That's my only gripe, outside of the pricing in general - but it's a premium-build flagship like all of the other high-end Surface devices. Not a surprise. Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link When did 200 DPI become low res? Reply lilmoe - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link It should be pretty darn apparent for all of you, by looking at the latest products targeting this particular segment of the market, that specs mean nothing. Design, brand and overall and the overall package is everything. Consumers of this segment worry more about the keyboard, screen, light weight, colors and simplicity (clean design) of the device. If you nail all of these, then you're golden. If they went with better specs, then it's going to create more confusion for the intended market. This is for the consumer that doesn't want all the bells and whistles of previous Service offerings. Would I buy one? Heck no. Does it appeal to me? Not in the slightest. Would it my wife want one for her home office? Most probably yes. Reply Alexvrb - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link You nailed it. They're not going after spec hounds, techies, or gamers. I sure as heck wouldn't spend that kind of coin on something so mild. But I know I'm not the target audience, and I can respect the reasons someone might want one, to a degree. They are really premium devices, I can see a lot of business users wanting one.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home Network Office Server Software System Tools Workstation Home / Professional / Intel stamps out nine year-old security bug Intel stamps out nine year-old security bug Paul Taylor 8 hours ago Professional, Security, Software, Software & Gaming, Tech News In a classic case of “better late than never” Intel has informed customers it has finally eradicated its INTEL-SA-00075 bug and provided a set of tools to diagnose, mitigate and/or resolve the issue. From Nehalem to Kaby Lake, every Intel CPU built since the introduction of the Core microarchitecture has been plagued with a security bug which allowed unprivileged network attackers to remotely gain system privileges to computers operating under Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), usually used in corporate environments to remotely manage your IT assets. The bug relates to a flaw in the Management Engine and while one may think they are impervious because they have the latest patches on their PC, one should check again. Also, you needn’t operate a PC provisioned with AMT or ISM in a business environment to be vulnerable, it seems, you are still vulnerable within a local network. While most machines will be updated via the OEM’s firmware patches, the bug goes back long enough for you to do your own patching as the computer may have reached its end of support. If that is the case, head on down to Intel’s download center and follow the instructions. If you haven’t found a specific patch for your PC, you can run Intel’s vulnerability detection tool or simply nerf the necessary processes running in the background by following the instructions in Intel’s Mitigation Guide. The bug discovery was attributed to Maksim Malyutin from Embedi, although we are aware that Charlie Demerjian over at Semiaccurate has been raging about it for years now, and with good reason. KitGuru Says: While there have been no notable public incidents attributed to this bug, it seems a would-be attacker would have full access to machines operating under the bug. That is downright scary, considering it affects every Intel Core-based machine built in the last 9 years.   Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Intel news Privilege Escalation SA-00076 Security bug Previous Nokia 8 confirmed, available on pre-order… if you’re in India Check Also Alleged Skylake-EP on sale at eBay If you want to get your hands on some prime Intel server rib, then you … Gabriel Evans I commenced freelancing over net, by doing some fundamental tasks which actually desired a pc and having access to broadband and consequently I am more happy than ever… 6 months have passed by ever since i began this furthermore i received a residual income full amount of of 36,000 dollars… Usually I earn eighty dollars each hour and work for three to four hours nearly all of the days.And great advantage of this is that you can keep control of time while you work and for how long as you like and you achieve a take-home pay every week. —->>>LEARN MORE Regarding It here-> GET.LC/3EBeI dfdfsds Polls Does your main rig have an M.2 slot?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Intel Corporation Makes a Smart Move In about a month, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is expected to roll out its next-generation processor family for high-end desktops, known as Skylake-X. The chips will, per a recent leak from the generally reliable BenchLife.info , feature between six and 12 processor cores, have improved processor cores compared to the current Broadwell-E parts that Intel is selling in this market, and be manufactured in the company’s new 14-nanometer-plus technology. All in all, it looks like Intel is preparing some interesting chips that, along with a new platform known as X299, should be interesting to desktop enthusiasts, prosumers, and even gamers. Image source: Intel. As I examined the BenchLife.info leak more closely, I noticed something interesting. The leaked Intel documents appear to refer to these chips as „Core X-Series” chips, rather than the standard Core i7 that we would expect from Intel’s high-end desktop lineup. What this signals to me, then, is that Intel is going to try to build a gaming/enthusiast-centric brand — clearly called Core X — that’s branded distinctly from its processors targeted at more mass-market personal computers. This is a smart move. Here’s why. The importance of branding and marketing There’s a reason a company like Intel employs many marketing professionals and spends lavishly on marketing campaigns each year (Intel’s marketing, general, and administrative, or MG&A, expenses in 2016 were about $8.4 billion) — it takes a lot of effort to sell products to customers. One of the things Intel has focused on for a while now is trying to extract as much profitability as possible from its personal computer chip business. Profitability is determined by both chip average selling prices as well as chip manufacturing costs. Ideally, a company will minimize the latter while maximizing the former. Although marketing can’t do much to improve chip manufacturing costs once the product is defined and built, it can have substantial influence on product average selling prices. A key way Intel has said it’s trying to boost profitability in its personal computer chip business is through aggressive product segmentation. What this means is that Intel builds products at each price point with cost structures and feature-sets commensurate with those price points. That way, if customers buy lower-priced chips, the absolute revenue and margin dollars are lower, but the gross margin percentage is as high as it can reasonably be. At the same time, though, critical to an effective segmentation strategy is giving customers reasons to stretch their budgets a little more to buy higher-priced processors. The average consumer doesn’t care about the technical speeds and feeds of a computer or the processor inside of it, but she or he can easily understand that a computer with a Core i7 chip will be faster/better than a similar computer with a Core i5 or Core i3. Additionally, Intel isn’t the only player that’s interested in getting customers to buy more feature-rich products — the computer vendors, too, want to give customers incentive to buy higher-priced computers. So, what you will typically see is that system vendors will pair lower-end processors with commensurately lower-end computers, and higher-end processors with higher-end computers. If this strategy is successful, Intel and its partners win. Tying this back to Core X Right now, Intel’s segmentation strategy works well when we’re talking about standard consumer and business personal computers. However, Intel doesn’t really have a good segmentation strategy in the gaming market today. Intel’s high-end desktop processors are also branded Core i7, as are the company’s unlocked „K”-series processors targeted at gamers (there are Core i5 and i3 variants of the „K” chips, too). By building a separate Core X product line (and potentially segmenting within that line, e.g., Core X5, Core X7, and Core X9), Intel and its partners not only have an easier time getting customers to buy Core X-based systems if they’re interested in gaming (it will be easy to train sales reps at big-box stores to direct individuals looking for gaming computers to Core X-based systems), but Intel would also be able to effectively segment within the already higher-end Core X line. The net effect of this, if Intel is successful, should be a boost in processor average selling prices (a win for Intel) and gaming-computer average selling prices (a win for Intel’s partners). 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Elyse Betters2 May 2017Laptops Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Microsoft has introduced a new Surface-branded device - and it runs a new version of Windows 10. Called Surface Laptop, it's a premium device designed to rival the 12-inch MacBook. So, with that in mind, we pitted the Surface Laptop against the MacBook as well as the 13-inch MacBook Pro -- because why not? If you're considering the Surface Laptop, you're probably also eyeing both of Apple's compact laptops. But which one is best for you and your lifestyle? Well, we've figured it so you don't have to. Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Design Surface Laptop: Metal, plastic, and fabric body available in different colours MacBook: Aluminium construction available in four different colours MacBook Pro: Aluminium construction with OLED Touch Bar Microsoft's Surface Laptop is available in four colours (burgundy, platinum, cobalt blue, and graphite gold). Its emphasis is on manufacturing skill, with metal, plastic, and the Alcantara fabric deck coming together to give you a premium product. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, full-size USB 3.0 port, and Surface Connect for extendibility. It weighs 2.76 pounds with the following dimensions: 12.13 x 8.79 x 0.57 inches. Apple's 12-inch MacBook has a "highly recyclable aluminum enclosure" available in rose gold, space gray, gold, and silver colours. The MacBook only comes with a USB Type-C connection for power and external use. However, many third-party accessories and dongles are now available. It weighs 2.03 pounds and has a tapered thickness with the following dimensions: 11.04 x 7.74 x 0.14-0.52 inches. Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro introduces a Touch Bar OLED panel, which replaces the function keys on the keyboard. They dynamically change depending on what you're doing. There's also Touch ID in the power button, allowing for Apple Pay and logging in. It comes with come with two USB Type-C connections and weighs 3.02 pounds with the following dimensions: 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches. In terms of size, the Surface Laptop is thicker and heavier than the 12-inch MacBook but not the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It also has as many colour options as the 12-inch MacBook, and although it doesn't have an aluminium unibody construction, it does have a premium blend of materials. All three laptops offer a 3.5mm headset jack and at least some way for you to hook up external peripherals. Here's how much the new MacBook Pro will cost you in new adapters and cables Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Display Surface Laptop: 13.5-inch, 2256 x 1504 pixels, 201ppi, touchscreen MacBook: 12-inch, 2305 x 1440 pixels, 226ppi MacBook Pro: 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1600 pixels, 227ppi The Surface Laptop comes with a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 resolution PixelSense display (3:2 aspect ratio). It's touch-enabled with 3.4 million pixels for a sharp picture, and Microsoft is claiming it is the thinnest LCD touchscreen you'll find on any device. As it comes with touch, you also get support for Surface Pen, meaning you can craft, sketch, annotate, edit, and do whatever else you want using a stylus. The MacBook has 12-inch LED backlit display with IPS technology and a resolution of 2304 x 1440 (226ppi). Meanwhile, the MacBook Pro offers a conventional 13.3-inch Retina display with a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution (227ppi). Neither Apple laptop offers a touchscreen, though the MacBook Pro does come with a Touch Bar OLED panel on the keyboard instead of a traditional function key row. The Surface Laptop's display isn't as sharp as the 12-inch MacBook or 13-inch MacBook Pro, but it is touchscreen, which might not matter to most people, though we imagine students will love the ability to use a pen to sketch and annotate. As for which display looks better, it's difficult to judge without getting them side-by-side. We'll keep you posted when we have a chance to review the new Surface Laptop. Microsoft Surface Book i7 (2016): Not an overhaul, but certainly more oomph Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Hardware Surface Laptop and MacBook Pro offer Intel Core i5 and i7 options MacBook offers low-end Intel Core m3 or Core m5 CPUs  Surface Laptop offers Intel HD 620 or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 MacBook offers Intel HD Graphics 515 MacBook Pro offers Intel Iris Graphics 540 or Graphics 550 The Surface Laptop is powered by the latest Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs. Graphics-wise, it has Intel HD 620 or Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Impressively, Microsoft says you'll get 14.5 hours of battery life. It's also claimed that when the lid is closed and the laptop is in standby, it will drain no battery. It will be available with 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB RAM, with an option of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB SSD for storage. The 12-inch MacBook featues low-end Intel Core m3 or Core m5 CPUs with entry-level Intel HD Graphics 515, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro offers mid-range Intel Core i5 or Core i7 with Intel Iris Graphics 540 or Intel Iris Graphics 550. Both laptops promise 10 hours of battery life with casual web use and offer various RAM from 8GB to 16GB. They also both offer 256GB or 512GB of storage.  So, because the Surface Laptop runs the latest Intel silicon (Kaby Lake versus Skylake), it should theoretically outpace both Apple laptops in terms of performance as well as for  graphics, though we'd have to test the Surface Laptop first before we can make a final conclusion. It also beats both laptops when it comes to battery life, offering up nearly five hours more plus a no-draining when in standby feature. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Software Both MacBooks run the latest MacOS software Surface Laptop comes with the Windows 10 S OS Last summer, Apple pushed out MacOS Sierra with some useful new features. They can speed up how you work and find things, as well as help you save space on your precious hard drive. Perhaps the biggest new feature is Siri, which is just as useful as it is on iPhone. The new Messages app has also been revamped to make it more compatible with the all-new iOS 10 Messages app. Both MacBooks run Sierra. Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, a fully functional version of Windows that is meant to run smoothly on all hardware. The big catch is that it's designed to only run verified apps from the Windows Store. You will not be able to download apps online and install them, so this version is sandboxed. But there aren't any hardware restrictions on Windows 10 S, so again, it can run across a full range of devices. While Windows 10 S can only run verified apps from the Windows Store, you can download and run anything you want on either MacBook. That's a huge advantage. But keep in mind Microsoft is targeting students with the Surface Laptop, and it's giving them the ability to use Office apps. It's not trying to go after professionals who consistently need to use powerful apps. What is Microsoft Windows 10 S? Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Price Surface Laptop: $999 (Core i5) or $2,199 (i7) MacBook: $1,299 (256GB) MacBook Pro: $1,799 (256GB) Surface Laptop vs MacBook vs MacBook Pro: Conclusion The Surface Laptop is a real challenger to the 12-inch MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Pro. It comes with a range of ports including a 3.5mm headphone socket, USB 3.0, SD card slot, and mini DisplayPort, rather than just a USB Type-C connection, and it's available in many colours with premium finishes. It also has full, crisp touchscreen and runs the latest Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs with entry-level graphics. Plus, it's cheaper than both laptops. We'd probably say it sits somewhere between the MacBook and MacBook Pro when it comes to design, and for power, it really does give the MacBook Pro a run for its money, especially when you factor in battery life. Surface Laptop is also compatible with existing Surface accessories, like the Dial and Pen. Its "downside" is that it comes with Windows 10 S out of the box. However, you can upgrade a Windows 10 S device to Windows 10 Pro (update is $49 for individuals). This may be an attractive option if you end up needing an app that's not verified by Microsoft. And if you're using Microsoft Intune for Education to manage devices, you will be able to update your Surface Laptop to Windows 10 Pro at no cost. You have to decide what you want from your next laptop and how much you can pay. You can choose between Apple's two high-end, MacOS-powered laptops or Microsoft's high-end, Windows 10 S-powered laptop that happens to be cheaper (and is upgradeable to Windows 10 Pro). The differences aren't too wide to best honest.  Sections Microsoft Laptops Best laptops 2017: The best laptops you can buy today Which Apple MacBook is best for you?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 2, 2017 at 4:30PM In about a month, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to roll out its next-generation processor family for high-end desktops, known as Skylake-X. The chips will, per a recent leak from the generally reliable BenchLife.info, feature between six and 12 processor cores, have improved processor cores compared to the current Broadwell-E parts that Intel is selling in this market, and be manufactured in the company's new 14-nanometer-plus technology. All in all, it looks like Intel is preparing some interesting chips that, along with a new platform known as X299, should be interesting to desktop enthusiasts, prosumers, and even gamers. Image source: Intel. As I examined the BenchLife.info leak more closely, I noticed something interesting. The leaked Intel documents appear to refer to these chips as "Core X-Series" chips, rather than the standard Core i7 that we would expect from Intel's high-end desktop lineup. What this signals to me, then, is that Intel is going to try to build a gaming/enthusiast-centric brand -- clearly called Core X -- that's branded distinctly from its processors targeted at more mass-market personal computers. This is a smart move. Here's why. The importance of branding and marketing There's a reason a company like Intel employs many marketing professionals and spends lavishly on marketing campaigns each year (Intel's marketing, general, and administrative, or MG&A, expenses in 2016 were about $8.4 billion) -- it takes a lot of effort to sell products to customers. One of the things Intel has focused on for a while now is trying to extract as much profitability as possible from its personal computer chip business. Profitability is determined by both chip average selling prices as well as chip manufacturing costs. Ideally, a company will minimize the latter while maximizing the former. Although marketing can't do much to improve chip manufacturing costs once the product is defined and built, it can have substantial influence on product average selling prices. A key way Intel has said it's trying to boost profitability in its personal computer chip business is through aggressive product segmentation. What this means is that Intel builds products at each price point with cost structures and feature-sets commensurate with those price points. That way, if customers buy lower-priced chips, the absolute revenue and margin dollars are lower, but the gross margin percentage is as high as it can reasonably be. At the same time, though, critical to an effective segmentation strategy is giving customers reasons to stretch their budgets a little more to buy higher-priced processors. The average consumer doesn't care about the technical speeds and feeds of a computer or the processor inside of it, but she or he can easily understand that a computer with a Core i7 chip will be faster/better than a similar computer with a Core i5 or Core i3. Additionally, Intel isn't the only player that's interested in getting customers to buy more feature-rich products -- the computer vendors, too, want to give customers incentive to buy higher-priced computers. So, what you will typically see is that system vendors will pair lower-end processors with commensurately lower-end computers, and higher-end processors with higher-end computers. If this strategy is successful, Intel and its partners win. Tying this back to Core X Right now, Intel's segmentation strategy works well when we're talking about standard consumer and business personal computers. However, Intel doesn't really have a good segmentation strategy in the gaming market today. Intel's high-end desktop processors are also branded Core i7, as are the company's unlocked "K"-series processors targeted at gamers (there are Core i5 and i3 variants of the "K" chips, too). By building a separate Core X product line (and potentially segmenting within that line, e.g., Core X5, Core X7, and Core X9), Intel and its partners not only have an easier time getting customers to buy Core X-based systems if they're interested in gaming (it will be easy to train sales reps at big-box stores to direct individuals looking for gaming computers to Core X-based systems), but Intel would also be able to effectively segment within the already higher-end Core X line. The net effect of this, if Intel is successful, should be a boost in processor average selling prices (a win for Intel) and gaming-computer average selling prices (a win for Intel's partners).

(Bloomberg/Mark Kauzlarich) (Bloomberg) - Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market — and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience-including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype — little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices — to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.” The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don’t let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware — a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch — and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Filed under: Apple, Computer, Microsoft Print Email Gmail Related Microsoft: No Need for Laptop With Its New Tablet Microsoft: 8.1 Update Issue Limited to Surface RT Microsoft Restores Windows RT 8.1 Update Microsoft Introduces Surface 3, a Cheaper Tablet Starting at $499 Microsoft Sets Oct. 17 Release Date for Windows 8.1 More in Technology SpaceX Launches Top-Secret Spy Satellite for U.S. Government Appellate Court Won’t Reconsider Net Neutrality Ruling SpaceX Set to Launch a National Security Satellite on Sunday Hackers Exploited Word Flaw for Months While Microsoft Investigated Cassini Just Sent Back Images From its First-Ever Dive Through Saturn’s Rings OP-ED All Eyes on France Introducing the ‘New, Improved’ Hamas An Impossible Pretzel A Pashute Yid?

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Alleged Skylake-EP on sale at eBay Alleged Skylake-EP on sale at eBay Paul Taylor 10 hours ago CPU, Server, Tech News If you want to get your hands on some prime Intel server rib, then you can head along to eBay and check this matched pair of what the seller is claiming to be Skylake-EP processors, or as they describe it, an “Intel Xeon E5-2600 v5” CPU. The heatspreader is engraved with the markings “Intel Xeon P 8136” as well as the sSpec and speed rating. The “P 8136” part sounds suspiciously like the recent naming change to Xeon server parts (now tiered as Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze). Although we hadn’t heard of a P 8136, it does follow the Intel naming logic. This matched Xeon pair, claims the seller, is for the 28-core model, 2 GHz CPUs, with 38.75 MB total cache (at least 28MB of which are part of the L2 cache), and a TDP of 165W each. They can be yours for a cool $3750, each. The seller does offer full disclosure about the matched pair of CPUs, though. First off, they are not ES (engineering samples) nor QS (qualification samples) of the CPU, they are final release of a previously unreleased CPU, presumably OEM. Second, best of luck finding an LGA3647 motherboard for them. Third, the seller wants you to engage in some mild banter explaining what use you’ll give them, before selling you the CPUs, legitimately arguing he doesn’t want any returns by people who bought it and found they don’t have a motherboard to fit it on. KitGuru Says: While eBay itself shouldn’t have any issues with the sale, Intel may find it questionable if there are some agreements in place. On the other hand, conspiracy theorists might think it’s a cunning Intel ploy to gain attention.

In the wake of Intel disclosing a longstanding flaw in the remote system management features of some popular Intel chipsets, manufacturers are scrambling to release patches. It’s not an unmitigated disaster, and it affects enterprises more than consumers. But make no mistake, it’s going to take a major effort to fix. The Hack The vulnerability lies in Intel’s remote management programs that run on a dedicated microprocessor called the Management Engine. Intel says that three of its ME services—Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability—were all affected. These features are meant to let network administrators remotely manage a large number of devices, like servers and PCs. If attackers can access them improperly they potentially can manipulate the vulnerable computer as well as others on the network. And since the Management Engine is a standalone microprocessor, an attacker could exploit it without the operating system detecting anything. Intel has released a firmware patch to address the bug, and says that it hasn’t detected any exploitation. A challenge to actually resolving the problem, though, is its ubiquity. Every impacted manufacturer will have to release a tailored version of the patch, assuming the products aren’t too old to receive support. “The biggest problem is probably going to be in corporate environments, where getting access to a single machine inside the network now lets you get remote desktop access to a large number of client systems,” says Matthew Garrett, a security researcher who has been monitoring the vulnerability. “Some companies are likely to have to choose between buying new hardware, disabling a vital part of their IT management infrastructure, or leaving it vulnerable.” Who’s Affected? Some good news! A lot of Intel chipsets include the Management Engine, but only some incorporate the vulnerable remote access programs like Active Management Technology. Macs, for instance, aren’t impacted by this. And since these services aren’t turned on by default, most consumer devices shouldn’t have trouble. The search engine Shodan, which indexes internet-connected devices, shows that fewer than 6,500 potentially affected devices are visible on the open internet. Some of these could be central servers that endanger many other devices, but the numbers aren’t staggering. Other devices could also be vulnerable locally, but a hacker would need to specifically target them and have physical access. Shodan says that many of the organizations with exposed computers are universities. Intel released steps so that IT managers (or anyone) can check whether their systems are at risk. Companies like Lenovo are scrambling to push fixes. How Serious Is This? It’s not the worst, but also really not great. There are a lot of hurdles to cleaning the situation up, and in an attempt to reassure customers Intel has downplayed the issue. It says that the “vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs,” which discounts that ThinkPads, for example, can bridge the enterprise-consumer divide. Additionally, the researchers who reported the bug to Intel say that it may be exploitable on even more computers than are currently thought to be vulnerable. Since the Management Engine and related services have special system privileges and direct hardware access to begin with (appealing properties for an attacker to exploit), experts aren’t shocked to hear about this vulnerability. “A lot of people have felt a security issue in AMT was likely—and plenty of people in the security and free software communities have been talking about the dangers of the Management Engine in general for years,” Garrett says. Now that those worries have been confirmed, it’s time for system administrators and IT departments to get patching. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The company is planning huge moves in the education market, an area where Windows 10 and its existing Surface devices don’t have as strong a following as the company would like. Microsoft hopes that grades schools will purchase inexpensive laptops running its new Windows 10 S operating system. For college students and creatives, the company has something else in mind. Today it revealed the Surface Laptop. The Surface Laptop’s name describes exactly what it is. It’s a notebook that opens from the front to reveal a trackpad, keyboard and 13-inch high-resolution touchscreen display. The company is hoping that this new addition to its hardware line-up will give users that liked the looks of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 something to get excited about, all without the hardware tricks that those systems offer. Read: Microsoft Surface 2016: Everything New in 2016 The Surface Laptop could end up rivaling Apple’s MacBook and MacBook Air while providing access to the same Windows 10 S operating system that Microsoft says it has built for ease of use and speed. Surface Laptop Features Surface Laptop Release Date & Pre-Orders Surface Laptop Price Why You May Want to Wait to Buy the Surface Laptop Surface Laptop Features The Surface Laptop is both all-new and very familiar. That is, its design is fresh from the minds of Microsoft’s hardware team. First, for the things that are different. Microsoft calls this the Surface Laptop because it truly is a laptop. There are new tricks or hidden productivity modes to speak of. Its keyboard isn’t a cover like the Surface Pro 4’s is. Its base doesn’t detach from the display to reveal a thin tablet like the Surface Book does. That doesn’t mean that the Surface Laptop doesn’t take hints from other things we associate Surface with. Its body is machined from the same magnesium that Microsoft’s other devices are. The keyboard deck has an Alcantara surface and keys that match what’s available from the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover. The Surface Laptop even comes in the same colors that the existing Type Covers do. There’s a new hue too, Gold. Read: 6 Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards Even with its 13.5-inch PixelSense display and .47-inch thick chassis, Microsoft says the Surface Laptop lasts around 14 hours before needing to be charged again. The notebook weighs 2.76 pounds. Ports are minimal, there’s just a single USB 3.0 port, headset jack, Mini DisplayPort and Surface Connect port. Every Surface Laptop is compatible with the Surface Dial, Surface Pen and Surface Dock. How much power you get depends on how much you’re willing to pay. Surface Laptop Release Date & Pre-Orders Surface Laptop pre-orders are available as of today, though Microsoft isn’t launching the new laptop just yet. You can place your Surface Laptop pre-orders at the Microsoft Store ahead of the device’s June 15th launch date in the United States and some other territories. Surface Laptop Price The machine starts at $999 for a model that has 4GB of RAM, Intel HD Graphics 620 and 128GB of storage. This model only comes in Platinum. An enhanced version with the same Intel Core i5 processor as the first, 265GB of storage and 8GB of RAM costs $1,299. This upgraded version comes in Blue, Graphite, Gold, Platinum, Cobalt and Burgundy. Each has an Intel Core i5 processor inside. The second set of models using the Intel Core i7 processors and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. The first model starts at $1,599 for 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The second model has 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $2,199. Both only come in the Platinum color that Microsoft showed off today. Why You’ll Want to Buy the Surface Laptop by the End of 2017 Microsoft is betting that users want a high-end Windows-equipped alternative to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Windows devices outsell Apple devices by a wide margin, but they’ve never been able to amass the same profit and mindshare that MacBooks enjoy. Your first laptop for college helps define what type of user you are for years to come. Read: Surface Book vs MacBook Pro: Which is the Best? There’s a pretty good reason to avoid the Surface Laptop though, and it involves Microsoft’s new approach to education with Windows 10 S. The company’s partners will use Windows 10 S to create very cheap laptops for schools. Unfortunately, Windows 10 S improves performance for schools by locking out apps not downloaded from the Windows Store. You get the performances boosts and lose the ability to download Spotify or traditional versions of Microsoft Office, for example. Developers can drop their programs into the Windows Store to get around this limitation. Microsoft plans to do this with its own Office apps this summer. Photoshop is already available there. Spotify will be there soon, the company says. You want to buy your Surface Laptop before 2018 because Microsoft plans to let users get a free year of Microsoft Office 365 and an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro through the end of the year. Windows 10 Pro doesn’t have the same restrictions that Microsoft imposes on Windows 10 S. You can download apps from the store and programs from the internet. In 2018, the company will begin charging Surface Laptop buyers $50 for upgrades to Windows 10 Pro. Good luck with any Surface Laptop pre-orders that you place. By most estimates, the laptop is every bit the MacBook alternative Microsoft intended to make. Microsoft only briefly discussed the Surface Pro 4, its most successful Surface device to date. It didn’t announce any upgrades for it. 5 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 5  Boasting nine hours of battery life and a slim profile, the Huawei MateBook is relatively new to the Windows 2-in-1 space. Its maker is known best for affordable Android phones with decent build quality. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. The Huawei MateBook goes for minimalism at all costs. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch high-definition display that has a 2160 x 11440 resolution. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these come with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99.

Ask most people who the largest chip maker in the world is and they'll rightly respond "Intel." But 2017 looks likely to be the year Intel moves into second place to make way for Samsung. That prediction comes from US semiconductor market research firm IC Insights, and it's all thanks to higher pricing of memory chips. Being classed as the world's largest chipmaker comes down to money, after all. As reported by The Korea Herald, Bill McClean, president of the US research firm IC Insights, explained that "If memory market prices continue to hold or increase through the second quarter and the balance of this year, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel." With that in mind, Intel is expected to post sales of $14.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Samsung's sales are expected to top $14.6 billion. Intel first became the world's largest chipmaker back in 1993 and has held the title ever since. But as the mobile market has exploded, so did the need for the chips that make them work. Unlike on PC where Intel dominates, mobile is a different matter entirely, and Samsung is on hand to provide the DRAM and NAND chips they require. Related MSI Bundles Intel Optane Memory With Motherboards MSI Bundles Intel Optane Memory With Motherboards As to why memory prices have increased and may continue to do so, we have China to thank for that. More Chinese consumers are buying high-end devices, all of which require memory chips to function. Samsung wins on two fronts: it is selling more chips and the prices for them are higher. Assuming the title does change hands, whether Samsung retains it beyond the second quarter depends on what happens to memory prices. If they fall, so does Samsung back down to second position.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Going Up for Preorders Today Starting at $999, Ships June 15 By Zara Ali 14 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptop goes up for pre-ordering from today itself. The pricing for the basic variant of the Surface Laptop starts at $999, Microsoft will begin the shipments from June 15. The basic Surface Laptop variant comes with Intel® HD Graphics 620 and an Intel Core i5 Kaby Lake CPU. There is 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM onboard. On the other hand, the high-end variant comes powered by Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake CPU, 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM. There is 13.5-inch PixelSense display on both the variants. Related Microsoft Demands $49 to Change One Setting and Upgrade Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro All the variants are up for pre-ordering on Microsoft Store US website. The shipping date is more than a month away from today, which means that if you have your heart set on the new Surface Laptop, then you will have to be a little patient. The Surface lineup is Microsoft’s answer to Apple’s Mac series. Microsft’s Surface Pro 4 was pitched against Apple’s MacBook Air. Now, the $999 Surface Laptop comes up as the somewhat cheaper alternative to the $1299 MacBook. Advertisement On the software side, the Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft’s latest version of Windows 10. The Surface Laptop also features Windows Stores, similar to MacBook that has App Store as its main destination for software needs. Even though there is Windows Store for applications on Surface Laptop but users can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free until the end of this year. By upgrading, users would be able to install software from outside the Windows Store on Surface. Regarding colour options, the Surface Laptop will be available in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue and Graphite Gold. It is 14.47mm at its thickest side, 9.9mm on the thinnest, and weighs 2.76lbs that makes it easy to carry around. All said, Microsoft’s Surface business is not going hunky dory, the company is struggling to make it a success. There was 26% revenue decline in the sales, last quarter. Rising above the revenue factor, Microsoft says that it still pushing the Surface lineup so as to offer wider alternatives to the buyers against competitors like Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Security Intel Alert: Chip Maker Patches a Nine-Year-Old Security Bug Hidden in All Its Processors Since 2008 By Rafia Shaikh 12 hours ago 39Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel has published a security alert confirming that all seven generations of its Intel Core CPUs have a critical flaw. The chipmaker has been selling workstation and server chips with a flaw that could enable a remote attacker to gain complete control over the machine. The bug found in Intel’s Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology firmware versions 6.x to 11.6 gives a hacker complete access to the target machine. Shocker? This security vulnerability was live for over nine years before being fixed this week. Intel fixes a security flaw that lurked in its chips for years The Silicon manufacturing giant has apparently been shipping vulnerable products for about a decade. If your computer features a Core processor, it’s likely it could be vulnerable. However, the vulnerability only affects enterprise systems, which means if you are running Windows 7, 8 or 10 Home edition, you are likely safe. “This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs,” Intel wrote in its advisory. Related Samsung Might Become the King of Semiconductor Manufacturers in Q2, 2017 There is an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology versions firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 that can allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products.  This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs. Even if your computer shipped with Windows 10 Pro, you won’t be in any immediate danger if you haven’t enabled the AMT functionality. AMT is a management tool that allows an authorized user to remotely manage a machine, offering remote desktop experience to enterprises to manage large fleets of computers. While AMT is required to ask the user a password to give access, this nine-year-old vulnerability was capable of bypassing it. Advertisement The bug puts hundreds of millions of computers and thousands of businesses at risk as these chips are widely used in corporate machines. “The short version is that every Intel platform with AMT, ISM, and SBT from Nehalem in 2008 to Kaby Lake in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole,” Charlie Demerjian wrote in a semiconductor industry blog. “Even if your machine doesn’t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network.” Related Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Q1 2017 Quarterly Results Are Out: 66 Cents EPS On $14.8 Billion Revenue – Beats Earnings Expectation But Misses On Revenue Intel has said that it isn’t “aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability”. Users are advised to confirm if they are vulnerable by downloading this free app from Intel and proceed to apply patches as they become – hopefully – available through their device makers. “We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible,” the chipmaker said. Since this “cooperation” could take months, years or even forever to happen, the company has shared a document for mitigation in case a firmware update is not available from your OEM.

The introduction of Intel's latest Optane-based product provides an interesting play on the specification game. The claim for the latest 16GB and 32GB boards was for an endurance of 100GB/day and a TBW of 182.5TB. The JESD218B-01 standard[Ref 1] specifies and acknowledges two endurance standards: the total number of writes over the lifetime of the device in TeraByte writes (TBW), and drive writes per day (DWPD) – the latter expressed as number, not bits, bytes nor TBytes. The standard also states: “NOTE 2 The TBW rating may also be expressed in an alternative form called drive-writes-per-day (DWPD), with the assumed lifetime also stated. The value of DWPD is TBW/(C*Y*365).” As the subject is the drive, then this must be read as the lifetime of the drive or memory board, the warranty, and not necessarily the lifetime of the memory cells. The memory cell write/erase lifetime is one important means of assessing how well Intel has done with its memory cell and to provide confidence for the future of products incorporating it – especially in light of the history of phase change memory (PCM)-based devices introduced by others and then withdrawn. In this case, the memory cell is more complicated than those of the past consisting of PCM with some type of Ovonyx threshold switch (OTS) as the matrix isolation device. With two cells stacked and a number of processing options [Ref 2] and questions, as illustrated in Figure 1. At the time of the introduction of the 3DXPoint 128GB memory, now Optane, the claim was it would have endurance 1000x better than comparable Flash memory. A modern comparable Flash memory would have a w/e lifetime of somewhere between 300-1000 w/e cycles. A quick calculation for the 32GB Optane board indicates a cell lifetime of 5703w/e cycles and a DWPD of 3.125. This writer was a little taken aback by those numbers, so I asked for a third- party check on my calculation. I also asked Intel if they would confirm these calculations were correct, plus one for a Flash memory product. My calculations were confirmed by Jim Handy of Objective Analysis, who then produced a more comprehensive chart of his own, Table 1 [Ref 3], combining Intel's specification numbers with all the data that it is possible to derive from them. Importantly, Handy’s chart lists the memory cell w/e lifetimes, right hand end column. Intel's reply to my request for confirmation of the calculations was as follows: “It’s first important to note that the products you compared are vastly different products with very different use cases – Intel SSD DC P3700 is a high capacity SSD for data center usage built with NAND and Intel Optane memory is targeted at consumer desktop usage and uses 3D XPoint memory media. The usage model in both cases are very different. Messaging to analysts: People should feel comfortable with the existing CEO, let’s get behind the deputy CEO, let’s cut costs, etc. It is also important to note that Intel sets and validates endurance where it needs to be at the product level; it is not limited by media. Future products will have endurance ratings that meet the use cases for which they are developed. For example, the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X offered by Intel in an early ship program is warrantied for 30 DWPD over three years for the 375GB model. When the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB and 750GB models are broadly available later this year [they] will be warrantied at 30 DWPD for five years. The warranty and endurance ratings on these products: 1. Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X (Early Ship Program), 375GB Endurance Rating: 30 DWPD Warranty Period: 3 years 2. Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X (broad availability), 375GB and 750GB Endurance Rating: 30 DWPD Warranty Period: 5 years 3. Intel Optane Memory, 16GB and 32GB Endurance Rating: 100GB per day Warranty Period: 5 years 4. Intel SSD DC P3700, 800GB Endurance Rating: 10 DWPD Warranty Period: 5 years   Intel will not be commenting on the write erase cycles.   Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Microsoft presents $999 laptop in hardware push to college kids Microsoft Unveils New Surface Laptop Drew Angerer / Getty Images The new Microsoft Surface Laptop The new Microsoft Surface Laptop (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Mark Gurman, Dina BassBloomberg Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple's to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple's MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market-and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop's affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience-including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft's sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine's evolution, starting from the first prototype-little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices-to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team's pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. "This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team," said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay's team adhered to a "fail-fast" philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that's more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn't stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because "it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling." The designers couldn't poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many "anechoic" chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that's tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the "S" came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware-a selling point long touted by Apple's iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google's Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be "same on commencement day as it is on graduation day." (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won't be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft's app store. "Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft," Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch-and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn't had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team "created what we know our customers are asking for." Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple's OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft's first real laptop. "In the end," he said, "it's going to appeal to everyone."

Check out the detailed stats for: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Terrie Colard May 2, 2017 0 Comment INTC, Intel Corporation, NASDAQ, Semiconductor - Broad Line, Technology Overview: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), from Technology sector has been doing well recently. Intel Corporation has been operating with a total market capitalizations of 177.36 B and has reported a price of 36.31 today, highlighting a positive change of 0.44%. The average volume stands at 23833.58 for Intel Corporation. Performance: The performance week for Intel Corporation is at -1.20% while the performance month is at 1.57%. The quarterly and half-yearly performance stats are -2.27% and 5.85% respectively. The performance (Year to Date) is currently at 0.82%. The current operating margin for Intel Corporation is at 23.40%. The return on assets for Intel Corporation stands at 10.00%, (ROA – calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the company’s total assets –  illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets). The dividend yield stands at 3.00% while the payout ratio is 43.80%. At present the return on equity (ROE) stands at 17.40% and the debt to equity is at 0.39. Technical: Intel Corporation’s 52-week high is currently at -4.89% and the 52-weel low is at 25.85%. The simple 20 day moving average stands at 0.44% and the simple 200-day moving average is at 1.96%. A simple definition of the simple moving average: The simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the ‘noise’ by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. The earnings per share growth rate for this year stands at -9.30% and 3.93% for the coming year.

According to new research from IC Insights, should Intel perform to the middle of the range outlined by the team for the quarter, Samsung would only have to improve sales by 7.5% to climb to the top of the table. It is still a massive ‘if’ at the moment, but numerous suppliers have tried to topple the dominance of Intel over the years with none succeeding; it could be quite a milestone in the rock and roll semiconductor space. “Samsung’s big increase in sales has been driven by an amazing rise in DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices,” the team wrote on their blog. “IC Insights expects that the tremendous gains in DRAM and NAND flash pricing experienced through 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017 will begin to cool in the second half of the year, but there remains solid upside potential to IC Insights’ current forecast of 39% growth for the 2017 DRAM market and 25% growth in the NAND flash market.” Intel has been firmly set in number one position since the early 90s as it created a market dominance in the fast-growing PC market. While numerous competitors have trimmed the gap, none have succeeded in usurping the giant, however this could be set to change. Should memory chips maintain current pricing levels, there is every opportunity for Samsung to lead the charge. Both are heading towards $60 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales so it will be a tight race. It would not be the first time Samsung have sprung up to steal the number one market share position in a segment, but let’s just hope this time the products are a little less volatile.

Alle Posts des Autors Email: US-Korrespondent IDG News Service Alle Posts des Autors Intels neue Storage-Technologie Optane ist spätestens seit der CES 2017 in aller Munde und verspricht für Unternehmen wie Consumer zahlreiche Vorteile. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie von Optane erwarten dürfen. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Der Halbleiter-Riese Intel hat sich über die Jahre den Ruf des Geschwindigkeits-Treibers erarbeitet. Mit der neuen Speichertechnologie Optane will das Unternehmen nun noch einen Gang höher schalten. "Next big storage thing"? Dabei geht man bei Intel fest davon aus, dass Optane die heutigen SSDs im Storage-Umfeld und Hauptspeicher auf DRAM-Basis ersetzen wird. Eine Vorstellung, die in vielerlei Hinsicht verlockend ist: nicht nur was die Boot-Geschwindigkeit und Produktivität ganz allgemein angeht, sondern auch in Sachen Gaming. All diese Bereiche dürften durch Optane einen wesentlichen Performance-Boost erhalten. Ganz konkret soll Optane circa zehn Mal so schnell sein wie eine konventionelle SSD. Der Beweis für diese Behauptung unter realen Bedingungen steht indes noch aus. Auf der CES 2017 wurden bereits erste Optane-Storage-Lösungen angekündigt, allerdings vorerst nur mit geringen Kapazitäten zwischen 16 GB und 32 GB, die sich lediglich als Cache nutzen lassen. Intel will mit Optane den Storage-Turbocharger zuschalten. Wir sagen Ihnen, was Sie über die neue Technologie wissen müssen. Foto: J. Lekavicius - shutterstock.com Das dürfte sich laut Pat Kannar, Marketing Director bei Dell, mit zunehmender Reife der Technologie ändern: "Höhere Kapazitäten werden in den nächsten Jahren folgen, genauso wie neue Formfaktoren". Bis dahin, so der Experte weiter, böten die ersten Optane-Speicher willkommenen Raum für Tests und Experimente. Auch wenn Intel also seine Technologie auf der CES präsentiert hat - Optane bleibt weiterhin ein bisschen mysteriös. Wir haben für Sie alle uns bekannten Fakten zum (potenziellen) "next big storage thing" zusammengetragen, um ein wenig Licht ins Dunkel zu bringen. Was ist Intel Optane? Optane basiert auf einer Speicherttechnologie namens "3D Xpoint". Diese zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass die Speicherzellen in eine dreidimensionale Netzstruktur eingebettet sind. Entwickelt wurde die Technologie in Kooperation mit Micron. Die ersten Optane-Produkte (16 GB und 32 GB) werden ausschließlich auf PCs laufen, die Intels neue Chipgeneration Kaby Lake an Bord haben. Skylake, Broadwell oder AMD-Chipsätze fallen in Sachen Optane also grundsätzlich aus. Letztlich wird Intel auch Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten auf den Markt bringen - mit dem Ziel, die konventionellen Solid State Disks überflüssig zu machen. Darüber hinaus wird Optane auch als DRAM-Ersatz verfügbar sein. Im Gegensatz zum dynamischen RAM ist Optane aufgrund seiner höheren Speicherdichte in der Lage, Daten auch nach dem Ausschalten eines Rechners zu behalten. Wann sind Optane-SSDs verfügbar? Laut Intel sollen erste SSDs mit Optane-Technologie zur zweiten Jahreshälfte 2017 verfügbar sein. Einige PC-Hersteller haben bereits durchblicken lassen, dass Optane-SSDs mit großen Kapazitäten noch eine ganze Weile auf sich warten lassen könnten. Es ist zudem sehr wahrscheinlich, dass diese erst einmal bei Servern zum Einsatz kommen, bevor sie ihren Weg in die Personal Computer dieser Welt finden. Derzeit testen unter anderem Facebook und IBM großvolumige Optane-SSDs in ihren Servern. Eines gleich vorweg: Wie jede neue Technologie wird auch Optane zunächst kein billiges Vergnügen darstellen. Die Optane-Storage-Lösungen entstehen derzeit in begrenzten Stückzahlen in China. Wenn die Produktion hochgefahren wird, dürften auch die Herstellungskosten sinken. SSD-Festplatten mit 480 bis 512 GB im Vergleich SSDs der 500-GB-Klasse bieten genug Platz, um ganz alleine das Betriebssystem, alle Programm und den zentralen Datenbestand zu speichern - und sind zu Preisen ab rund 150 Euro inzwischen auch bezahlbar. Wir haben für Sie die beliebtesten Varianten von 480 bis 512 Gigabyte im Vergleichs-Test. PLATZ 10: Corsair Force LX 512GB Zu den Stärken der Corsair Force LX gehören sehr hohe Datenraten und kurze Zugriffszeiten. Auch bei der Praxisleistung kann die 512-GB-SSD überzeugen. Der Lieferumfang ist hingegen dürftig und auch die Leistungsaufnahme ist durchwachsen, hier schmerzt vor allem der vergleichsweise hohe Verbrauch unter Last. Für das Gebotene ist der Preis zu hoch. PLATZ 9: Crucial MX200 500GB Beim Tempo kann die Crucial MX200 überzeugen, insbesondere die Praxisleistung und die sehr kurzen Zugriffzeiten ragen hier heraus. Weitere Pluspunkte sammelt die 500-GB-SSD durch die gute Ausstattung. Abzüge gibt es hingegen für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Für die gebotene Leistung ist die SSD preiswert, aber kein Schnäppchen. PLATZ 8: Crucial BX100 500GB Mit der BX100 bietet Crucial eine preisgünstige Solid State Drive an, die beim Tempo voll überzeugt. Positiv zu Buche schlägt auch die vergleichsweise hohe Gesamtschreibleistung von 72 Terabyte. Die Ausstattung ist hingegen durchschnittlich und auch beim Service reist das Crucial-Modell mit 36 Monaten Garantie keine Bäume aus. Minuspunkte gibt es auch für die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme. Dafür stimmt der Preis. PLATZ 7: Transcend SSD370S 512GB Mit sehr kurzen Zugriffszeiten, einer exzellenten Praxisleistung und hohen Datenraten bietet die Transcend SSD370S durch die Bank hohes Tempo. Die Ausstattung ist gut und der Stromverbrauch niedrig. Den einzigen Schnitzer, den sich das Transcend-Modell erlaubt, ist die vergleichsweise kurze Garantiezeit von 3 Jahren - die Sie aber in Relation zur exzellenten Gesamtschreibleistung sehen sollten. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. PLATZ 6: Sandisk Extreme Pro 480GB Die Sandisk Extreme Pro überzeugt mit sehr gutem Tempo in den Praxistests, konstant hohen Transferraten und flotten Zugriffszeiten. Ein fetter Pluspunkt ist die lange Garantiezeit von 10 Jahren. In Ordnung gehen die Leistungsaufnahme und der Funktionsumfang. Negativ zu Buche schlagen der mäßige Schreibbefehlsdurchsatz und der dünne Lieferumfang. Die 480-GB-Festplatte ist aktuell zu einem Straßenpreis ab 170 Euro erhältlich - das ist noch günstig. PLATZ 5: Kingston HyperX Savage SSD 480GB Die Kingston HyperX Savage 480GB ist sehr schnell, insbesondere die ausgezeichnete Praxisleistung überzeugt. Ausstattung und Lieferumfang liegen über dem Durchschnitt. Negativ zu Buche schlagen die zu hohe Leistungsaufnahme der SSD und die vergleichsweise knickrige Herstellergarantie von nur drei Jahren. Insgesamt ist die Kingston HyperX Savage aber ihr Geld wert. Wer eine flotte SSD sucht, darf zugreifen. PLATZ 4: Crucial MX100 512GB Dank 16-nm-NAND holt sich die Crucial MX100 den Titel "Energieeffizienteste SSD ihrer Klasse". Das gilt allerdings nur für die Leistungsaufnahme unter Last, im Bereitschaftszustand verbraucht die Solid State Drive mehr Energie als die Konkurrenz. Dafür besticht das 512-GB-Modell von Crucial durch schnelle Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten und hohem Befehlsdurchsatz. Ausstattung, Service und Garantiezeit sind hingegen nur Durchschnitt. PLATZ 3: Samsung SSD 850 Evo 500GB Hohe Datenraten, kurze Zugriffszeiten, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, Drive-Verschlüsselung und sehr gutes Software-Paket - die Samsung 850 Evo 500GB überzeugt in allen Testkategorien. Bei einem Straßenpreis von rund 135 Euro ist die SSD auch preislich ein sehr attraktives Angebot. PLATZ 2: OCZ Vector 180 480GB Die OCZ Vector 180 480GB besticht durch sehr hohe Geschwindigkeit, Gesamtschreibleistung und Zuverlässigkeit. Hinzu kommen die kundenfreundlichen Service-Leistungen, die sehr gute Ausstattung und der innovative Stromausfall-Schutz. Letzteren erkauft sich OCZ allerdings mit einer vergleichsweise hohen Leistungsaufnahme. Bei einem Straßenpreis von aktuell rund 190 Euro für das ist die OCZ Vector 180 bekommen Sie einen beachtlichen Gegenwert fürs Geld. PLATZ 1: Samsung SSD 850 Pro 512GB Hohes Tempo, niedrige Leistungsaufnahme, enorme Ausdauer, toller Funktionsumfang und satte 10 Jahre Garantie - die Samsung 850 Pro 512GB überzeugt auf der ganzer Linie. Kein Modell im Test bietet eine so ausbalancierte Leistung. Wäre da nicht der vergleichsweise hohe Anschaffungspreis von über 200 Euro und der maue Befehlsdurchsatz bei zufälligen Schreiben - die Solid State Drive von Samsung wäre perfekt. Bei einem aktuellen Straßenpreis von 215 Euro zahlen Sie für Samsung 850 Pro 512GB momentan 45 Cent pro Gigabyte. Ob Ihnen die Samsung-SSD den Aufpreis von rund 50 Prozent wert ist - eine gute 500-GB-SSD bekommen Sie mittlerweile schon für 135 Euro - müssen Sie selber entscheiden. Welche Systeme nutzen Optane? Viele Produkte, die auf der CES 2017 vorgestellt wurden, werden die neue Storage-Technologie an Bord haben. Zunächst wird Optane allerdings erst einmal Motherboards bereichern - in Zukunft dürfen Sie dann irgendwann ihr System mit großvolumigen Optane-SSDs "pimpen". Der erste Laptop, der optional auch Intels Optane-Technologie mitbringt, wird Lenovos ThinkPad T570 sein. Der Grundpreis des Geräts (ca. 900 Dollar) dürfte dadurch allerdings um ein deutliches Maß nach oben schnellen. Auch HPs überarbeiteter Envy Curved All-in-One 34 wird im Frühjahr per Software-Update ebenfalls Optane-fähig gemacht, wie Mike Nash, Vice President of Product Management bei HP, auf Nachfrage verriet. Ein konkretes Release-Datum ließ er sich allerdings nicht entlocken. Auch Dell plant mit der Technologie: Verschiedene Laptops und Desktops sollen zur Jahresmitte 2017 mit Optane-Option zur Verfügung stehen. Acer Predator 21 X Acer zeigt den ersten Laptop mit einem Curved Screen. Das ist allerdings nicht das Einzige Highlight an diesem mobilen Gaming-Monster: Im Inneren werkeln gleich zwei Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Grafikkarten. Dazu gibt's einen übertaktbaren Intel Core i7-Prozessor, 64 GB DDR4 RAM und bis zu vier 512 GB SSDs. Kostenpunkt: 9000 Dollar. Acer Chromebook 11 N7 Das 11,6-Zoll Chromebook 11 N7 von Acer ist in erster Linie für den Einsatz in Bildungsinstitutionen gedacht. Deswegen ist das Teil auch kompromisslos auf Widerstandsfähigkeit getrimmt. Die Technik im Inneren ist hingegen nicht sonderlich erwähnenswert, weil ziemlich überholt. Dafür gibt’s das Teil ab Februar aber auch schon ab rund 300 Euro. Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 370 Lenovos neuestes 2-in-1-Device lässt sich dank seines 360-Grad-Scharniers jederzeit vom Laptop zum Tablet transformieren. Darüber hinaus bietet das Hybrid-Gerät die neuesten Intel-Prozessoren, bis zu 16 GB RAM und ein 13,3-Zoll-Full-HD-Display. Achja: Eine SSD mit maximal 1 TB Kapazität und einen Thunderbolt 3-Port gibt's obendrauf. HP Sprout Pro Bereits vor zwei Jahren präsentierte HP die erste Version des Sprout – damals war der AR- und VR-Hype allerdings weit weniger ausgeprägt – die Menschen brauchten keinen PC, der 3D-Objekte in digitale 2D- oder 3D-Bilder umwandeln kann. Das hat sich inzwischen grundlegend geändert. Genau der richtige Zeitpunkt also, den Sprout mit aktueller Technik „vollzustopfen“ und in Sachen Abmessungen etwas zu optimieren. Im März sollen die ersten Geräte ausgeliefert werden – zum Preis gibt es noch keine Infos. HP Envy Curved All-in-One 34 Bei vielen All-in-One-PCs werden die Hardware-Komponenten hinter dem Screen verbaut. Das ein oder andere Gerät wirkt dadurch allerdings etwas – naja, nennen wir es mal „ungelenk“. Das war bislang auch bei HPs Envy AiO der Fall. Bislang. Denn in Las Vegas zeigt HP die neue, überarbeitete Version. Die Technik (unter anderem auch die neuen Intel Kaby Lake-Prozessoren) wurde nun im Standfuß des Geräts untergebracht. Die Preise sollen bei rund 1700 Dollar starten. Asus ZenBook 3 Mit dem ZenBook 3 zeigt Asus auf der CES einen Laptop, der die neueste Technik unter der Haube hat: zum Beispiel Kaby Lake-Chips, Gorilla Glass 5 und Thunderbolt 3-Ports. Dabei ist das Gerät lediglich 12,9 Millimeter dick und etwas mehr als ein Kilo schwer. Ab Mai ist das ZenBook 3 zu Preisen ab 1700 Dollar erhältlich. Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Leidenschaftliche Smartphone-Fotografen bekommen mit dem ZenFone 3 Zoom von Asus ein neues Spielzeug. Die sonst recht unspektakuläre Technik im Inneren des Handys wird ergänzt von einem Dual-Kamerasystem, das aus zwei 12-Megapixel-Kameras besteht. An der Front sorgt eine 13-Megapixel-Kamera für hochqualitative Selfies. Das Smartphone unterstützt auch das .raw-Format und bietet vielschichtige Kamera-Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. TCL Blackberry Auch wenn die meisten Menschen die kanadische Kultmarke Blackberry längst abgeschrieben haben: TCL Communications zeigt auf der CES ein neues Smartphone. Mit mechanischer Tastatur. Die Zielsetzung des chinesischen Unternehmens ist ambitioniert: "Wir werden ein komplettes Portfolio auf die Beine stellen, um Apple und Samsung auf dem Enterprise-Markt herauszufordern", so Steve Cistulli, US-Chef von TCL. Olloclip Add-On für iPhone Die neuen Zusatz-Objektive von Olloclip sollen die fotografischen Skills von iPhone 7 und iPhone 7 Plus verbessern. Das Keyboard 5Q Sie sehen: Die weltweit erste Cloud-Tastatur. Was das bringt? Wenn bestimmte Informationen - etwa eine eingehende E-Mail - beim Keyboard ankommen, wechselt es die Farbe. So könnte man sich mehrere ressourcenfressende Browser-Tabs sparen. Neonode AirBar Bereits 2015 wurde die AirBar von Neonode erstmals angekündigt. Sein Debüt feiert das Peripheriegerät fürs MacBook Air nun auf der CES 2017. Die Airbar wird per USB an das Macbook angeschlossen und sorgt für Touchscreen-Funktionalität. Vorbestellbar ist die Airbar bereits, der Preis soll bei circa 100 Dollar liegen. Fehlt nur noch ein offizieller Termin für die Markteinführung. Armani Exchange Smartwatcheses Dass der Smartwatch-Markt rückläufig ist, scheint man beim Uhren-Giganten Fossil gelassen zu sehen: Nachdem man im letzten Jahr bereits zahlreiche schlaue Uhren namhafter Marken auf den Markt gebracht hat, folgen nun Modelle von Armani Exchange. Casio WSD-F20 Smartwatch In Las Vegas zeigt Casio die erste Smartwatch mit Android Wear 2.0. Die schlaue Uhr ist wasserdicht bis zu einer Tiefe von 50 Metern und soll auch bestens gegen Schläge und Stöße gewappnet sein. Neu ist unter anderem ein integriertes GPS. Ende April 2017 kommt die Casio Smartwatch auf den Markt, der Preis soll bei rund 500 Dollar liegen. ODG R8 & R9 Neue Mixed-Reality-Brillen aus dem Hause Osterhout Design Group wollen der Hololens zeigen, wo es lang geht: Die neuen Smartglass-Modelle R8 und R9 sind ebenfalls eigenständige Computing-Devices und unterstützen sowohl AR-, als auch VR-Apps. Dabei wiegen die smarten Brillen aber lediglich zwischen 128 und 194 Gramm und kosten bis zu 1800 Dollar. LeEco Smart Bikes Das Rad neu erfunden hat LeEco mit seinen neuen, smarten Fahrrädern zwar nicht – dafür hält jede Menge Technologie in den Fahrrädern Einzug: Navigation, Fitness-Tracking- und Kommunikations-Funktionalitäten sowie ein tracking-basierter Diebstahlschutz zeichnen die Smart Bikes aus. Ein Betriebssystem besitzen die Räder folglich auch. Nämlich BikeOS, das auf Android 6.0 basiert. Zum Preisgefüge gibt es noch keine Infos, die ersten Modelle sollen (in den USA) im zweiten Quartal 2017 erhältlich sein. Robo 3D-Drucker Die kompakten 3D-Printer von Robo verfügen über selbstjustierende Druckbetten und intuitive Touchscreens. Der Robo C2 (im Bild) ist die kleinere, leichtere Variante – wer mehr Leistung sucht, darf zum Robo R2 greifen. Reach Robotics Mekamon Die Mekamon Kampfroboter von Reach Robotics eignen sich nicht nur für ausgiebige KI-Kriege, sondern kreieren auch mit Hilfe von Augmented Reality und einem Smartphone ein immersives Single-Player-Erlebnis. Airblock Modulares Drohnenkit Aus diesem modularen Bausatz können ganz verschiedene Arten von Drohnen erstehen – etwa ein Hovercraft. In erster Linie richtet sich das Kit an Schulkinder. "Business-Kinder" dürften daran aber ebenfalls Gefallen finden. Flir Duo Wer immer schon mal eine Wärmebildkamera auf seine Drohne montieren wollte, darf ab sofort zur Flir Duo greifen. Chipolo Sticker Der Chipolo Sticker ist ein Miniatur-Bluetooth-Tracker und ideal für Menschen, die gerne Dinge verlieren. Das Device lässt sich an so gut wie allen Oberflächen anheften. Crosley Radio Vinyl Rocket Jukebox Keine Lust auf digitale Musik? Crosley Radio zeigt auf der CES den Traum aller Plattenfreaks. Die Jukebox lässt bis zu 140 Vinylplatten rotieren. Ganz ohne "moderne" Elemente geht es aber doch nicht: Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, im Inneren verrichtet ein digitaler Verstärker sein dezibelhaltiges Werk. Darüber hinaus gibt es natürlich zahllose Optionen für die Erstellung individueller Playlists. Dog & Bone Earmade System Die Wireless Earbuds von Dog & Bone lassen sich vorwärmen - für maximalen Sitz und Komfort. Sensoria Smart Socks Diese sensorbestückten Socken können unter anderem Schrittgeschwindigkeit und -Rhytmus messen und bieten GPS. In Kombination mit smarten Schuhen wird dann alles noch viel besser. HiMirror Plus Anscheinend gibt es für einen smarten Spiegel, der seinen Nutzern schonungslos jede neue Hautunreinheit und sonstige körperliche Verfehlungen unter die Nase reibt, tatsächlich einen Markt. Der Bluetooth- und WiFi-fähige HiMirror Plus tut genau das. Bis zu sechs Benutzerprofile lassen sich abspeichern – außerdem können auch die Verpackungen von Beauty-Produkten eingescannt werden, um weiterführende Informationen zu erhalten. Withings Kérastase Hair Coach Wearable-Spezialist Withings kooperiert mit der L’Oreal-Tochter Kérastase. Das Ergebnis: eine smarte Haarbürste. Das kann wahrscheinlich nur Haar-Fetischisten wirklich begeistern. Der Sinn und Zweck dahinter? Die Bürste verfügt über ein integriertes Mikrofon und zahlreiche Sensoren. Die Daten die hierbei zusammenlaufen, werden per Smartphone-App analysiert und geben Aufschluss über Haarqualität und –Beschaffenheit, die Effektivität des Kämmens und vieles mehr. Am Ende bekommt der Nutzer einen „Hair Quality Score“ und gegebenenfalls Tipps, wie sich dieser in die Höhe treiben lässt. Interessant ist dazu insbesondere die Aussage von Withings-CEO Cedric Hutchings: „Das letzte was wir wollten, war, ein simples Device in ein komplexes zu verwandeln“. Genau. FlexR Bei diesem Gadget handelt es sich um ein Stück Open-Source-Hardware, das Muskelkontraktionen maschinenlesbar macht. Das Ziel: Gamification in die Physiotherapie zu tragen. Man könnte damit aber auch Super Mario mit den Bauchmuskeln spielen. Grush Gamification-Zahnbürste Mundhygiene ist bei Kindern ja oft weniger beliebt. Damit soll nun Schluss sein – dank der smarten Zahnbürste von Grush. Denn mit Hilfe einer Smartphone-App und der Augmented-Reality-Technologie wird das Zähneputzen zum Videospiel. Kingston Data Traveler Ultimate GT Kingston zeigt in Las Vegas den bislang größten USB-Stick aller Zeiten. Die 2TB-Monstrosität besitzt nicht nur die Nomenklatur eines Sportwagens, sie bietet auch Platz für rund 70 Stunden 4K-Videomaterial. Der Preis dürfte bei circa 900 Dollar liegen. Und wer es eine Nummer kleiner mag: Ein 1TB-Modell ist ebenfalls geplant. SanDisk Extreme Pro USB-Stick Dieser USB-Stick aus dem Hause SanDisk bietet 256 GB Speicherkapazität und kommt mit USB 3.1. Damit dürfte er in Sachen Speed auf SSD-Niveau liegen. Fasetto Link Dieser unscheinbare kleine Kasten vereint LTE-Hotspot und NAS. Befeuert wird das Device von einem Samsung Exynos Octacore-Prozessor. Dazu stehen bis zu 2TB SSD-Speicher zur Verfügung. Auch Bluetooth- und USB-C-Support sind an Bord. Smarter Kühlschrank-Kamera Gadgets wie diese Smartcam zur Kühlschranküberwachung von Smarter werden oft belächelt. Aber mal ganz ehrlich: Wissen Sie immer aus dem Stegreif, was sie gerade an Lebensmitteln brauchen beziehungsweise nicht brauchen? Eben. In Zukunft genügt ein Blick aufs Smartphone, um sich Klarheit zu verschaffen. Coros Linx Smart Biking Helmet Musik auf dem Bike hören ohne Ohrstöpsel und Gefahren? Dieser smarte Fahrradhelm von Coros soll es möglich machen. Dazu nutzt das Device die Leitfähigkeit menschlicher Knochen. So bleiben die Ohren trotz Charts-Beschallung frei für Umwelteinflüsse. Gesteuert wird das Teil über eine Fernbedienung, die Augen bleiben also auf der Strasse. Das war es aber noch nicht in Sachen Sicherheit: Ein integriertes Notfall-System sorgt dafür, dass ein Alert an einen Notfallkontakt verschickt wird, sobald die Sensoren einen Aufprall wahrnehmen. Abgerundet wird das smarte Paket für Fahrrad-Freaks von einer Smartphone App mit allerlei Tracking-Möglichkeiten. Aluma Personal Safety Device Dieses Gadget tut was für die persönliche Sicherheit. Das Device von Alumi wird (beispielsweise) auf der Rückseite eines Smartphones befestigt und macht bei Aktivierung Panik bei potenziellen Angreifern, in Form eines Alarmtons der rund 135 Dezibel erreichen soll. Helle Lichtblitze und die automatische Notrufbetätigung gehören ebenfalls zum Funktionsumfang. Samsung QLED Smart TVs Bei den Smart TVs sieht es ganz ähnlich aus wie bei den Smartphones: jedes Jahr kommen unzählige neue Modelle auf den Markt - natürlich mit durchweg revolutionären Neuerungen. Genau so soll es sich laut Samsung nun auch mit der Smart-TV-Modellpalette für 2017 verhalten. Dazu hat man auch ein neues Kunstwort kreiert: QLED. Das Q steht dabei für "Quantum Dot" und soll noch schärfere, farbechtere Bilderlebnisse gewährleisten. LG OLED Smart TVs Wenn es um die OLED-Technologie geht, ist LG ohne Frage Pionier. Auf der CES zeigen die Koreaner nun ihre neue Modellfamilie. Die OLED-TVs der W-Serie zeichnen sich dabei insbesondere durch ihre „skinny“ Gehäuse aus: Das 65-Zoll-Modell ist lediglich 2,57 Millimeter dick. Sony Bravia OLED-TVs Nachdem Sony bereits seit längerem OLED-Geräte für den Profi-Einsatz anbietet, wagt man sich auf der CES erstmals auf die Consumer-Bühne. Das dürfte zwar kein günstiger Spaß werden, aber die Präsentation der neuen Highend-Smart TVs war in Sachen Bildqualität schon mal ziemlich beeindruckend. Nox Smart Sleep Light Das smarte Schlaflicht von Nox wiegt Sie mit Licht- und Musikspielen in den Schlaf. Vorher analysiert es dazu ihre "persönliche Body Clock" und kennt anschließend Ihre Schlafgewohnheiten. Die Aussendung von roten Lichtstrahlen soll die Ausschüttung des Schlafhormons Melatonin begünstigen. Petcube Bites Petcube präsentiert Bites: Eine interaktive Kamera mit Snackspender-Funktion. Für Ihr Haustier versteht sich. Vivint Sky Im Bereich Smart Home werden auf der CES wie gewohnt ebenfalls etliche Neuerungen vorgestellt. Zum Beispiel Vivints Komplettsystem namens Sky. Das soll dank Cloud-Anbindung und künstlicher Intelligenz jeglichen Konfigurationsaufwand im automatisierten Zuhause eliminieren, weil es sich automatisch an Umgebung und Bewohner anpasst. Gesteuert wird über ein iPad-eskes Controlpanel. Im zweiten Quartal 2017 soll das Sky-System verfügbar sein. Geplant sind unter anderem eine Video-Türklingel, eine Security Kamera, Sensoren für Fenster und Türen, ein smartes Thermostat und ein Smartlock. GeniCan Scanner Sogar der Mülleimer wird demnächst smart: Am "Müll-Scanner" von GeniCan können Sie die Barcodes auf den Verpackungen verbrauchter Lebensmittel scannen, um eine Instant-Einkaufsliste zu erzeugen. Samsung Family Hub 2 Auch Samsung sattelt im Bereich Hausautomatisierung weiter auf: Auf der letztjährigen CES präsentierten die Koreaner erstmals ihren smarten Kühlschrank Family Hub. Aktuell gibt es nun den Nachfolger zu sehen. Der Family Hub 2 verfügt nun über Innenkameras, die das smarte Food Management weiter verbessern sollen. Außerdem bietet der schlaue Kühlschrank nun auch Sprachausgabe für die integrierte Rezept-App. Künftig kann man sich also ganz aufs "Machen" konzentrieren. Sprachbefehle nimmt der Family Hub 2 natürlich ebenfalls gerne auf. Samsung Flexwash & Flexdry Wenn Sie eine große Familie und eine Menge Geld haben, könnte Samsungs smartes Wäscheduo Flexwash und Flexdry genau das Richtige sein. Der Clou: beide Geräte nehmen gleich zwei Ladungen Wäsche auf und lassen sich aus der Ferne per Smartphone-App steuern. "Umladen" muss man aber trotzdem noch selbst. Samsung Powerbot VR7000 Einen neuen, superflachen Staubsaugerroboter haben die Koreaner ebenfalls im CES-Gepäck. Der Powerbot VR7000 verspricht dank zahlreicher Sensoren besonders gründliche Reinigung. Gesteuert wird wie üblich per App - zudem kann der Saugroboter auch über Amazons Alexa integriert werden. Ossia Cota Bislang hieß "wireless charging" meist "Ladekissen". Das soll sich nun ändern. Diese smarte Deckenkachel von Ossia soll künftig für kabellose Power-Versorgung sämtlicher Devices sorgen. Lenovo Smart Assistant Zuwachs im Bereich der persönlichen, digitalen Assistenten: Auch Lenovo will nun mitmischen und zeigt auf der CES seinen Smart-Home-Lautsprecher. Der kann beispielsweise im Web nach Infos suchen, Musik abspielen, kalenderbasierte Erinnerungen auslösen oder Listen kreieren. Smart-Home-Geräte von Drittherstellern sollen ebenfalls unterstützt werden. LG Hub Robot Das Trendthema Smart Home hat man auch bei LG verinnerlicht: Der Hub Robot – und sein kleinerer Bruder, der Hub Robot Mini – sind Hausautomatisierungs-Hub, Roboter und persönlicher Assistent in einem. Über das Display können die KI-Genossen sowohl „Emotionen“ als auch Videos abspielen. Fortress Unified Threat Management Endlich scheint Bewegung reinzukommen, wenn es um das Thema Smart-Home-Sicherheit geht. Fortress präsentiert auf der CES sein UTM-System. Das bietet nicht nur einen großen Touchscreen für Steuerung und Konfiguration, sondern auch ein Intrusion Detection und -Prevention-System, eine Firewall und Antivirus-Software für alle über WiFi, LAN und das IoT vernetzten Devices. Außerdem steht den Kunden auch ein 24-Stunden-"Instant-Response-Service" zur Verfügung. TouchLock BLE Nie wieder Schlüssel verlieren. Oder suchen. Das verspricht dieses Smartlock von Bio-key, das via Bluetooth Low Energy mit dem Smartphone gekoppelt wird. Entsperren lässt sich das Schloss nicht nur per Passworteingabe, sondern auch über den Fingerabdruckscanner (falls vorhanden). Securifi Almond 3+ Dieser Wireless Acess Point vereint WiFi- und IoT-Funktionalität. Darüber hinaus bietet der Hersteller einen Service an, mit dem Smart-Home-Geräte vor der berüchtigten Mirai-Malware geschützt sein sollen. Bitdefender Box v2 Im April 2015 stellte Bitdefender die erste Version seiner Box vor. Zweck: Vernetzte Devices vor Hackern schützen. Die auf der CES 2017 gezeigte Box v2 kommt nun mit überarbeitetem Design und neuer Technik: ein Dualcore ARM-Prozessor und 1GB RAM sorgen für Performance. Die Box überprüft mit Hilfe von Machine Learning sämtlichen Traffic im Netzwerk und darüber hinaus, ob die Gerätschaften mit ausreichend starken Passwörtern geschützt sind. Werden Unregelmäßigkeiten bemerkt, bekommen die Nutzer einen Alert per Smartphone-App. Ecovacs Unibot Der Unibot von Ecovacs Robotics ist nicht nur Saugroboter, sondern auch Luftreiniger und -befeuchter. Darüber hinaus bemerkt der Bot dank zahlreicher Sensoren auch, wenn sich (unerwünschte) Personen im Haus aufhalten. eBlocker Um die Sicherheit geht es auch bei diesem Gerät namens eBlocker. Das Teil hängt sich in Ihr Heimnetzwerk, blockt unerwünschte Ads und versteckt die IP-Adressen sämtlicher im Netzwerk befindlicher Geräte. D-Link Smart Home Kameras D-Link zeigt in Las Vegas mehrere neue Security-Kameras fürs vernetzte Zuhause. Die zeichnen sich in erster Linie durch ein erschwingliches Preisgefüge aus und sollen laut Hersteller für eine weitere Vebreitung von vernetzten Sicherheitskameras sorgen. Ring Floodlight Cam Mit dieser Smart-Home-Security-Kamera zeigt Ring auf der CES 2017 sein bislang „aggressivstes“ Produkt in diesem Bereich: Die Kombination aus Bewegungsmelder und Kamera ermöglicht die Kommunikation mit (un)gebetenen Gästen, wirft bei Bedarf 100 Dezibel feinster Sirenenklänge in Richtung Trommelfell. Die Full-HD-Kamera deckt einen Blickwinkel von 270 Grad ab und bietet auch eine Nachtsicht-Funktion. Samsung Wisenet Smartcam A1 Samsungs Wisenet-System besteht aus jeweils einer smarten Kamera für den Innen- und Außenbereich. Maximus Security Kamera Wer etwas mehr Sicherheit benötigt, der darf mit dem "Smart Motion Security Light" von Maximus im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Licht ins Dunkel bringen. Das Device vereint Security-Kamera und Bewegungsmelder und lässt sich per App oder auch über Amazons Alexa steuern. Das integrierte Flutlicht leistet satte 2400 Lumen - genug um einen ganzen Gefängnishof auszuleuchten. TytoHome Telehealth Kit Künftig muss man wegen einer Erkältung nicht mehr zum Arzt rennen - zumindest wenn es nach TytoCare geht. Das Telehealth-Kit ermöglicht die digitale Übermittlung von Gesundheitsinformationen an den Doktor des Vertrauens. Der bekommt alle Infos in komprimierter Form - die Datenanalyse und -Übertragung übernimmt eine Smartphone-App. Zigbee DotDot Als großer Wurf für das Smart Home könnte sich die Entscheidung der ZigBee-Alliance erweisen, künftig eine einheitliche Sprache für IoT-Gerätschaften etablieren zu wollen. Diese hört auf den Namen DotDot und soll endlich dafür sorgen, dass sich Devices verschiedenster Hersteller endlich einwandfrei "verstehen". Intel Kaby Lake Chips Bereits im August 2016 hatte Intel die ersten Dualcore Kaby Lake-Chips für Notebooks enthüllt. Auf der CES kündigte der Hableiter-Riese nun ganze 40 neue Quadcore-Chips an, die für alle möglichen Zwecke (und Devices) eingesetzt werden können. Darüber hinaus unterstützen die neuen Chips auch Intels Storage-Technologie Optane. HDMI 2.1 Haben Sie gerade einen neuen Smart TV gekauft? Dann sollten Sie sich damit anfreunden, dass der schon wieder zum alten Eisen gehört. Also mehr als sonst. Denn die HDMI Licensing Group hat den neuen HDMI 2.1-Standard enthüllt. Dieser bietet nun Support für HDR, sowie 4K- und 8K-Videomaterial. Auch die neuen Audio-Codecs Dolby Atmos und DTS-X werden unterstützt. Faraday Future FF 91 Natürlich ist auch die Automotive-Branche wieder auf der CES in Las Vegas vertreten. Unter anderem Faraday Future, die einen Prototypen ihres kommenden Elektro-SUV FF 91 zeigen. Der schafft den Spurt von 0 auf 100 km/h schneller als beispielsweise ein Ferrari 458 oder das Tesla Model S. Toyota Concept-i Auch der weltgrößte Autobauer Toyota zeigt auf der CES seine Vision vom autonomen Fahren. Dabei verfolgt Toyota eine etwas andere Strategie: der Mensch soll von einem KI-Assistenten unterstützt werden. Dieser Assistent heißt im futuristischen Toyota-Konzept Yui und kommuniziert mit den Insassen zum Beispiel über Licht- und Audiosignale, aber auch über Touch. Darüber hinaus analysiert die KI auch die Aufmerksamkeit und Stimmung des Fahrers, um anschließend wertvolle Tipps zu geben. Das soll vor allem der Fahrsicherheit zu Gute kommen. Hyundai Ioniq Auch die Koreaner von Hyundai können autonom. Das beweisen sie auf der CES mit dem Ioniq. Das Fahrzeug ist in der Lage, vollständig autonom zu fahren, erkennt Lichtsignale, Kurven, andere Autos und Fußgänger über Laser-Sensoren, die die Umgebung des Autos abtasten. Die so gewonnenen Daten werden mit einer detaillierten 3D-Karte abgeglichen. Fiat Chrysler Portal Concept Fiat Chrysler zeigt auf der CES ein Concept Car namens Portal. Das soll nach Willen des Konzerns in erster Linie Millennials begeistern. Dazu bietet das Concept Car umfassende Konnektivitäts-Optionen, jede Menge flache Bildschirme und ausreichend Platz für bis zu sechs Personen. Wie bei Konzeptstudien in der Autowelt so üblich, kommt auch der Portal mit futuristischen Design-Merkmalen ums Eck. Ob diese dann beim Serienmodell umgesetzt werden können (und ob es überhaupt ein Serienmodell gibt), ist eine andere Frage. Volkswagen ID Volkswagen hat anlässlich der 50. CES eine App programmiert. Die soll den Besuchern des Messestandes ermöglichen, zu erleben "wie Mensch, Auto und Umwelt künftig im Volkswagen Ecosystem über die Volkswagen User-ID intelligent miteinander vernetzt werden." Die VW User-ID ist dabei vergleichbar mit der Apple- oder Windows-ID und ermöglicht die fahrzeugübergreifende Mitnahme persönlicher Einstellungen und Präferenzen. Intel Go Intel kündigte auf der CES seinen neuen Supercomputer für das Connected Car an. Der trägt den simplen Namen "Go", berherbergt bis zu 28 Xeon-Chips. Auch Atom- und 5G-Versionen sind geplant. Zum Einsatz kommen wird Intels Go erstmals im Rahmen eines Testlaufs in diesem Jahr. Sorgt Intel Optane für ein HDD-Revival? Klingt komisch, könnte aber tatsächlich der Fall sein - zumindest in der Anfangszeit. Die Kombination aus Optane und konventioneller HDD könnte sich aus Kostengründen lohnen, wie Pat Kannar von Dell sagt: "Ein PC mit Festplatte und Optane-Cache könnte Betriebssystem und Applikationen schneller laden als ein System, das ausschließlich auf SSDs setzt. Dazu müsste ein Image des OS und der Applikationen im Optane-Cache abgelegt werden. Das dürfte in einigen Fällen vor allen Dingen billiger als ein reines SSD-System sein." Die Kombination aus Optane-Cache und SSD-Hauptspeicher ist im Vergleich natürlich noch einmal wesentlich schneller, aber eben auch wesentlich teurer. 1968 - 2000: U-matic Bevor die VHS-Kassetten ihren Siegeszug antreten, entwickelt Sony bereits Ende der 1960er Jahre das erste Videokassetten-System namens U-Matic. In erster Linie für den Business-Markt gedacht, etablieren Sony, Panasonic und JVC U-Matic ab 1971 auch auf dem Consumer-Markt, wo es zunächst mit dem VCR-System von Grundig und Philips konkurriert. Erhältlich sind die U-Matic-Bänder in einem kompakten (und weit verbreiteten) Format mit 20 Minuten Laufzeit und als Standard-Kassetten mit bis zu 75 Minuten Laufzeit. Auch wenn U-Matic sich aufgrund der fehlenden Consumer-Akzeptanz letztlich nicht gegen VHS durchsetzen kann, bleibt das System vor allem in der Kreativ- und Medienbranche im Einsatz, bevor es Ende der 1980er vielerorts von Betacam SP abgelöst wird. 1970 - 1978: Television Electronic Disc Die beiden deutschen Elektronik-Konzerne Telefunken und Teldec schließen sich Anfang der 1970er zusammen, um dem aufkeimenden Video-Markt den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen. Gelingen soll das mit der Bildplatte - oder Television Electronic Disc (TED). Die Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von etwa 20 Zentimetern fassen zur Markteinführung 1975 maximal zehn Minuten Videomaterial pro Seite. Gegen die VHS-Kassette kann sich die Bildplatte ebensowenig durchsetzen wie VCR oder Betamax. Telefunken selbst versetzt der Television Electronic Disc schließlich den Todesstoß, als man Ende 1978 beginnt, VHS-Geräte herzustellen. 1971 - 1979: VCR-Kassette Die europäische Lösung für den boomenden Videomarkt heißt 1971 VCR. Grundig und Philips entwickeln die Bandtechnologie, die sich unter anderem durch zwei Tonkanäle und eine Laufzeit von zunächst 65 Minuten auszeichnet. Auf dem Consumer-Markt ist das VCR-System durchaus erfolgreich - bis JVC mit seinem VHS-System der Durchbruch gelingt. 1979 - 1986: Video 2000 Um der wachsenden VHS-Konkurrenz Herr zu werden, versuchen Grundig und Philips 1979 mit dem VCR-Nachfolger Video 2000 im Rennen um die Video-Vorherrschaft zu punkten. Neue, beidseitig bespielbare Kassetten ermöglichen Laufzeiten von maximal 16 Stunden. Weil JVC Lizenzen zur Herstellung von VHS-Geräten jedoch deutlich günstiger vergibt, ist der "Krieg der Videoformate" Anfang der 1980er Jahre längst entschieden. 1985 beschließen Grundig und Philips, die Produktion von Video 2000-Geräten und -Datenträgern einzustellen. 1976 - 2016: Betamax Auch Sony mischt im Krieg der Videoformate mit. Mit Betamax wollen die Japaner das Rennen machen. Im Gegensatz zum von vorneherein für professionelle Anwender gedachten U-Matic-Format ist Betamax ausschließlich für den Consumer-Markt konzipiert. Betamax-Kassetten sind mit Laufzeiten von 30 bis 215 Minuten erhältlich. Von allen VHS-Konkurrenz-Formaten kann sich Betamax am längsten halten. Bis 2002 werden Abspielgeräte produziert, Betamax-Bänder sind bis heute erhältlich. Allerdings kündigt Sony Ende 2015 an, die Herstellung der Bänder zum März 2016 einzustellen. 1978 - 2001: Laserdisc Das erste optische Speichermedium für Videos kommt 1978 auf den Markt: Discovision. Die beidseitig bespielbaren Scheiben mit einem Durchmesser von circa 30 Zentimetern bieten Laufzeiten von bis zu 120 Minuten. Die Videoqualität bewegt sich bereits in etwa auf dem Level der wesentlich später eingeführten DVD. Die Firma Pioneer vermarktet die Technologie ab 1981 unter der Bezeichnung Laserdisc. Das mit analogem Video- und digitalem Audiomaterial befüllte Medium ist insbesondere in Japan sehr erfolgreich. In den USA und Europa verhindern unter anderem hohe Preise für Abspielgeräte und die Discs selbst eine hohe Verbreitung. Im Jahr 2001 erscheinen in Japan die letzten Filme auf Laserdisc - bei Cineasten und Sammlern ist das Medium bis heute sehr gefragt. 1987 - 2005: Digital Audio Tape Mit dem Digital Audio Tape (DAT) will Sony ab 1987 den Nachfolger der Audiokassette etablieren. Die Audioqualität eines DAT ist in etwa vergleichbar mit der einer Audio-CD. Als maßgebliches Verbreitungshemmnis gilt der implementierte Kopierschutz, der das einfach Kopieren eines DAT verhindert. Zudem sind DAT-Abspielgeräte im Vergleich zu Minidisc- oder CD-Playern deutlich teurer. Im professionellen Bereich kommt das Digital Audio Tape bis heute zum Einsatz - vor allem in Tonstudios und Radiostationen. 1991 - 1998: CD-i Ende 1991 versucht Philips mit dem CD-i auf dem Markt für Spielkonsolen Fuß zu fassen. Dazu kreiert man nicht nur die Konsole CD-i, sondern - in Kooperation mit Sony - auch das dazu passende Medium: die Compact Disc Interactive. Dieses Format erlaubt die Koexistenz von Audio- und Dateninhalten auf einer Compact Disc. Genutzt wird das Format in erster Linie für Lernprogramme und enorm schlechte Games. Den Massenmarkt erreicht Philips mit dem CD-i-Projekt so nicht und Gamer verschmähen das Gerät geradezu. Auch das Engagement zahlreicher Dritthersteller wie Sony, Panasonic, Grundig, Bang & Olufsen oder Kyocera - die allesamt ebenfalls CD-i-Abspielgeräte anbieten - kann das CD-Derivat nicht retten. Lediglich im Bildungssektor können CD-i-Anwendungen kleine Erfolge verbuchen. Gerüchteweise setzen einige Fahrschulen mit extrem verkrusteten Digitalitäts-Strukturen beim theoretischen Unterricht noch heute auf das CD-i. 1992 - 1996: Digital Compact CAssette Nachdem die Compact Disc die bis dahin verbreiteten Musik-Kassetten weitgehend verdrängt hat, bringen Philips und Panasonic die Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) auf den Markt. Gegenüber ihrer analogen Vorgängerin kann die DCC mit einer deutlich besseren Klangqualität punkten. Im Vergleich zu den damals aktuellen Konkurrenz-Formaten (CD, MP3, Minidisc) ist die Handhabung jedoch deutlich komplizierter. Auch im professionellen Bereich bleibt der DCC der Durchbruch versagt. 1992 - 2011: Minidisc Nachdem Sony mit dem DAT-Format auf dem Consumer-Markt scheitert, versuchen die Japaner mit der magneto-optischen Minidisc den nächsten großen Datenträger-Wurf zu landen. Bis zu 80 Minuten Audiomaterial fasst eine Minidisc, die zudem unempfindlich gegenüber Schmutz und Staub ist. In Europa und den USA kann sich der Datenträger dennoch nicht durchsetzen - zu groß ist die Konkurrenz durch CD und später MP3. In Japan ist die Minidisc hingegen ähnlich populär wie die Compact Disc in Deutschland. Bis Ende des Jahres 2011 vertreibt lediglich Sony noch MD-Abspielgeräte, bevor die Produktion schließlich endgültig eingestellt wird. 1994 - 2016: Zip-Diskette Mitte der 1990er versucht Iomega (heute Lenovo EMC) mit der Zip-Diskette den Nachfolger der Floppy Disk zu etablieren. Das Rezept scheint zunächst aufzugehen: CD-Brenner sind zu dieser Zeit unerschwinglich, die Bandbreiten verhindern die Versendung großer Datenmengen über das Internet. Die Zip-Diskette füllt diese Lücke zunächst sehr gut. Mit bis zu 750 MB Speicherkapazität lassen sich (zu dieser Zeit) astronomische Datenmengen speichern. Leider machen die zugehörigen (internen und externen) Laufwerke durch fatale Hardware-Fehler von sich reden. Günstige CD-Brenner, USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten sorgen ab der Jahrtausendwende schließlich dafür, dass die Zip-Diskette auf dem Massenmarkt keine Rolle mehr spielt. Im Einsatz sind die Datenträger allerdings bis heute: Verschiedene Unternehmen der Luftfahrtbranche nutzen die Datenträger immer noch für ihre Navigations-Datenbanken. 1996 - 2002: Smart Media Card Im Jahr 1996 steckt die Flash-Technologie noch in den Kinderschuhen. Bei Toshiba stellt man zu diesem Zeitpunkt ein neues Flash-Speichermedium vor: die Smart Media Card. Bis zu 128 MB beträgt die Kapazität der Karten, die vor allem wegen ihrer Störanfälligkeit nur eine geringe Verbreitung finden. Im Jahr 2002 bekommt der Datenträger auch noch einen - nicht minder erfolglosen - Nachfolger. 1997 - 2003: Superdisk Bevor sich die CD-ROM zum Leitmedium auf dem PC-Markt aufschwingt, konkurrieren mehrere Formate darum, die Nachfolge der guten alten Diskette anzutreten. Das von Imation und Matsushita entwickelte, Medium Superdisk besitzt eine Speicherkapazität von bis zu 240 MB. Leider sind die ersten Laufwerke fehlerbehaftet, zudem ist das Konkurrenzprodukt - die Zip-Diskette von Iomega - bereits länger auf dem Markt. Als CD-Brenner schließlich für die Massen erschwinglich werden, verschwinden beide designierte Disketten-Nachfolger vom Markt. 1999 - 2003: Clik-Diskette Auch das nächste proprietäre Speichersystem von Iomega kann sich nicht durchsetzen. Clik-Disketten fassen 40 MB Daten und zeichnen sich vor allem durch ihre Größe aus: mit einem Durchmesser von 5 Zentimetern und einem Gewicht von 15 Gramm sind die Magnetspeicher durchaus handlich - den gerade aufkommenden USB-Sticks und Speicherkarten haben sie jedoch nichts entgegenzusetzen. 1999 - 2010: Versatile Multilayer Disc Im Jahr 1999 entwickelt New Medium Enterprises die Versatile Multilayer Disc (VMD). Anfang der 2000er-Jahre soll die VMD sich schließlich gegen Blu-ray Disc und HD-DVD durchsetzen und zum DVD-Nachfolger avancieren. Mit einer Speicherkapazität von maximal 20 GB (theoretisch 100 GB) ist die VMD sowohl HD-DVD als auch Blu-ray deutlich unterlegen. Kurz vor der geplanten Markteinführung im Jahr 2007 wird es dann still um die VMD - und das hat sich bis heute nicht geändert. Seit 2010 sind sämtliche Hersteller-Websites nicht mehr erreichbar. 2002 - 2009: xD-Picture Card Die Foto-Riesen Olympus und Fujifilm tun sich im Jahr 2002 zusammen, um einen Nachfolger der glücklosen Smart Media Card zu etablieren: die xD-Picture Card. Hergestellt werden die bis zu 2 GB fassenden NAND-Flash-Karten von Toshiba und Samsung. Die Abkürzung xD steht im Übrigen für "Extreme Digital". Gegenüber einer SD-Karte ist die xD-Picture Card allerdings deutlich teurer, was wohl der Hauptgrund dafür ist, dass die xD-Karten langsam aber sicher in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versinken. 2005 - 2008: HD-DVD Im Jahr 2005 fechten zwei neue Datenträger den Kampf um die HD-Vorherrschaft und die Nachfolge der DVD aus. Zu den Unterstützern der bis zu 51 GB (Blu-ray Disc: 128 GB) fassenden HD-DVD gehören neben Toshiba, NEC, Intel und IBM auch Microsoft und HP. Als Anfang 2008 mehrere Film-Riesen (darunter Time Warner, Senator Film und das US-Pornostudio Digital Playground) ihre Untersützung für die HD-DVD einstellen, ist das Schicksal des Datenträgers besiegelt: Weitere Händler stellen den Verkauf von HD-DVDs ein, woraufhin Toshiba - das die meisten Abspielgeräte auf den Markt gebracht hatte - die Herstellung und den Vertrieb von HD-DVDs und Abspielgeräten offiziell einstellt. Der Kampf gegen die Blu-ray (forciert unter anderem von Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, LG und Samsung) ist damit verloren. 2005 - 2011: Universal Media Disc Mit der Universal Media Disc (UMD) schafft Sony 2005 für seine gerade neu entwickelte Handheld-Konsole Playstation Portable ein eigenes Speichermedium. Die UMD erinnert optisch an die Minidisc, fasst maximal 1,8 GB Daten und dient als Medium für Spiele, Filme und Musik. Mit der nächsten Generation der tragbaren Sony-Konsole wird die UMD fallen gelassen wie die sprichwörtliche, heiße Kartoffel. Welche Betriebssysteme unterstützen Optane? Um es mit den Worten von Intel zu sagen: "Software muss angepasst werden, um effektiv mit Optane zu laufen". Die PC-Hersteller wiederum halten es für wahrscheinlich, dass Windows 10 für den Einsatz von Optane bereit ist - nicht zuletzt dank Intel Drivern und Technologien wie RST (Rapid Storage Technology), die eine optimale Nutzung der Storage-Technologie versprechen. Ob Linux und macOS Optane in einem ähnlichen "Plug and Play"-Maß unterstützen werden, bleibt hingegen fraglich. Speziell Linux ist bekannt dafür, Support für neue Technologien erst recht spät zur Verfügung zu stellen. Mit Material von IDG News Service. Uwe Müller, Head of Sales & PreSales Datacenter, ; Cisco "Der Einsatz von immer mehr Applikationen führt verstärkt zu einer dezentralen Datenhaltung, die eine dezentrale Verarbeitung erfordert. Das äußert sich beispielsweise in der Zunahme virtueller Desktops oder durch zunehmende Dezentralität von Infrastruktur-Bestandteilen." Lars Göbel, Leiter Vertrieb & IT-Services, DARZ GmbH „Steigende Anforderungen an Speicherumgebungen erfordern von Storage-Systemen auch zukünftig mehr Leistung als bisher. IT-Verantwortliche sollten daher im nächsten Jahr verstärkt auf das Thema All Flash setzen, das auch durch die zunehmende Verbreitung von SSD-Speichermedien weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt." Hans Schramm Field Product Manager Enterprise Dell bei Dell EMC "Die IT hat begonnen sich zu wandeln: von einem klassischen IT-Stack mit Applikation, Betriebssystem, Hypervisor, Server, Network und Storage hin zu konvergenten oder sogar hyperkonvergenten Strukturen. Server lassen sich als Universallösung nutzen und werden vermehrt auch im Bereich Storage eingesetzt." Stefan Roth, Head of Storage, Category Management Datacentre Central Europe, Fujitsu "Flash-Storage ist weiter auf dem Vormarsch, sowohl All-Flash als auch Hybrid-Flash. Darüber hinaus wird Software Defined Storage aufgrund der höheren Anforderungen an die Skalierbarkeit sowie größerer Komplexität und Kosten immer wichtiger werden." Florian Bettges, Category Manager Storage, Hewlett Packard Enterprise "Fortschrittliche Analytics-Anwendungen werden in immer mehr Unternehmen zu einem wichtigen Teil der Geschäftsstrategie und verändern damit grundlegend die Anforderungen, die an Storage-Lösungen gestellt werden." Jürgen A. Krebs, CTO für die Region EMEA von Hitachi Data Systems "Die wichtigsten Themen sind hier Agilität und Flexibilität. Unternehmen gehen dazu verstärkt den Weg in die (Private) Cloud. Gleichzeitig ändert sich das Kaufverhalten der Kunden. Sie wollen zunehmend klassische Investitionen (Capex) durch laufende Betriebsausgaben (Opex) ersetzen, was im Storage-Bereich verbrauchsabhängige Abrechnungsmodelle erfordert.“ Ralf Colbus, Leading Storage Professional, IBM „Wenn in Zukunft ein Service angefordert wird, wird es unwichtig sein, ob dieser on-premise oder off-premise ausgeführt wird. Ein IT-Verantwortlicher muss sich also auf Hybrid-Services ausrichten. Die Cloud wirkt dann als erweitertes Rechenzentrum." Peter Wüst, Senior Director Emerging Solutions & Innovation Group EMEA, NetApp "Flash ist Standard. Daten werden immer mehr und wichtiger und daher wird die Kompetenz im Datenmanagement wichtiger. Die sichere und einfache Verschiebung von Daten für Cloud-Workloads ist eine Anforderung an moderne Speichersysteme. Objektstorage und skalierbarer Cloudstorage (onpremise/offpremise) werden als weitere Storageklassen eingeführt. Flash ersetzt SAS als Storagetier.“ Joachim Berger, Sales Director DACH bei Nimble Storage „Wir haben in diesem Jahr eine stetig wachsende Anzahl an Unternehmen gesehen, die damit beginnen, Flash- und All-Flash-Technologien in ihre Rechenzentren zu integrieren. Diese Technologien benötigen vorausschauende Analyse-Möglichkeiten, um Ausfallzeiten auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und für eine optimale Verfügbarkeit von Anwendungen und Daten zu sorgen.“ Thomas Muggendobler, Product Manager Storage, Thomas-Krenn AG „All-Flash-Systeme werden auch bei mittleren und größeren Kapazitäten die mechanischen Festplatten weiter verdrängen. Wir stellen vor allem fest, dass bei den Anwendern neben den stark gefallenen Anschaffungspreisen auch die deutlich niedrigeren Betriebskosten in den Fokus rücken.“ Artikel als PDF kaufen Newsletter 'Produkte+Technologien' bestellen!   comments powered by Disqus BLOCKCHAIN FÜR EXECUTIVES Bilden Sie sich mit COMPUTERWOCHE und der ESMT Berlin zum Thema Blockchain weiter – Hintergründe, Cases, Vernetzung!

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated May 2, 2017 9:58AM SHARE ALSO SEE Intel Cybersecurity Vulnerability Firmware Data Security Network Security Enterprise IT Top Tech News A researcher with an Internet of Things security startup recently identified a critical vulnerability in Intel firmware that could allow an attacker to access enterprise systems using Intel's Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology or Standard Manageability. Intel published details about the vulnerability on its Security Center yesterday. The company is warning users to check with their equipment manufacturers for updated firmware or, if that's unavailable, to take steps to secure their systems. Identified by Maksim Malyutin, a researcher with the Berkeley-based startup Embedi, the vulnerability has existed in systems released by Intel since 2010-2011. Intel noted in its security advisory that the bug does not affect any of its consumer PCs. Firmware Patching Poses Challenges The escalation of privilege vulnerability, CVE-2017-5689, could allow a hacker to remotely access machines running Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) or Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). It could also enable an unauthorized user to change management features on systems running either AMT, ISM or Intel's Small Business Technology. "The vulnerability is a serious threat and the prevention measures from exploitation is a timely process for users -- timely, but necessary," Embedi said in a blog post today. "It is also important to note the difficulties with firmware patching, which is needed to mitigate this vulnerability. Firmware patching takes an extremely long time to test before it is deployed to all of their users." While initial reports suggested the vulnerability has existed since 2008, Embedi said the bug affects only Intel firmware that's come out since 2010 at the earliest. In a tweet today, Embedi CTO Dmitriy Evdokimov posted a graph from the IoT device search engine Shodan showing that top organizations potentially affected by the AMT vulnerability include several universities, as well as telcos such as Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom. Working To Update 'ASAP' Intel's Security Center advisory provides links to both a PDF guide to detect which systems might have the vulnerability, and a downloadable mitigation guide. According to the mitigation guide, "Intel highly recommends that the first step in all mitigation paths is to unprovision the Intel manageability SKU to address the network privilege escalation vulnerability." Intel spokesperson William Moss told Kaspersky Labs' Threatpost, "We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible." In his personal blog yesterday, Matthew Garrett, a security developer at Google, noted the vulnerability doesn't affect all Intel systems that have come out over the past few years. "Most Intel systems don't ship with AMT," Garrett said. "Most Intel systems with AMT don't have it turned on." However, users with systems that have turned on AMT should be aware of the vulnerability and take action to address it, he added. "If a vendor is no longer providing updates then it should at least be possible for a sufficiently desperate user to pay someone else to do a firmware build with the appropriate fixes," Garrett said. "Leaving firmware updates at the whims of hardware manufacturers who will only support systems for a fraction of their useful lifespan is inevitably going to end badly." Image credit: Intel.

Updated May 02, 2017. Networking giant Cisco is reinforcing its efforts to expand its presence in cloud-delivered and Internet of Things services by acquiring networking startup Viptela, a cloud-based software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) company. Cisco announced the acquisition yesterday, saying the move will help build on its existing SD-WAN portfolio while providing clients with more functionality. The $610 million deal is expected to close sometime in the second half of this year, with Viptela's team becoming part of Cisco's enterprise routing unit, which is itself part of Cisco’s larger network and security business division. Cloud-First WAN "Viptela's technology is cloud-first, with a focus on simplicity and ease of deployment while simultaneously providing a rich set of capabilities and scale. These principles are what today's customers demand," said Scott Harrell, senior vice president of product management for the Cisco enterprise networking group. "With Viptela and Cisco, we will be able to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of comprehensive on-premises, hybrid, and cloud-based SD-WAN solutions." Viptela's SD-WAN service is geared toward simplifying the work of managing dispersed enterprise networks. The company said that helps companies reduce the costs associated with network management while also providing them with greater flexibility and faster response times. As for Cisco, the company said the acquisition fits neatly into its efforts to offer more software-defined WAN support for enterprises that may be struggling with adding many more mobile devices or IoT devices to their corporate networks than they had originally anticipated. While the deal helps build out Cisco's WAN services, particularly its cloud-delivered offerings, the acquisition also furthers the company's strategy of transitioning its business toward more software-based services, which it said will provide more predictable, recurring revenues. Building Out Cloud Services The Viptela deal is only the latest move by Cisco as it aggressively seeks to make a name for itself as a provider of cloud-based and IoT services. That has resulted in a slew of acquisitions, more than 19 since 2015. While the Viptela buy will likely provide Cisco's enterprise network services some nice new features, the deal is not even one of the biggest moves that the company has made this year. The acquisition of cloud company AppDynamics for $3.7 billion right before that company was set to go public earlier this year dwarfs this announcement. And last year, Cisco acquired cloud-based IoT platform Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. Just last week, Cisco announced the launch of a new enterprise service for the Jasper platform to help companies manage and connect with their employees’ mobile devices. And in March, the company announced that it was joining the Three Group, which manages a global portfolio of high-speed mobile networks, to provide IoT services to enterprise clients starting in the second half of the year.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel Identifies Critical Firmware Bug That's Lurked Nearly 10 Years By Shirley Siluk / Enterprise Security Today PUBLISHED: MAY 02 2017 A researcher with an Internet of Things security startup recently identified a critical vulnerability in Intel firmware that could allow an attacker to access enterprise systems using Intel's Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology or Standard Manageability. Intel published details about the vulnerability on its Security Center yesterday. The company is warning users to check with their equipment manufacturers for updated firmware or, if that's unavailable, to take steps to secure their systems. Identified by Maksim Malyutin, a researcher with the Berkeley-based startup Embedi, the vulnerability has existed in systems released by Intel since 2010-2011. Intel noted in its security advisory that the bug does not affect any of its consumer PCs. Firmware Patching Poses Challenges The escalation of privilege vulnerability, CVE-2017-5689, could allow a hacker to remotely access machines running Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) or Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). It could also enable an unauthorized user to change management features on systems running either AMT, ISM or Intel's Small Business Technology. "The vulnerability is a serious threat and the prevention measures from exploitation is a timely process for users -- timely, but necessary," Embedi said in a blog post today. "It is also important to note the difficulties with firmware patching, which is needed to mitigate this vulnerability. Firmware patching takes an extremely long time to test before it is deployed to all of their users." While initial reports suggested the vulnerability has existed since 2008, Embedi said the bug affects only Intel firmware that's come out since 2010 at the earliest. In a tweet today, Embedi CTO Dmitriy Evdokimov posted a graph from the IoT device search engine Shodan showing that top organizations potentially affected by the AMT vulnerability include several universities, as well as telcos such as Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom. Working To Update 'ASAP' Intel's Security Center advisory provides links to both a PDF guide to detect which systems might have the vulnerability, and a downloadable mitigation guide. According to the mitigation guide, "Intel highly recommends that the first step in all mitigation paths is to unprovision the Intel manageability SKU to address the network privilege escalation vulnerability." Intel spokesperson William Moss told Kaspersky Labs' Threatpost, "We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible." In his personal blog yesterday, Matthew Garrett, a security developer at Google, noted the vulnerability doesn't affect all Intel systems that have come out over the past few years. "Most Intel systems don't ship with AMT," Garrett said. "Most Intel systems with AMT don't have it turned on." However, users with systems that have turned on AMT should be aware of the vulnerability and take action to address it, he added. "If a vendor is no longer providing updates then it should at least be possible for a sufficiently desperate user to pay someone else to do a firmware build with the appropriate fixes," Garrett said. "Leaving firmware updates at the whims of hardware manufacturers who will only support systems for a fraction of their useful lifespan is inevitably going to end badly." Image credit: Intel.

Google, FB Victims of $100M Scam Next Article > Microsoft Boosts Safety with Windows Defender Security Center By Shirley Siluk / Enterprise Security Today PUBLISHED: MAY 01 2017 The latest update to Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system features a number of changes to its built-in security protection. Rolling out in phases since April 11, the Creators Update adds a new dashboard display for Windows Defender, introduces dynamic locking capabilities and also offers new privacy controls. However, Microsoft is also cautioning users who have not yet received the update automatically to avoid downloading the new OS manually. That's because the company continues to work on hammering out problems the Creators Update can create on some devices. New Dashboard Display for Security Options One of the new safety features arriving with the Creators Update is the Windows Defender Security Center. "The Windows Defender Security Center offers a single dashboard display so you can control your security options from one place -- everything from anti-virus, network, and firewall protection; to assessing your device performance and health; to security controls for your apps and browser; to family safety options," Windows Blog editor-in-chief Mollie Ruiz-Hopper noted last month in an overview about the Creators Update. Enterprise users with the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service also have new capabilities for tracking security threats via the Windows Security Center, Ruiz-Hopper said. The security portal now uses the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to link to Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, enabling IT administrators to "easily follow an attack across endpoints and email in a seamless and integrated way." Users of Windows Hello, Microsoft's biometric security system, can also use a paired device to automatically lock PCs or tablets when they walk away. The dynamic lock feature works with paired smartphones, fitness wearables and other devices. Update Caution for Older Devices Microsoft is rolling out the Creators Update in phases, starting with newer devices first, to avoid potential problems the new operating system could cause for older machines, according to John Cable, director of program management for Windows servicing and delivery. As it becomes aware of such issues, the company might deploy blocks that automatically prevent the update from installing on devices with known issues, he said in a blog post last week. "It's important to note that when customers use the Software Download Site to manually install the Creators Update they bypass many of these blocks," Cable said. "Therefore, we continue to recommend (unless you're an advanced user who is prepared to work through some issues) that you wait until the Windows 10 Creators Update is automatically offered to you." Such blocks will be removed after an issue has been resolved, he added. When that occurs, users who had been affected by the blocks will be prompted to update their privacy settings before the Creators Update is installed. Meanwhile, Windows Insiders who are testing even newer versions of the operating system should be alert to other known security issues, Windows and Devices Group software engineer Dona Sarkar said in a blog post Friday. These include a problem on some PCs that prevents a security reset and a glitch that keeps Windows Defender from opening upon double-clicking the Windows Defender icon. Image credit: Microsoft.

Twitter Facebook These new super fast Intel SSDs provide a bridge to Optane Intel's SSDs for data centers are among the company's fastest Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 03 May, 2017 02:30 - - - - print email Comments If you can't afford Intel's super fast Optane SSDs but need a massive speed boost, the company's latest DC P4600 and DC P4500 SSDs may fill the need. The new SSDs are based on conventional 3D NAND and targeted at data centers. The SSDs will be used in servers or storage arrays to serve up quick video streams, voice-assistant AI responses, and even pull out information from databases. These SSDs are a reliable upgrade for those who don't want to mess with Optane, which is based on brand-new memory technology. According to Intel's rough estimate, the P4500 and P4600 drives provide two times faster read and write performance compared to predecessors, the DC P3520 and P3600 drives. The NVMe drives are not compatible with the common SATA interface. The P4600 will come in capacities of 1.6TB ($1,384) and 3.2TB ($2,589) for the U.2 form factorÂ and 2TB ($1,619) and 4TB ($3,239) for the AIC form factor. The drive has random read speeds of 702,500 IOPS (input/output operations per second) and write speeds of 257,000 IOPs in 4K blocks. The drive has sequential read speeds of 3300MBps (megabytes per second) and write speeds of 2100MBps. The P4500 will come in capacities of 1TB ($624), 2TB ($1,159), and 4TB ($2,314). Its random read speed is 710,000 IOPS and itsÂ write speed is 68,000 IOPS, which is significantly less than the P4600. The sequential read speed is 3290 MBps, and write speed is 1890MBps. These SSDs are more affordable than Optane, said Jonmichael Hands, product marketing manager at the company. The drives will be available worldwide. Intel has made tweaks that specialize the SSDs for data centers. The drivers and controllers have been improved, which boosts the speed and reliability, Hands said. The P4500 and P4600 are targeted at cloud computing but can be used for other applications. too. All-flash storage arrays can run a wide variety of applications. The main job for the SSDs is to serve as cache, or temporary storage, while applications are executed. The drives also have error correction and tools that ensure high performance and reliability. These SSDs are closely designed to work with Intel's x86 chips, particularly the upcoming Skylake server chip, which will be launched mid-year Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the Computerworld newsletter!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Everything Microsoft announced at its Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S launch event 2 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ May 2, 2017 at 16:37 GMT14 hours ago Microsoft announced quite a lot of things at its #MicrosoftEDU event today. The company today announced new hardware, as well as new software to go along with the new hardware at the event. The latest event from Microsoft isn’t as big as some of the previous hardware events, but it’s still pretty huge if you are a Microsoft fan. So let’s get right into it. Surface Laptop This is, obviously, the biggest product launch at the #MicrosoftEDU event. The Surface Laptop is the latest addition to Microsoft’s Surface brand, and it is a pretty slick one. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop runs Windows 10 S, which is a new version of Windows 10 that Microsoft announced at today’s event. Surface Laptop is a Chromebook competitor from Microsoft, but similar to Google’s Chromebook Pixel device, the Surface Laptop is kind of like a premium Windows 10 S laptop. In terms of specs, you won’t get disappointed as the Surface Laptop packs Intel’s latest and greatest Kaby Lake processors, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of SSD storage. As for the display, Microsoft is packing a 13.5-inch PixelSense display and the device’s keyboard is also covered by Alcantara which should provide a fairly unique experience. And, oh, the device’s battery can apparently last up to 14.5 hours which is more than any MacBook that’s available. The Surface Laptop’s entry model starts at $1,000 — and for the entry-level model, you get the Intel Core i5, 128GB of SSD storage, 4GB RAM, and the Intel HD Graphics 620. This is also the first Surface device from Microsoft to come in multiple different colors, as the Surface Laptop will be available in Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S might be a bummer for some users — but we’ve some good news for you: Microsoft will actually let users upgrade to Windows 10 Pro on the Surface Laptop before the end of this year. You can pre-order the Surface Laptop from the Microsoft Store here, and it will start shipping early next month. Windows 10 S Microsoft also introduced a new version of Windows 10 at the event — and that’s Windows 10 S. The new version of Windows 10 was previously known as Windows 10 Cloud internally, but Microsoft is changing it to Windows 10 S for the public launch — possibly to make the branding less confusing. Windows 10 S is essentially a version of Windows 10 for students. Windows 10 S is still Windows as you know it, but it doesn’t include some features which also helps to improve the security of the OS. First and foremost, Windows 10 S won’t let you install apps from outside of the Windows Store — which means you won’t be able to install the classic Win32 apps such as Google Chrome or Spotify. But that doesn’t mean you completely won’t be able to install the classic desktop apps as some Win32 apps are available from the Windows Store already. But what about the classic Office apps? Microsoft is also bringing those to the Windows Store, which means you will get the full power of Office on devices running Windows 10 S which is really neat. And, oh, you will be able to Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro whenever you want which is really great because you are not locked to Windows 10 S and can upgrade to a more powerful version of Windows 10 whenever you want. Devices powered by Windows 10 S will start at $189, which is a pretty good price. And as these devices are going to be targetted towards Microsoft’s educational audience, that’s crucial. Office apps on the Windows Store The Surface Laptop is targetted towards education, and so is Windows 10 S which powers the laptop. But Windows 10 S can only run apps from the Windows Store, which means you can’t run the classic Office desktop apps on the Surface Laptop and other devices running Windows 10 S. Thankfully though, Microsoft also announced today that it’s bringing the full Office suite to the Windows Store — allowing Windows 10 S users to use the full-fledged version of the Office apps on their new PCs. The full-fledged Office apps will also be available to users running other versions of Windows 10. In addition to that, Microsoft is also going to let users subscribe to Office 365 right from the Windows Store which is pretty neat. Users will be able to choose between a yearly or a monthly subscription, and Microsoft will also provide subscription options for the different SKUs of Office (Personal, Home, etc.). Everything else There were a couple of other announcements by Microsoft at the event, but those were pretty minor: There’s a new Surface Arc Mouse with improved design Windows 10’s View 3D app will let users place 3D content in the real world Spotify is coming to the Windows Store for Windows 10 PCs Minecraft: Education Edition gets a built-in code builder to help students learn how to code 3D is coming to PowerPoint Microsoft Teams is getting new features specifically for Microsoft’s education audience You can pre-order it from Microsoft’s online Store from the Store link here.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 22, 2017 3:42 PM PT Credit: James Niccolai More like this Qualcomm's new chip may be too late as ARM server market fades Like in PCs, Microsoft and ARM look to topple Intel in servers Microsoft's Windows Server OS runs on ARM chips, with help from Qualcomm Video Windows Defender: What changes in Windows 10 Creators Update When he was growing up, a dream of Linux pioneer Linus Torvalds was to acquire the Acorn Archimedes, a groundbreaking personal computer with the first ARM RISC chips. But in 1987, Archimedes wasn’t available to Torvalds in Finland, so he settled for the Sinclair QL. In the meanwhile, the Archimedes failed and disappeared from the scene, killing any chance for ARM chips to dominate PCs. Since then, multiple attempts to put ARM chips in PCs have failed. Outside of a few Chromebooks, most PCs have x86 chips from Intel or AMD. The domination of x86 is a problem for Linaro, an industry organization that advocates ARM hardware and software. Many of its developers use x86 PCs to compile programs for ARM hardware. That’s much like trying to write Windows programs on a Mac. That fact doesn’t sit well with George Grey, CEO of Linaro. “Linus mentioned this a little while ago: How do we get developers to work on ARM first? Why are will still using Intel tools?” Grey asked during a speech at this month’s Linaro Connect conference in Budapest. A powerful Linux laptop or mini-desktop based on an ARM processor needs to built so developers can write and compile applications, he said. “May be we can take a Chromebook design and put more memory, get upstream Linux support on it, and use it as a developer platform for developers to carry to conferences,” Grey said then. To further that idea, a group of ARM hardware enthusiasts gathered in a room at Linaro Connect to conceptualize a powerful ARM PC. The group settled on building a computer like the Intel NUC—a mini-desktop with a powerful board computer in it. The free-flowing session was entertaining, with attendees passionately sharing ideas on the chip, memory, storage, and other components in the PC. The session, which is available on Linaro’s site, also highlighted issues involved in building and supporting an ARM-based PC. There were concerns about whether ARM chips would deliver performance adequate to run powerful applications. There were also concerns about components and about providing a Linux user experience acceptable to users. Also important was building a viable ARM PC that would attract hardware makers to participate in such an effort. One worry was the reaction of the enthusiast audience, who might sound off if an ARM desktop didn’t work properly, putting hardware vendors and chipmakers at the receiving end of criticism and bad press. “Based on a research and efforts today, building an ideal PC is going to be hard,” said Yang Zhang, director of the technologies group at Linaro. Attendees quickly agreed that the ARM PC would need an expandable x86-style board with DDR4 memory DIMM slot, and NVMe or SATA slots for plugging in SSDs or other drives. Other features would include gigabit slots and USB slots. “Definitely, we need to be looking at something with real I/O, not some crappy mobile chipset with soldered-on 2GB of RAM,” one attendee said. (Attendees aren’t identified in the recording of the discussion.) Many ARM-based computer boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Pine64 can be used as PCs, but have limited expandability and components integrated on the board. They aren’t ideal for PCs handling heavy workloads. Also, Zhang pointed out that LPDDR4, which is used in such “mobile” chipsets, is slower than DDR4 memory, which is why the DIMM slots would be needed on the ARM PC. Next, the discussion shifted to the system-on-chip, and suggestions were made to use CPUs from companies including Marvell and Nvidia. Chips from Qualcomm, Cavium, and HiSilicon weren’t suggested because those companies were uninterested in building a PC-style computer for development with Linaro. Ironically, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 will be used in Windows 10 PCs later this year. An interesting suggestion was Rockchip’s RK3399, which is being used in Samsung’s Chromebook Pro, which has PCI-Express and USB 3.0. Google and Samsung have been putting in a decent amount of work for Linux support on the chip. But it still is a mobile chip, and not designed for full-powered ARM desktop. “I have a 24-core Opteron right. To replace that I would need a 64-core Cortex A73 or something, which doesn’t exist,” said the attendee who suggested the RK3399. The discussion became a battle between server chips and mobile chips, which each had their issues. While the server chips boast good software support, they are expensive. The mobile chips are cheap but have poor Linux OS support. Software support would need to be added by independent developers, and that can be a considerable amount of work. In 2015, 96boards—the ARM hardware effort of Linaro — built a development board called HuskyBoard wth AMD’s Opteron A1100 server chip, but that didn’t go well. AMD has now abandoned ARM server chips and recently released the 32-core Naples chip based on its x86 Zen architecture. The initial PC will perhaps have a server chip with decent Linux kernel support. Standard interfaces, sufficient memory, and decent graphics will matter more, as will ensuring that standard components like heatsinks and memory DIMMs can be bought off the shelf. The purpose of the gathering was to get the ball rolling for the development of a real desktop based on ARM. The PC will likely be developed by 96boards, which provides specifications to build open-source development boards.

These new super fast Intel SSDs provide a bridge to Optane Intel's SSDs for data centers are among the company's fastest Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 03 May, 2017 02:30 0 - - - - print email If you can't afford Intel's super fast Optane SSDs but need a massive speed boost, the company's latest DC P4600 and DC P4500 SSDs may fill the need. The new SSDs are based on conventional 3D NAND and targeted at data centers. The SSDs will be used in servers or storage arrays to serve up quick video streams, voice-assistant AI responses, and even pull out information from databases. These SSDs are a reliable upgrade for those who don't want to mess with Optane, which is based on brand-new memory technology. According to Intel's rough estimate, the P4500 and P4600 drives provide two times faster read and write performance compared to predecessors, the DC P3520 and P3600 drives. The NVMe drives are not compatible with the common SATA interface. The P4600 will come in capacities of 1.6TB ($1,384) and 3.2TB ($2,589) for the U.2 form factorÂ and 2TB ($1,619) and 4TB ($3,239) for the AIC form factor. The drive has random read speeds of 702,500 IOPS (input/output operations per second) and write speeds of 257,000 IOPs in 4K blocks. The drive has sequential read speeds of 3300MBps (megabytes per second) and write speeds of 2100MBps. The P4500 will come in capacities of 1TB ($624), 2TB ($1,159), and 4TB ($2,314). Its random read speed is 710,000 IOPS and itsÂ write speed is 68,000 IOPS, which is significantly less than the P4600. The sequential read speed is 3290 MBps, and write speed is 1890MBps. These SSDs are more affordable than Optane, said Jonmichael Hands, product marketing manager at the company. The drives will be available worldwide. Intel has made tweaks that specialize the SSDs for data centers. The drivers and controllers have been improved, which boosts the speed and reliability, Hands said. The P4500 and P4600 are targeted at cloud computing but can be used for other applications. too. All-flash storage arrays can run a wide variety of applications. The main job for the SSDs is to serve as cache, or temporary storage, while applications are executed. The drives also have error correction and tools that ensure high performance and reliability. These SSDs are closely designed to work with Intel's x86 chips, particularly the upcoming Skylake server chip, which will be launched mid-year Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 More from Microsoft Windows 10 Join the PC World newsletter!

By Mark Gurman and Dina Bass Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it's chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft Corp., a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 2.76 pounds, about a quarter-pound less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13.5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market—and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience—including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the $999 machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype—little more than a mashup of parts from older Microsoft devices—to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first-hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer's main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfiber that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colors, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling.” The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don't let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminum alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the auto industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware—a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day.” (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available June 15, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch—and letting the Mac lineup languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for.” Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1,000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.” Want stories like this in your inbox?

The new Intel SSD DC P4500 and P4600 are the successors to the P3500, P3600 and P3700 series, modernizing the product line with a new SSD controller and 3D NAND flash across the full range of models. Most of Intel's datacenter PCIe SSDs have still been using 20nm MLC NAND flash, though the P3500 did get replaced with the P3520 using Intel's 3D MLC. The new P4x00 generation moves everything over to Intel's 32-layer 3D TLC NAND flash. With a per-die capacity of 384Gb (48GB) compared to 128Gb (16GB) for Intel's 20nm MLC, it's no surprise to see greatly expanded capacities: where the old P3x00 generation offered capacities from 400GB to 2TB, the new P4500 and P4600 start at 1TB and initially offer up to 4TB, with 8TB models expected by the end of the year. Enterprise SSDs have mostly used MLC NAND for the past several years since SLC was abandoned by the market, but Intel's decision to go with 3D TLC for all of the new enterprise PCIe SSDs is not entirely unprecedented. A few months ago Micron's new generation of enterprise SATA SSDs was announced with 3D TLC used for even the highest-endurance models rated for five drive writes per day. Samsung also uses 3D TLC for their flagship PM1725a enterprise NVMe SSD. With the Optane SSD DC P4800X now covering the high-performance market segment using 3D XPoint memory instead of flash memory, it makes sense for Intel to choose the higher capacity offered by TLC and make up any deficit in write endurance with greater overprovisioning. The flash memory used in Intel's previous generation of datacenter PCIe SSDs wasn't the only outdated component. With the exception of the dual-port DC D3700 and D3600 and the very low-end DC P3100, Intel's entire lineup was still based on their first NVMe controller that debuted in the P3700. That controller was responsible for the 2TB limit that is inadequate in today's market (and was circumvented by the dual-controller P3608). Intel hasn't said what the maximum drive capacity supported by the new controller is, but they mention that a 16TB U.2 drive should be possible with the current generation of 3D NAND and even higher capacities will soon be possible (if not economical) from the upcoming 512Gb 64-layer 3D TLC. The new controller only provides 12 channels for connecting to the flash memory, down from the 18 channels offered by the previous generation but still substantially higher than the channel count of client/consumer-oriented NVMe controllers. Any potential loss in throughput from the lower channel count is offset by each channel now supporting the faster ONFI 4.0 interface, and the new SSDs can hit sequential read speeds of up to 3290 MB/s compared to 2800 MB/s for the Intel P3700. Since the launch of the Intel SSD DC P3700, the NVMe specification has expanded significantly, and the new controller powering the P4500 and P4600 adds quite a few new optional features from the 1.1 and 1.2 revisions of the NVMe standard. The basic functionality has also been enhanced by expanding the range of NVMe commands that are hardware-accelerated with little or no firmware involvement, and by increasing the number of queues supported from 32 to 128 (still with a maximum of 4k commands per queue). The higher queue count will help reduce contention in systems with very high CPU core counts as it is standard practice for NVMe drivers to allocate one queue per core. The biggest new feature set supported by the P4500 and P4600 is full support for the NVMe Management Interface standard for out-of-band management over PCIe or SMBus. This allows IPMI-equipped servers to offer full access to the drive's SMART data and firmware updating through the BMC regardless of the operating system running on the server. The new SSDs now also support multiple NVMe namespaces (up to 128), a drive-managed partitioning scheme that is primarily useful for virtualization scenarios. Intel's previous NVMe SSDs all supported thermal throttling, but now this is exposed and configurable through the standard NVMe power state mechanism, which allows drives to declare numerous power states—both operational and idle—along with the maximum power consumption of the drive in each state and the latency of switching in and out of idle states. The P4500 and P4600 bring support for multiple firmware slots and firmware updates without requiring a full PCIe bus reset, allowing the firmware update process to be safer and quicker and also opening the door to the possibility of toggling between firmwares tuned for different roles. The new SSD controller also brings encryption support, and Intel promises a future firmware update will deliver TCG OPAL functionality. Intel NVMe Datacenter SSD Comparison   P4500 P4600 Form Factor PCIe HHHL or 2.5" 15mm U.2 Interface PCIe 3.1 x4 NVMe 1.2 Memory Intel 384Gb 32-layer 3D TLC Capacities (TB) 1, 2, 4 TB 1.6, 2, 3.2 TB (U.2) 2, 4 TB (HHHL) Sequential Read (64kB) (up to) 3290 MB/s 3280 MB/s Sequential Write (64kB) (up to) 1890 MB/s 2100 MB/s Random Read (4kB) (up to) 710k IOPS 702.5k IOPS Random Write (4kB) (up to) 68k IOPS 257k IOPS Maximum Power Read 10.9 W 9.9 W Write 18.3 W 20.7 W Write Endurance Random workload 0.7 DWPD 2.9 DWPD Sequential workload 4.62 DWPD 4 DWPD Warranty 5 years Taking a look at the performance specifications, the P4500 and P4600 fit in to the usual pattern of having a lower model that is intended for more read-heavy workloads while the higher model is tuned for better performance and write endurance on write intensive workloads. Both drives benefit from substantially improved sequential and random read performance compared with the previous generation, but the P4500 has a slight edge. The P4600 has a moderately better sequential write speed and much better random write speed than the P4500 or last generation's P3700. Peak power consumption is down a bit from the 25W for writes that the largest of the last generation drives required, and when comparing at equal capacity the new P4x00 generation should be substantially more power efficient. The 0.7 DWPD rating of the P4500 is a significant improvement over the 0.3 DWPD rating of the P3500 and on par with the 3D MLC-based P3520. The P4600 covers the performance role of both the P3600 and the P3700, but its endurance is only in the ~3 DWPD class of the P3600, not the 17 DWPD offered by the P3700. For extreme write endurance, Intel's recommended solution is now the Optane SSD DC P4800X at 30 DWPD. Intel hasn't disclosed pricing yet, but with a smaller controller and 3D TLC instead of 20nm MLC, the P4500 and P4600 should easily be able to offer a better value than Intel's aging first-generation NVMe SSDs.

Reply Drumsticks - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link For some reason, I missed Optane having 30 DWPD. It might not be 1000x, but that's pretty nice for Gen 1. Reply Billy Tallis - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link 30 DWPD, but the first batch only gets a 3-year warranty. By the time they start releasing the other capacities they'll be back to a 5-year warranty, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the DWPD rating increased later in the product cycle. Reply HollyDOL - Wednesday, May 03, 2017 - link I suspect Optane actually already has significantly higher endurance, but Intel is playing it safe before they get complete endurance stress testing finished... Writing more than 12PB (30DWPD*3years*365days*375GB) on statistically significant volume of drives, under various working conditions, takes a while.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 2, 2017 10:09 AM PT Credit: Intel More like this Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD What one company learned from testing Intel's superfast Optane SSDs Optane Memory review: Why you may want Intel's futuristic cache in your PC Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD If you can’t afford Intel’s super fast Optane SSDs but need a massive speed boost, the company’s latest DC P4600 and DC P4500 SSDs may fill the need. The new SSDs are based on conventional 3D NAND and targeted at data centers. The SSDs will be used in servers or storage arrays to serve up quick video streams, voice-assistant AI responses, and even pull out information from databases. These SSDs are a reliable upgrade for those who don’t want to mess with Optane, which is based on brand-new memory technology. According to Intel’s rough estimate, the P4500 and P4600 drives provide two times faster read and write performance compared to predecessors, the DC P3520 and P3600 drives. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] The NVMe drives are not compatible with the common SATA interface. The P4600 will come in capacities of 1.6TB ($1,384) and 3.2TB ($2,589) for the U.2 form factor and 2TB ($1,619) and 4TB ($3,239) for the AIC form factor. The drive has random read speeds of 702,500 IOPS (input/output operations per second) and write speeds of 257,000 IOPs in 4K blocks. The drive has sequential read speeds of 3300MBps (megabytes per second) and write speeds of 2100MBps. The P4500 will come in capacities of 1TB ($624), 2TB ($1,159), and 4TB ($2,314). Its random read speed is 710,000 IOPS and its write speed is 68,000 IOPS, which is significantly less than the P4600. The sequential read speed is 3290 MBps, and write speed is 1890MBps. These SSDs are more affordable than Optane, said Jonmichael Hands, product marketing manager at the company. The drives will be available worldwide. Intel has made tweaks that specialize the SSDs for data centers. The drivers and controllers have been improved, which boosts the speed and reliability, Hands said. The P4500 and P4600 are targeted at cloud computing but can be used for other applications. too. All-flash storage arrays can run a wide variety of applications. The main job for the SSDs is to serve as cache, or temporary storage, while applications are executed. The drives also have error correction and tools that ensure high performance and reliability. These SSDs are closely designed to work with Intel’s x86 chips, particularly the upcoming Skylake server chip, which will be launched mid-year To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

It’s going to be a relatively short period of time between reveal and release too, with Microsoft announcing a June release date for the Surface Laptop. There are four configurations in all, with each one running Windows 10 S out of the box. Two of these feature an Intel Core i5 processor with Intel HD Graphics 620. The less expensive one will offer a 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM, while the more expensive of the two bumps up internal SSD storage to 256GB and RAM to 8GB. Though Microsoft hasn’t announced specific pricing details yet, it has said that the Surface Laptop will start at $999, which we can assume is the price for the 128GB Core i5 model. If you need a little more power, there are two models with a Core i7 to choose from. Both ship with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving you a boost in integrated graphics as well. As with the Core i5 configurations, the difference here come down to internal storage and RAM – one has 256GB of SSD storage and 8GB of RAM, while the other has a 512GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. Microsoft has made the Surface Laptop’s color options a centerpiece of marketing thus far, but interestingly, you only have your choice of color in the Core i5/256GB model. With that one, you can choose from burgundy, cobalt blue, graphite gold, or platinum, but in all the others, the sole color option is platinum. Also strange is the fact that we can’t pre-order from Microsoft’s online store just yet. Microsoft, it would seem, is a little slow in opening up pre-orders, despite saying that they’d be available today. In any case, the Surface Laptop launches on June 15, so just about six weeks from now. Will you be buying one? Head down to the comments section and let us know!

By Mark Gurman and Dina Bass. Added by Agency Staff on 2 May 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Microsoft, Microsoft Surface, Microsoft Surface Laptop, Panos Panay, Terry Myerson Tweet Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the US$1 000 laptop for everyone. Microsoft, a company once derided for buggy software, unstable hardware and indifferent design, debuted the Surface Laptop on Tuesday. The machine boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and gets a claimed 14 hours of battery life (two better than Apple’s MacBook Air). Weighing in at 1,25kg, about a 100g less than the Air, the Surface Laptop boasts a 13,5-inch screen and is one of the thinnest and lightest products in its class. Microsoft is targeting the education market — and even threw laptops inside backpacks stuffed with textbooks, notepads and keys to simulate college-kid wear-and-tear. Yet the Surface Laptop’s affordable price, portability and features could appeal to a far broader audience — including Mac loyalists. During a tour at Microsoft’s sprawling Redmond, Washington, headquarters last month, the Surface team showed off the machine’s evolution, starting from the first prototype — little more than a mash-up of parts from older Microsoft devices — to the finished product. The engineers and designers spent two years working on the machine, creating multiple prototypes and inviting partners like Intel to set up shop right on campus. The team’s pride was evident. After years of struggling to crack the hardware market, they were finally building products they themselves would use. “This product is a reflection of our learnings since we started this team,” said Panos Panay, who oversees Surface-brand hardware and has been around long enough to have experienced first hand the early flops and later successes. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasised constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mock-ups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. In an effort to make the surface around the keyboard more pleasing to the eye and touch, designers used Alcantara, a synthetic microfibre that’s more durable than the suede it mimics. The team brought in dozens of giant rolls of fabric and spent six months choosing colours, from a dark burgundy to a platinum hue. Microsoft already uses Alcantara in the covers of its tablets, but that didn’t stop the team from taking a field trip to a BMW dealership to see how the material worked as upholstery. Microsoft chose Alcantara, Panay said, because “it gets rid of that cold, sterile feeling”. The designers couldn’t poke holes in the Alcantara for the speakers so they figured out a way to transmit sound via gaps in the keyboard. The audio was tested in one of many “anechoic” chambers, rooms that don’t let sound in or out. The finished laptop, milled from a slab of custom aluminium alloy, has no screws or holes, save for a pair of microphones to converse with Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant. With its hardware and software teams working together, Microsoft created a new version of its operating system, called Windows 10 S, that’s tailored to the laptop. Terry Myerson, who runs both groups, said inspiration for the “S” came from the car industry, which often uses the letter to flag sporty, high-performance models. The new OS is designed to prevent the computer from slowing down over time and remaining predictable even if under assault from malware — a selling point long touted by Apple’s iOS. (Other manufacturers will install Windows 10 S into their own machines, giving Microsoft a way to compete with cheap machines running Google’s Chrome OS.) Pushing the education market theme, Panay said the Surface Laptop will be “same on commencement day as it is on graduation day”. (Users can still install Windows 10 Pro over Windows 10 S, but they won’t be able to switch back.) The OS also runs only apps offered on Microsoft’s app store. “Everything that runs on this device is going to be trusted and verified by Microsoft,” Myerson said. Panay said the new OS unlocks performance and features not found on many Windows-based machines. The laptop wakes from sleep almost instantly when the lid is opened, and takes seconds to turn on from a fully powered-off state. The slick computer, which will be available on 15 June in the US, arrives at an auspicious moment for Microsoft. The company is riding the success of its Surface Studio and Surface tablets (though sales slipped in the the most recent quarter, dragging down total revenue). Meanwhile, Apple has come under fire from Mac owners for focusing on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch — and letting the Mac line-up languish. The Air hasn’t had a serious makeover since 2010, just a modest upgrade two years ago. Stung by the criticism from the disgruntled faithful, Apple has pledged to do better. Panay said Microsoft has made its own luck, saying his team “created what we know our customers are asking for”. Of course, luring Mac devotees will take some doing because Apple’s OS syncs almost flawlessly with the iPhone, making it a snap to transfer photos, send and receive text messages, and make online payments from a Mac. Users will lose that ability if they switch to the Surface Laptop. And despite the impressive hardware, people are used to the Mac interface, another sticking point. Finally, students may balk at paying almost $1 000 when they can get an adequate laptop for much less. Pete Kyriacou, who helps manage the devices team, is sanguine about the challenges facing Microsoft’s first real laptop. “In the end,” he said, “it’s going to appeal to everyone.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP   Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 5Hlaudi to ‘impart study tips’ to kids 5SABC seeks government bailout 5Among connected in SA, Facebook now bigger than TV 4Watch: SpaceX pulls off textbook launch 4DOC ‘wants new luxury cars’ Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Both are based on Intel's 384Gbit 3D TLC flash technology. Normally TLC Flash of any flavor indicates lower performance and low endurance, but not this time. Intel has architected a brand new 12-channel controller and new firmware to power the DC P4500 and DC P4600. The result? The DC P4500 and DC P4600 are the highest performing Intel NAND-flash SSDs to date.     The DC P4500 is designed for high performance, massively scalable mainstream storage. The DC P4500 is available in capacities of 1, 2, and 4TB and two form factors; U.2 2.5"x 15mm and HHHL AIC. The DC P4500 is rated for 0.7 DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day) and is warranted for 5-years.   Intel DC P4500 steady-state factory specifications:     The DC P4600 sports the exact same physical hardware as the DC P4500. The difference between the DC P4600 and DC P4500 is the amount of overprovisioned space. With a healthy dose of OP, the DC P4600 is designed for caching and fast mixed workload storage performance. The DC P4600 in U.2 2.5"x 15mm form factor is available in capacities of 1.6, 2, and 3.2TB. The DC P4600 in HHHL AIC form factor is available in capacities of 2 and 4TB. The DC P4600 is rated for 2.9 DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day) and is warranted for 5-years.   Intel DC P4600 steady-state factory specifications:     Stunning performance to say the least. Intel is upping the game, and doing it with affordable TLC flash. Recommended for You Toshiba expands its NetApp SolidFire lineup of SSDs... ADATA's new microSDXC hit 275MB/s read, 155MB/s write...

Think again. While Optane performs like some insane hybrid between RAM and solid state drives (SSD Should You Get A Solid State Drive (SSD)? [Opinion] Should You Get A Solid State Drive (SSD)? [Opinion] If you've kept up with some of the latest news about new computer parts, you may have heard about SSDs, or solid state drives. They are designed to replace your clunky, slow hard drive and... Read More ), it suffers from unbelievable problems. Don’t trust the hype: it’s a rip-off for what they’re charging. But before buying from Intel, you might first want to know what Optane is. What Is Optane and Why Is It So Hyped? Optane sold out immediately at Amazon and other online retailers. Chances are, even if you need a drive, you won’t be able to get one. But why are consumers so excited about it? The key technology behind Optane is 3D XPoint. 3D XPoint (pronounced “cross-point”) is a new kind of solid state memory, vaguely similar to a memristor. Its commercial development originated as a joint venture between Micron and Intel (Intel-Micron Flash Technologies). And true to the hype, it’s several times better than the flash memory found in SSDs. Here’s a video explaining the technology: In short, Optane is a chimera. It melds the 3D architecture of V-NAND, which lends it greater storage density, with the lightning fast latency and bandwidth of RAM. Then it throws in non-volatility, like flash memory. And like a mythological beast, its origins remain a mystery. We know almost nothing about 3D XPoint. Image Credit: Trolomite via Wikimedia And that’s why investing in the technology might not be a good idea. While it’s among the fastest SSDs around The Fastest SSDs You Can Buy in 2017 The Fastest SSDs You Can Buy in 2017 Solid State Drives, or SSDs, improve performance over mechanical hard drives (HDD). However, if you want the fastest SSD around, you need to know two things: the connector and protocol. Read More , there are 10 reasons why you shouldn’t buy early models of Optane. 1. Optane Costs a Fortune per Gigabyte The prices for the newly released 16 GB and 32 GB modules are $44 and $77, respectively. That works out to around $2.75 per gigabyte for the 16 GB module and $2.40 for the 32 GB drive. In comparison, a 960 GB OCZ TRION 150 costs $0.25 (£0.24) per gigabyte. However, all sources online have sold out of Optane. And the only way to buy one right now is through third party sellers, who are selling at a small markup. For the Same Cost, You Can Get an SSD Boot Drive For $49, it’s possible to buy an ADATA 128GB M.2 drive, the SU800. While slightly more expensive, you get eight times more storage. For $80, the 2.5-inch Kingston HyperX Fury 240 GB offers seven-and-a-half times the storage of a 32 GB Optane module. More or less, Optane’s limited capacity makes it unsuitable for use as a storage drive or a location to hold your operating system — except on a Linux-based system. And that’s another problem. 2. Optane Officially Only Supports Windows (For Now) If you use Linux or macOS, you might suffer problems using an Optane module. While Intel’s overall Linux support has been good, its Optane press releases mention nothing about Linux. In fact, all press releases only mention Windows. While you could almost certainly use the drive for Linux, that might not be advisable. Early Sandforce SSDs suffered from a serious bug in Linux which resulted in data loss. It might not be worth the risk. Fortunately, the limited capacity of Optane positions it as a cache drive, not a system critical boot drive. But that’s kind of an issue. 3. It’s a Cache Drive, Not a Complete Drive A cache drive operates in parallel with a primary boot drive. Where a boot drive stores an operating system, like Windows, a cache drive reads and writes frequently used files. For example, whenever you run a web page, the browser downloads a lot of tiny files, like images and web page code — and it reads and writes these to a cache. However, on a slow hard disk drive (HDD), reading and writing take a long time. That’s where a cache drive comes in. The cache drive handles tiny, frequently used files. When used in combination with the right software, it vastly improves performance. And while you can technically use the 32 GB Optane drive as a boot device, it’s not really designed to work as such. You don’t get the advantages of Intel’s caching software either (see Reason #5 below). 4. Cache Drives Aren’t Magical Intel’s marketing department believes Optane is a world-class accelerator for regular HDDs. What blows this myth out of the water are the performance comparisons between computers that use non-3D XPoint SSDs alongside HDDs. They are close in performance to Optane cache drives combined with HDDs. But that’s hardly the least flattering comparison. What Intel doesn’t mention is that RAM can function as a cache drive, with the right software. We refer to this arrangement as a RAM disk What Is A RAM Disk, And How You Can Set One Up What Is A RAM Disk, And How You Can Set One Up Solid state hard drives aren’t the first non-mechanical storage to appear in consumer PCs. RAM has been used for decades, but primarily as a short-term storage solution. The fast access times of RAM makes it... Read More . On desktops with spare RAM slots, it’s possible to purchase 16 GB of RAM for $50 ($6 more than Optane’s MSRP) and create a significantly faster cache drive that doesn’t suffer from wear limitations. More or less, a RAM disk makes Optane look weak in terms of price-to-performance and raw performance. And those are the most important metrics for desktop enthusiasts. 5. Intel’s Caching Software Has Serious Limitations After years of neglect, Intel finally updated its SSD caching software: Smart Response Technology (SRT). You can’t run SRT on a single Optane drive. So if you thought Windows would fit on a 32GB Optane module, you’re right. But you’d still need two drives in order to get the maximum benefit from the caching software. Image Credit: Intel 6. There’s No mSATA Option for Older Computers If you own an older computer, you’re also out of luck (or in luck, depending on your perspective). Optane only sells in the M.2 form factor. However, the M.2 form factor (pictured below) only comes on relatively newer motherboards. Image Credit: NikNaks via Wikimedia Even then, Optane doesn’t work on just any computer. There are fairly strict requirements that prevent Optane from being used on most computers. Optane Requires a 7th Generation Intel Processor Yup. Intel wants you to upgrade to a 7th generation, Kaby Lake processor. There’s no reason, either. Well, other than the fact that Intel wants you to purchase a new processor. Intel’s cache booster version of Optane requires a new Intel motherboard. There’s nothing special about Optane that would necessitate using a new motherboard. They just want you to upgrade to a — minimum — 200-series motherboard. That’s Intel’s latest. For those who might find that too expensive, the cheapest 200-series is the B250. Specifically, MSI’s B250 PC MATE (UK) motherboard. It runs for $80 on Amazon, which is a tad on the hefty side. 7. First-Generation Products Always Have Problems Like early SSDs that lost performance over time How Ultrabook Performance Degrades Over Time with a Samsung TLC SSD How Ultrabook Performance Degrades Over Time with a Samsung TLC SSD Samsung's TLC SSDs are screwing their customers! A bug with Triple Level Cell NAND memory causes performance to degrade and voids warranty early. Find out whether you're affected and get a fix. Read More or burned out in a matter of months, first-generation products (particularly those based on cutting-edge technology) often suffer from teething problems. Optane doesn’t seem to differ much. The earlier enterprise SSD based on Optane, the P4800X, doesn’t possess uniformly more performance over the highest quality single-level cell (SLC) SSDs out there. On top of that, Anandtech reported that their 32 GB Optane sample burned out during testing. That doesn’t bode well for 3D XPoint’s reliability. 8. You Can’t Use Optane on Most Laptops As Windows 10 takes up about 20–30 GB of space, even Optane’s largest 32 GB capacity can’t comfortably accommodate it. More or less, it’s not designed as a boot drive. Combine that with the fact that most laptops only provision for a single storage drive and Linux doesn’t officially (as of Q1 2017) support Optane, and you have a problem: Optane won’t work on most laptops. On top of that, according to ExtremeTech, Optane’s idle power consumption hovers around 1-watt, making it more power hungry than 10 SSDs. High-power consumption makes Optane a desktop-only part. 9. IMFT Also Means Micron The other partner in the joint IMFT project has no interest in selling exclusively to Intel’s customers. Micron almost certainly will develop a version of XPoint that works with AMD, ARM, and other Intel alternatives. Their brand for 3D XPoint is QuantX. The difference between QuantX and Optane: Micron decided to not release a first generation product and instead further refined the technology. QuantX is scheduled for release toward the end of 2017. What does that mean? Micron will likely release a range of products with better reliability than what Intel is offering in Optane. However, Micron itself doesn’t sell drives. It merely produces the memory modules that systems integrators turn into consumer and enterprise products. The two most likely scenarios are that Micron releases the components for 3D XPoint hybrid drives and drives with 3D XPoint caches. The overall impact on the market will be to dramatically shift performance up while depressing the prices of non-XPoint drives down. 10. The Price Will Come Down Just as NAND SSD prices fell rapidly within the first few years of release, so too will 3D XPoint. Unfortunately, there are only two manufacturers of XPoint modules. And until late 2017 (without delays), Intel controls the market. When Micron enters the market with QuantX in late 2017, prices should begin to decline.

Read More , which we saw last year in flash prices. Who Should Buy Optane Drives Then? Optane costs a fortune per gigabyte. It doesn’t work well with laptops. It doesn’t work with desktops older than 2016. It doesn’t work on non-Intel systems. It’s not a magic bullet for performance. It’s superfluous on an SSD-only system. So what’s the purpose of an Optane cache drive? There’s just one reason: to pressure you into upgrading your motherboard and processor to Intel’s latest. And in that regard, it fails miserably. There’s no reason to buy it unless you’re looking to get your feet wet with a cutting edge technology. Right now, only commercial users should purchase Optane. The cache drive is a waste of time. However, it’s worth noting that Intel will bundle 16 GB sticks of Optane along with certain 200-series motherboards. So if you’re in the market for a new high-end motherboard, it might be worth a look. Everyone else interested in Optane, however, should wait until Micron releases QuantX. Not only will competition cause Intel’s ruinous per-gigabyte prices to fall, Micron’s product isn’t a first-generation design. Have you purchased an Optane drive? Either way, what are your thoughts?

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About May 2, 2017 Is Intel’s Management Engine Broken? 39 Comments by: Brian Benchoff May 2, 2017 Betteridge’s Law of Headlines states, “Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.” This law remains unassailable. However, recent claims have called into question a black box hidden deep inside every Intel chipset produced in the last decade. Yesterday, on the Semiaccurate blog, [Charlie Demerjian] announced a remote exploit for the Intel Management Engine (ME). This exploit covers every Intel platform with Active Management Technology (AMT) shipped since 2008. This is a small percentage of all systems running Intel chipsets, and even then the remote exploit will only work if AMT is enabled. [Demerjian] also announced the existence of a local exploit. Intel’s ME and AMT Explained Beginning in 2005, Intel began including Active Management Technology in Ethernet controllers. This system is effectively a firewall and a tool used for provisioning laptops and desktops in a corporate environment. In 2008, a new coprocessor — the Management Engine — was added. This management engine is a processor connected to every peripheral in a system. The ME has complete access to all of a computer’s memory, network connections, and every peripheral connected to a computer. The ME runs when the computer is hibernating and can intercept TCP/IP traffic. Management Engine can be used to boot a computer over a network, install a new OS, and can disable a PC if it fails to check into a server at some predetermined interval. From a security standpoint, if you own the Management Engine, you own the computer and all data contained within. The Management Engine and Active Management Technolgy has become a focus of security researchers. The researcher who finds an exploit allowing an attacker access to the ME will become the greatest researcher of the decade. When this exploit is discovered, a billion dollars in Intel stock will evaporate. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, the Managment Engine is a closely guarded secret, it’s based on a strange architecture, and the on-chip ROM for the ME is a black box. Nothing short of corporate espionage or looking at the pattern of bits in the silicon will tell you anything. Intel’s Management Engine and Active Management Technolgy is secure through obscurity, yes, but so far it’s been secure for a decade while being a target for the best researchers on the planet. Semiaccurate’s Claim In yesterday’s blog post, [Demerjian] reported the existence of two exploits. The first is a remotely exploitable security hole in the ME firmware. This exploit affects every Intel chipset made in the last ten years with Active Management Technology on board and enabled. It is important to note this remote exploit only affects a small percentage of total systems. The second exploit reported by the Semiaccurate blog is a local exploit that does not require AMT to be active but does require Intel’s Local Manageability Service (LMS) to be running. This is simply another way that physical access equals root access. From the few details [Demerjian] shared, the local exploit affects a decade’s worth of Intel chipsets, but not remotely. This is simply another evil maid scenario. Should You Worry? This hacker is unable to exploit Intel’s ME, even though he’s using a three-hole balaclava. The biggest network security threat today is a remote code execution exploit for Intel’s Management Engine. Every computer with an Intel chipset produced in the last decade would be vulnerable to this exploit, and RCE would give an attacker full control over every aspect of a system. If you want a metaphor, we are dinosaurs and an Intel ME exploit is an asteroid hurtling towards the Yucatán peninsula. However, [Demerjian] gives no details of the exploit (rightly so), and Intel has released an advisory stating, “This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs.” According to Intel, this exploit will only affect Intel systems that ship with AMT, and have AMT enabled. The local exploit only works if a system is running Intel’s LMS. This exploit — no matter what it may be, as there is no proof of concept yet — only works if you’re using Intel’s Management Engine and Active Management Technology as intended. That is, if an IT guru can reinstall Windows on your laptop remotely, this exploit applies to you. If you’ve never heard of this capability, you’re probably fine. Still, with an exploit of such magnitude, it’s wise to check for patches for your system. If your system does not have Active Management Technology, you’re fine. If your system does have AMT, but you’ve never turned it on, you’re fine. If you’re not running LMT, you’re fine. Intel’s ME can be neutralized if you’re using a sufficiently old chipset. This isn’t the end of the world, but it does give security experts panning Intel’s technology for the last few years the opportunity to say, ‘told ‘ya so’.

Report comment Reply Dissy says: May 2, 2017 at 1:12 pm It was likely your mentioning of coreboot/libreboot that had me thinking otherwise. In that case however, the answer to your question is: because Intel only knew about the exploit a couple days ago, which is not too long after it was discovered. One person 8 years ago saying “ME/AMT is a bad idea” is not reporting an exploit. It took Mr Demerjian finding an actual exploit in order to report an exploit.

Report comment chango says: May 2, 2017 at 10:24 am Even if you use Coreboot / Libreboot, you still need ME firmware from Intel on chipsets with an ME engine. Putting it in common HaD terms, your Skylake processor is the ARM cores in a Raspberry Pi, and the ME engine in the chipset is the VC. Once the VC has started the CPU, then it’s not necessary, but until then it’s in control of everything. Report comment Reply Unferium says: May 2, 2017 at 2:21 pm ???? So why is the entire ME firmware physically desoldered from my mainboard in my Lattitude E6400 (Albeit an old GM45 chipset with the IME pins on the ICH configured to disabled) and why do even gen 5 Dells (U-series Core-i Dell laptops, high BGA failure BTW) still have two ROMs on some of their business class with one of the ROMs labeled “IME_ROM”? I heard (aka hearsay) that disabling/enabling IME firmware requirement in modern systems is a config-bit ROM ordeal as opposed to the older electrical “leave the optional IME_VCC disconnected to disable optional IME” style configuration (GM45 + apparently 1st gen Core-i laptops/systems). Report comment Reply GNUtoo says: May 2, 2017 at 4:12 pm According to the GM45 datasheet, the ME is supposed to load its firmware from the ME partition on the boot flash. According to the same datasheet, using 2 flash chip is also possible to extend the size of the boot flash. You now have 2 flash chips acting as one bigger flash chip. In order to verify if you have a management engine firmware, you can simply dump the boot flash with an SPI programmer, and then run ifdtool -d /path/to/image.rom It will then tell you if it as an ME partition. Look at the ME partition size. Here’s a non-zero size: FLREG2: 0x05f50001 Flash Region 2 (Intel ME): 00001000 – 005f5fff And here a zero-size ME partition: FLREG2: 0x00001fff Flash Region 2 (Intel ME): 00fff000 – 00000fff (unused) Note that laptops aren’t ATX compliant, so unlike desktop computers, there is no guarantee that mistakes won’t fry it. Some usual advises: – Do it when the computer is powered off with any power supply removed. – Really respect the flash chip voltage. It’s usually 3.3v. Consult the datasheet if in doubt. – Use short wires. – Provide enough mA to power up the flash chip. flashrom.org has documentation on how to do that. Another explanation could be that it’s related to the mysterious ROM_BYPASS feature that allows, on early silicon revisions, to bypass the ME bootrom and instead load code from flash. This would probably allow free software code to run on the management engine since I’d guess that it’s the bootrom which checks the signatures. This would in turn might allow to run GNU/Linux on the ME and: – Offloads IRC clients or always on software to it – Offload tasks (email fetching) to it for better power management (when the x86 CPU is powered off or in S3 for instance) – try to understand better the hardware to have more trustworthy computers – Use it for testing coreboot more easily – Use it as an BMC on servers Denis. Report comment Reply GNUtoo says: May 2, 2017 at 3:54 pm Libreboot is a coreboot distribution that focusses on 100% free software. As such it only supports a very small subset of the machines supported by coreboot. – The GM45 chipset has a management engine. – That management engine is supposed to load its code from the management engine partition on the boot flash. – A Libreboot image consist of an image that is the same size of your boot flash, and that you flash on it, and Libreboot images don’t have any management engine firmware, in fact the management engine partition size is zero. So when using Libreboot the management engine has no way to load a firmware. – Coreboot can also make such hardware function well without a management engine firmware. The confusion you are making comes from the fact that all most/all more recent Intel architectures still require a management engine firmware. Note that, as I understand, me_cleaner, on such hardware, strips down the management engine firmware but doesn’t remove all code from it. In fact it leaves only code partitions that are used to boot the management engine in order to have the computer boot when reflashing the management engine firmware. Denis.

Report comment Reply LOL says: May 2, 2017 at 12:23 pm The IME starts before the OS loads… the utility will tell you about the firmware version, and what is enabled. If you do not want Intel’s updates, than there is little you can do to permanently patch the IME itself given parts are chip level ROM. Google CHIPSEC for a tutorial about what is available, as modules released by Intel are now available. Report comment Reply Anon says: May 2, 2017 at 12:50 pm Thanks for the info. I wasn’t aware that the IME initialized before the OS. Report comment Reply daid303 says: May 2, 2017 at 1:34 pm That’s the scary part of this thing. It’s “god”. It can access anything, everywhere.

Not so much for my own privacy but for the privacy of governments, commercial entities etc. You can almost guarantee certain countries have small teams constantly working on trying to exploit this disaster waiting to happen.

Report comment Reply Surfingtheither says: May 2, 2017 at 2:04 pm You really think its not running every second the mobo has power flowing? Even the standby 3.3v is enough to keep it running. This is exactly how the NSA spy’s on us and is the whole reason this chipset was created, plenty of other ways for an admin to remotely manage pc’s without the need for a secret undocumented chipset that we know for a fact intercepts all network traffic, all data moving between storage devices and all peripherals including webcam and mic. Report comment Reply abb says: May 2, 2017 at 5:39 pm While I agree it’s troublesome, how much can it really be doing? How much computational power does it have? Anyone worried about espionage can surely run Wireshark (on an AMD chip, or Android tablet, or Raspberry Pi, or roll their own FPGA sniffer) and see what’s going over the network. If the IME is spying, it’s almost certainly reporting back via the Internet (and/or receiving commands).

Report comment Reply Matt says: May 2, 2017 at 12:28 pm Try this, take the line “A vulnerability has been found in AMT allowing an attacker to take some control of the ME” to “A vulnerability has been found in IPMI allowing an attacker to take some control of the BMC”. Chances are the internet services you are using are running on a server which is based a reasonable recent Xeon which is probably using a Pilot 3 or Pilot 4 BMC. You are not likely to get source code for the BMC’s firmware either. The two main things I see here are that end users are largely ignorant of system management and securing their own networks (though it is probably a bit easier with enterprise tools like switches that work at higher layers of the network stack). The second is that support comes direct from Intel but must filter through an OEM who may have already dropped support for a specific product. As for getting access to ME firmware, it’s going to be on an SPI NOR flash part. There have been some projects here to access those flash parts here on HaD. There are professional tools that are pricey, but not so bad as to be completely out of reach of an individual. http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/sf100 http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/sf600 The SF100 has worked on all platforms up until the Skylake family on boards with an ISP header. IIRC, there are potentially issues if you encounter a 32MB SPI flash part. The SF600 is the safer choice for current platforms. The following 2 documents may be helpful for understanding ways to access your flash part in circuit. http://www.dediprog.com/save/617.pdf/to/AN0103%20%20On-Board%20SPI%20programming%20DediProg%20tool%20(Designer%20version).pdf http://www.dediprog.com/save/618.pdf/to/AN0106%20On-Board%20SPI%20programming%20with%20DediProg%20tools%20(End%20user%20version).pdf That’s also an easy place to find sockets if you are handy with a soldering iron and want to convert your board under test to a socketed part. With accessing the hardware to get a flash image out of the way, the next part is getting at the ME firmware. You will need to understand descriptor mode. This is the series 100 chipset datasheet and the descriptor mode info starts at 3.7.1.2 https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/100-series-chipset-datasheet-vol-1.pdf From here, you would decode the descriptor in the first block of your flash image, determine which blocks contain the flash descriptor, extract those blocks into an image, then start working on that. Research on this isn’t new. This was one of the first few results when I googled “intel manageability engine processor architecture” Secret of Intel Management Engine by Igor Skochinsky from CODE BLUE Now, maybe you made it through that wall of text and maybe you even read some of the information I posted. If you did, I hope you understand a little more about the topic of firmware in PCs and an entry point to get into research. Report comment Reply Unferium says: May 2, 2017 at 3:03 pm Will read some documents, sometimes the firmware is in the same SPI-flash (32/64M-bit types, usually as far as I have seen yet) and in separated form (2x SPI flashrom) where the IME firmware can literately be desoldered off the mainboard. I suspect more work is needed to truly disable IME, say, how Dell does it on their buisness lines with an empty IME_ROM pad and a small yellow sticker saying, “ME Disabled” However, it seems people are frightened to try pulling a ROM, backing-up data and experimenting. P.S. the Mini-PRO TL866 can be had for about $36 to some expensive $100+ for the CS (basic) model and around the same for the A model (contains ISP support, apparently) Report comment Reply Steven Clark says: May 2, 2017 at 12:41 pm If it can already be used what amount to a privilege escalation past Kernelspace and into BIOS space then yes, this whole idea is exactly as stupid as everyone said it was.

Report comment Reply Phil Maitrot says: May 2, 2017 at 2:35 pm The question for me regarding this exploit is rather: “Can this bug be used to make this stinking rathole to get the fuck out of my computer????” IME is suspected to do evil, evil, EVIL stuff. You don´t even need a tinfoil hat to recognize this. Like the article says, if you have a sufficently old chipset, you can disable IME (Or do it like RMS and use a 15 year old laptop ;-) ) Maybe now it will be possible to turn it off on current hardware? Report comment Reply Truth says: May 2, 2017 at 3:32 pm When the AMD and Intel management cores are owned, no one will hear about it until after it is replaced. That kind of information will sell for enough money to keep whoever discovers it fed for the rest of their life (or to be found dead having die from natural causes).

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Samsung could pass Intel to become the… Samsung could pass Intel to become the world’s No. 1 chipmaker By Andy Boxall — May 2, 2017 3:18 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you A shift in power could break more than two decades of Intel dominance, and see Samsung control two key positions in the tech industry. Samsung may be poised to take Intel’s position as the top chip manufacturer in the world. If it happens, it’s likely to sting too, because Intel has held the prized top spot for the last 24 years. The shift in power hasn’t happened yet, but research company IC Insights predicts it will happen before we’re halfway through 2017; but only if the recent high prices of memory chips continues. Its data suggests Intel will log $14.4 billion in semiconductor sales at the end of the second quarter this year, while Samsung will edge past it with $14.9 billion in sales. This would be up from the $13.5 billion Samsung made at the end of March, and a 4.1 percent increase over the same period last year. Intel was still ahead at the end of March, with $14.2 billion in sales. Samsung has its memory chips to thank for its prosperity, and the considerable global interest in premium, high-performance smartphones, but particularly in China. Its chip manufacturing division is its highest earner, and the combination of demand and price increases in the memory market are likely to keep it that way. At the beginning of 2017, data showed Intel had a 15.9 percent market share, with Samsung in second position with 11.8 percent, a place it has held for 15 years. Should the switch take place, it will see Samsung occupy two important positions in the industry, based on market share. Recent data from IDC shows it is still the top smartphone manufacturer, despite the Note 7’s recall last year, with an almost 23 percent share of the market. The Korean electronics giant is investing in its semiconductor business to increase its chances of toppling Intel. Following on from a $1 billion pledge on a new chip production plant in Austin, Texas, IC Insights sees Samsung spending up to $12.5 billion on similar facilities around the world over the coming year. Intel has invested $7 billion in its own Arizona factory this year, while IC Insights sees a slightly lower total investment in the industry than Samsung, at $12 billion.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Chip Stocks Benefiting From AI Somebody has to supply all of those chips that are powering current and future AI-based systems, and these three companies are a good place to start. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) May 2, 2017 at 10:21AM For all the potential scientific and cultural advances brought about by artificial intelligence (AI), it is the humble silicon chip that makes it all possible. Sure, there was the confluence of big data, cloud computing, and the right algorithms, but without the underlying CPUs and GPUs, none of this would have occurred. With artificial intelligence still in its infancy, there are opportunities for investors to benefit from this paradigm shift that melds science and computing. We don't know who the ultimate winner in AI will be, and there will likely be more than one. What we do know, though, is that chips will be there.  Market intelligence firm Tractica estimates that chipset shipments for AI will grow from 863,000 units in 2016 to 41.2 million units annually by 2025. Two companies are currently positioned to benefit the most from the rapid technological innovations brought on by AI, with one more to watch: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). NVIDIA DGX-1 AI supercomputer in a box. Image source: NVIDIA.  Leading the charge NVIDIA leveraged its position in the AI revolution by having the right tool for the job when AI came calling. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) can handle large numbers of basic mathematical calculations simultaneously. The way these chips processed graphics and AI math calculations was strikingly similar and gave NVIDIA a lead in the space. The computationally intense training of AI systems is still primarily the domain of GPUs, and NVIDIA sits firmly in the lead. In 2016, NVIDIA grew its revenue 38% over the prior year to a record $6.91 billion and increased earnings per share by 138%. In its most recent quarter, data center revenue, where its AI chip business is housed, more than tripled over the prior-year quarter to 14% of the company's revenue. The stock price mirrored its financial performance with the stock up 230% for 2016.  Intel held its "AI Day: Unleashing the Next Wave" to lay out its vision for AI. Image source: Intel. Intel (acquisitions) inside Intel has designs on the AI space, and the company has made numerous acquisitions that place it squarely at the intersection of several emerging trends. Altera developed a field programmable gate array (FPGAs), a chip that can be customized or configured by a customer after manufacturing. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) deploys these across its Azure cloud server system for the inferencing stage of AI -- performing a function once the AI system has already been trained -- for applications such as image recognition. Machine learning start-up Movidius produced systems on a chip (SoC) designed for the computer vision systems used by drones and virtual reality headsets that reduced the power consumption of these data-intensive systems. Deep learning start-up Nervana developed an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is central to Intel's Lake Crest chip (aka, Nervana Engine), which is custom-designed and optimized for AI. Most recently, Intel acquired machine learning and computer vision company Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY), which developed cameras used in autonomous driving and software that could detect hazards or obstructions that will be central to self-driving car technology.  Each of the chips in Intel's arsenal serves a distinct function, and these acquisitions give the company a stake in a variety of applications that cut a broad path through the AI marketplace. It would be hard to gage the impact of these latest developments on future performance, but given the breadth of applications, Intel will likely thrive. AMD introduces Radeon Instinct for AI. Image source: AMD. One to watch AMD is playing catch up in the field and recently released an entire line of chips aimed squarely at deep learning AI applications. While it has produced GPUs for years, it only recently developed processors specifically for AI. AMD has a dedicated following among those looking for a "quality on a budget," and it appears to be pursuing the same strategy in AI. There are also indications that its new line of dedicated chips may seek to match or improve upon existing performance across a broad range of AI applications. AMD gained market share and rode the coattails of its larger rival with its stock price quadrupling over 2016, while its revenue grew 7% to $4.27 billion. It remains to be seen if AMD can affect a market that is currently dominated by NVIDIA. It may be able to create a niche similar to the one it carved out for itself in the gaming market.  A cautionary note While each of these companies offers a different way to play the AI market, it is important to note that the field is still in its infancy, and no one solution works best for every application. There is still the potential that someone will build a better mousetrap that will make any or all of the choices described above obsolete. Such is the nature of investing in emerging technology -- fortunes are made and lost, sometimes overnight.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Hints at Next-Gen Apple Inc. iPhone Win Comments from Intel on its most recent earnings call suggest that it'll supply chips into the next iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 2, 2017 at 10:45AM It's well known at this point that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) now supplies cellular modems into some of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, splitting the orders with wireless giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Although it is a reasonable assumption to expect that Apple will, once again, use Intel's cellular modems in the upcoming iPhone 7s/7s Plus, investors shouldn't take such things -- especially when Apple is involved -- for granted. Image source: Intel. On Intel's most recent earnings call, management strongly suggested that it will, indeed, be in the next iPhone. The trajectory of Intel's modem business Analyst Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital asked management to give its "view on [its] modem product this year and next." Krzanich said that the company's modem portfolio "continues to gain momentum." "We've talked about our one large customer," Krzanich said in an obvious reference to Apple, "but we continue to get other interest in it." Intel CFO Robert Swan added some additional financial color to Krzanich's comments. He pointed out that on a year-over-year basis, Intel's modem sales in the first half of this year will look good because the company's "large client" (Apple) "didn't ramp until the second half of last year," but that in the second half of this year the comparisons "get much tougher." Despite the tougher comparisons that Intel's modem business is set to face next year, Swan said that "given the product we have, we feel relatively good about where we are." Another iPhone win for Intel At this point, Apple has likely finalized its component supply deals for the next generation iPhone. Intel, as well as the other players in Apple's supply chain, likely know their standing in the next iPhone. If Intel weren't in the device (or at least had a strong suspicion that it wouldn't be), then I'd expect the company to warn investors ahead of time. Unless something goes seriously wrong with Intel's upcoming modem, known as the XMM 7480, it's a pretty safe bet that Intel will be inside yet another generation of iPhone. That's obviously good news for Intel, as it should not only benefit from the ramp-up of the next generation iPhone models, but Intel will be able to gain share because the iPhone 7/7 Plus should become Apple's mid-range product line. Intel isn't inside Apple's current mid-range product line -- the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus -- so this is upside for Intel. And, of course, when Intel wins at Apple, it happens at the expense of Qualcomm's own stand-alone modem business. Unlike Intel's wireless chip business, Qualcomm's smartphone chip business doesn't heavily depend on Apple (Qualcomm supplies chips to a wide range of phone vendors, large and small), so this share loss -- though clearly not desirable from Qualcomm's point of view -- isn't going to be a game changer either way. Looking ahead With Intel's place in the iPhone seemingly secure for now, it'll be interesting to see what other business Intel can potentially get with its stand-alone modems. Remember that most smartphones today use integrated cellular modem/applications processor solutions, so it's hard to imagine that the non-Apple addressable market for stand-alone modems -- at least in the world of smartphones -- is all that large. Where I could see possible success for Intel's stand-alone modems are in laptops and 2-in-1 Windows devices that require cellular connectivity. I could also see a company like LG, which is an Intel Custom Foundry customer for a high-end applications processor, pair an Intel modem with that applications processor for a select set of handsets. Again, I don't have high expectations for Intel's stand-alone modems outside of Apple, but I nonetheless am interested to see what kind of incremental success Intel can find with its modem products.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Excitement builds as 5G nears commercial deployment 0 By Asha Keddy, Intel VP, communication and devices group and general manager, next generation and standards on May 1, 2017 Opinion Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) “Are we there yet?” It’s a familiar refrain for anyone who’s ever had the pleasure of taking a family road trip. Excitement, suspense, impatience, expectation—all packed into four little words. As we approach 5G deployment and the commercialization of 5G use cases like autonomous driving, it’s hard not to see the parallels. For many, even the most experienced of us, anticipation is mounting, as the wondrous capabilities of 5G near actualization – enabling the fully connected, mobile intelligent society. Reaching our destination will require tight ecosystem collaboration, interdisciplinary connections, rapid innovation, and agile iteration across the industry on universal standards; new radio specifications; network transformation requirements; harmonized spectral ranges, and viable reference designs for field trials and testing. And, as our CEO says, “data is the new oil,” that will power our forward momentum. In March I had the opportunity to explore some of the milestones Intel is driving during a plenary entitled, “5G Moving Towards Deployment” at the IEEE WCNC ’17 conference in San Francisco: Universal standards Intel participates in more than 250 standards and industry groups worldwide, with leading positions in the 3GPP and IEEE, as well as active participation in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Through leadership in standard-setting organizations—Intel is working to address the needs of customers the world over, delivering technical advancements and bringing interoperable solutions to market that will enable the next generation of wireless connectivity in globally-harmonized spectral ranges. At Mobile World Congress 2017’s Global Test Summit, Intel, AT&T, China Mobile, NTT DOCOMO, Vodafone, Ericsson, Huawei, Keysight, Nokia, Qualcomm, R&S, and ZTE announced a joint commitment to promote a unified 3GPP standard for a global 5G ecosystem via testing, trials, and cooperation. Together, we’re working on completing a high-quality and competitive 5G specification by June 2018 for 3GPP Rel-15 and by December 2019 for Rel-16, built with forward compatibility in mind. Meeting 5G requirements will require both sub 6 GHz and mmWave bands for multi-Gbps throughout, hundreds of MHz aggregated bandwidth, and ultra-low latency will necessitate radio access to wide bandwidth in the 28 GHz and mmWave spectral ranges. Network transformation 5G will see explosive growth in the number of connected devices and demands on the network—as more than 50 billion smart devices and “things” are enabled with communications capabilities and computing power. Supporting these devices, as well as the needs of other usage scenarios, will require a network transformation of massive scale. Purpose-built networks must become software-defined, virtualized and heterogeneous. Intel is powering the cloud-ready network, facilitating the fast deployment of SDN and NFV solutions and services via the Intel® Open Network Platform. Intel architecture-based components are enabling communications service providers to prepare their networks for 5G solutions and services, while simultaneously future-proofing their investments—replacing fixed-function appliances with virtualized workflows built on open standards, both in the radio and core network. Additionally, teams within Intel are teaming up in a new NFV Laboratory Initiative to assist operators with the transition to virtualized environments and accelerate the delivery of business value. Spectral harmonization Shifting from a paradigm focused almost exclusively on mobile broadband to one designed to bring both seamless connectivity and massive computing power to each thing, person, and use case will require the industry to explore new ways of utilizing spectrum. This means developing new standards that optimize the use of licensed and licensed shared bands while also operationalizing unlicensed bands to meet the unique needs of IoT, eMBB, and URLLC applications. Accelerating the delivery of 5G products and services depends on harmonizing spectrum frequency ranges across leading geographies to achieve economies of scale for both manufacturers and operators. The industry must align around sub-1 GHz spectrum for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) use cases like IoT; sub-6 GHz for mobile broadband coverage and capacity; and 28 GHz+ mmWave ranges for bandwidth-intensive applications, including virtual reality. Field trials and testing Of course, the launch of 5G commercial solutions is completely dependent on our ability to rapidly test and iterate on all the above—emerging standards, radio technologies, and network capabilities—in field trials. It was barely over a year ago that we were announcing the 1st Generation Intel Mobile Trial Platform at MWC 2016. This year, we announced the 3rd Generation of the platform, as well as a host of advancements achieved with its support—including the launch of the Intel GO Automotive 5G Platform, featuring 4G LTE and 5G 28 GHz operation for V2V and V2E connectivity. Intel’s Mobile Trial Platform is also behind two exciting new fixed access trials with Nokia and AT&T, which are predicted to accelerate the commercial availability of mmWave-capable 5G solutions. This week, I had the opportunity to cover these topics in more depth at the IEEE’s Wireless Networking and Communications Conference in San Francisco, where we had a focused conversation on the importance of fostering diversity and inclusion in communications engineering. As we near the arrival of 5G, I am filled with anticipation and excitement, not just about the prospects of 5G, but at the opportunity to take this journey with a strong, powerful, and diverse team, at a company committed to inclusion. Recently, Intel set an ambitious goal to be the first high-tech company to reach full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce by 2020. And the company committed $300M to support this goal—not just at Intel, but across the technology industry. Intel believes that we succeed, together. From our internal teams to the partnerships we choose, to the change we drive in the industry and in the world—success is a destination we reach together. And I’m excited to get “there,” with Intel, and with all of you. Are we there yet?

Since 2008 Intel's business-focussed PC processors have shipped with Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) features - all useful features for remote management. However, these powerful features could be accessed by anyone with a copy of Metasploit on the same network, or from anywhere in the world if port 16992 was left accessible. A firmware patch has been released by Intel, said to be capable of filling in the security holes left open by its enterprise remote management features. The 'critical escalation of privilege' vulnerability was present in firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 and allowed "an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products". Intel emphasises that the remote access vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs. If the above vulnerability wasn't alarming enough, Intel's slow response to fixing a security flaw in a security feature has drawn harsh criticism from SemiAccurate's Charlie Demerjian. The reporter explains that SemiAccurate has known about these vulnerabilities for over five years and has over this period communicated with dozens of Intel execs about the security issues - all apparently to no avail. Furthermore, it is suspected that the vulnerability is currently being actively exploited in the wild. Now there's a firmware security update - but it's not a straightforward universal patch from Intel - users will have to wait for their system motherboard vendors to create a usable update. It could be that many machines with this vulnerability aren't supported by the vendors anymore and some will never receive a fix. Those who can't find a patch/fix for their system can download and study the Intel-SA-00075 Mitigation Guide which will help you make things secure while you await updates from your vendor(s).

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search The Complete Guide to Speeding Up Your Virtual Machines By Chris Hoffman on May 2nd, 2017 Virtual machines are demanding beasts, providing virtual hardware and running multiple operating systems on your computer at once. As a result, they can sometimes be a little slow. Here are some tips to help you squeeze every last drop of performance out of your virtual machine, whether you’re using VirtualBox, VMware, Parallels, or something else. Create Fixed-Size Disks Instead of Dynamically Allocated Ones When creating your virtual machine, you can create two different types of virtual disks. By default, virtual machine programs will generally use dynamically allocated disks that grow as you use them. For example, if you create a new virtual machine with a dynamically allocated disk with a maximum size of 30 GB, it won’t take up 30 GB of space on your hard disk immediately. After installing your operating system and programs, it may only take up 10 GB. As you add more files to the virtual disk, it will expand up to its maximum size of 30 GB. This can be convenient, as each virtual machine won’t take up an unnecessarily large amount of space on your hard drive. However, it’s slower than creating a fixed-size disk (also known as a preallocated disk). When you create a fixed-size disk, all 30 GB of that space would be allocated immediately. There’s a trade-off here: a fixed-size disk uses more space on your hard disk, but adding new files to the virtual machine’s hard disk is faster. You also won’t see as much file fragmentation. The space will be assigned in a large block instead of being added in smaller pieces. Install Your Virtual Machine Software’s Tools After installing a guest operating system inside a virtual machine, the first thing you should do is install your virtual machine software’s drive package—Guest Additions for VirtualBox, VMware Tools for VMware, or Parallels Tools for Parallels. These packages include special drivers that help your guest operating system run faster on your virtual machine’s hardware. Installing the package is simple. In VirtualBox, boot your guest operating system and click Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image. You can then launch the installer from the virtual disc drive in your virtual machine. On VMware, select the Install VMware Tools option in the virtual machine’s menu instead. In Parallels, click Actions > Install Parallels Tools. Follow the instructions on your screen to complete the installation. If you’re using a Windows guest operating system, it’ll be just like installing any other Windows application. Ensure you keep these updated with your virtual machine program. If you see a notification that an update is available for Guest Additions or VMware Tools, you should install it. Exclude Virtual Machine Directories In Your Antivirus RELATED ARTICLE Antivirus Slowing Your PC Down? Maybe You Should Use Exclusions Your computer’s antivirus program may be scanning your virtual machine files whenever they’re accessed, reducing performance. The antivirus can’t see inside the virtual machine to detect viruses running on your guest operating systems, so this scanning isn’t helpful. To speed things up, you can add your virtual machine directory to your antivirus’s exclusions list. Once it’s on the list, your antivirus will ignore all files in this directory. Ensure Intel VT-x or AMD-V Is Enabled RELATED ARTICLE How to Enable Intel VT-x in Your Computer’s BIOS or UEFI Firmware Intel VT-x and AMD-V are special processor extensions that improve virtualization. Newer Intel and AMD processors generally include these features. However, some computers don’t automatically enable them. You may have to go into your computer’s BIOS and enable this setting yourself, even if your computer supports it. AMD-V is generally enabled automatically if it works on your hardware, but many Intel computers ship with Intel VT-x disabled. Here’s how to enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V if it’s disabled—enable it in the BIOS, then head to your virtual machine program’s settings and make sure it’s enabled there too. Allocate More Memory Virtual machines are memory hungry. Each virtual machine contains an entire operating system, so you’re splitting your computer’s RAM between two separate systems. Microsoft recommends at least 2 GB of RAM for 64-bit Windows 7 systems, and this recommendation also applies to Windows 7 when it’s running in a virtual machine. If you’re running memory-hungry applications in the virtual machine, you may want to allocate more than 2 GB of RAM so Windows isn’t constantly swapping to disk. You can allocate more RAM in your virtual machine’s settings dialog (the virtual machine must be powered off to do this). Try to give it at least 1/3rd of your computer’s available RAM, though you can do more if you want. If that doesn’t help, you may not have enough RAM in your computer to run virtual machines at a comfortable speed. Consider upgrading your RAM—8GB should be a decent amount for most basic VMs. Allocate More CPU Your computer’s CPU does all the work of running the virtual machine and its software, so the more CPU it can use, the better it will run. If you have a computer with a multi-core CPU, you can assign more cores to your virtual machine from its settings window. A virtual machine with two or four cores will be much more responsive than a virtual machine with one, just as a computer with more cores is. If you’re using an older CPU with only one or two cores, it may be time to upgrade—your virtual machine will run much faster if you can give it at least two cores (if not more). Tweak Your Video Settings RELATED ARTICLE How To Enable 3D Acceleration and Use Windows Aero in VirtualBox Tweaking some of your video settings can also improve your virtual machine’s apparent speed. For example, enabling the 2D acceleration feature in VirtualBox improves video playback in virtual machines, while enabling 3D acceleration will allow you to use some 3D applications at a more reasonable speed. Increasing the video memory assigned to a virtual machine can speed up 3D graphics, too. Note, though, that upgrading your graphics card probably won’t do much to help your virtual machine, unless it’s really starved for video memory. Put Your Virtual Machines on a Solid-State Drive RELATED ARTICLE It’s Time: Why You Need to Upgrade to an SSD Right Now A solid-state drive is one of the best upgrades you can make to a computer for speed, and that goes for virtual machines too. A lot of people store their virtual machines on a secondary mechanical drive, since they’re more spacious, but your virtual machines will run much slower. So if you can, make some room on that SSD and put your virtual machines there. In addition, avoid placing the virtual machine’s files on an external drive unless you know the external drive is speedy enough. A fast USB 3.0 drive with good file access times might give you good performance, but an old USB 2.0 memory stick will be extremely slow and deliver terrible performance. Suspend Instead of Shutting Down When you’re done using your virtual machine, you may want to save its state instead of shutting it down completely. The next time you want to use your virtual machine, you can just double-click it to start it. The guest operating system will resume where you left off instead of booting up from scratch. This is similar to using the hibernate or suspend feature instead of shutting your computer off. Your virtual machine program saves the contents of your virtual machine’s memory to a file on your hard drive and loads that file when you next start the virtual machine. Improve Performance Inside the Virtual Machine RELATED ARTICLE 10 Quick Ways to Speed Up a Slow PC Running Windows 7, 8, or 10 Remember, you can also improve performance inside the virtual machine in the same ways you would speed up a physical computer. For example, reducing the amount of background applications and programs that run at start-up will improve your guest operating system’s boot time and reduce the amount of RAM used by your virtual machine. If you’re using a mechanical drive, defragmenting the virtual machine may improve performance as well (though this likely won’t make a difference on SSDs). Don’t neglect the standard tips just because it’s a virtual machine—virtual machines are just like regular computers! Try Another Virtual Machine Program Some people report VirtualBox being faster for them, while some report VMware being faster. Which virtual machine program is faster for you may depend on your host operating system, guest operating system, system configuration, or a number of other factors. But., if you’re not seeing satisfactory performance, you may want to try another program. VirtualBox is completely free, while VMware Workstation Player is free for non-commercial use. If you’re using macOS, you’ll experience much better performance with Parallels Desktop than you will with VirtualBox. Mac users can also try VMware Fusion, which should also offer better performance than VirtualBox. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Chris Hoffman is a technology writer and all-around computer geek.

The vulnerability has existed for almost a decade in Intel’s Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability firmware. Business customers use those services to track, manage and secure computers running Intel vPro processors, but the flaw does not affect chips in consumer PCs, Intel said in an advisory. All versions of the firmware from version 6 up to and including version 11.6 are affected, but all versions before 6 and after 11.6 are not affected. Intel advised businesses that use any of the affected firmware to check if their version is vulnerable using Intel’s system discovery utility.   Vulnerable firmware should be updated, the advisory said, but if a firmware update is not available from a company’s supplier, Intel has outlined some mitigations such as disabling or removing a Windows service called Local Manageability Service. According to the advisory, there are two ways the vulnerability could be exploited by attackers. First, an unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), but not Small Business Technology. Second, an unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability to all vulnerable versions of firmware. Read more about firmware vulnerabilities Most businesses vulnerable to cyber attacks through firmware, study shows An Android backdoor was discovered in the Ragentek firmware used in almost three million low-cost devices Fast pace of IoT firmware updates challenges developers. Intel reportedly said it was notified of the vulnerability by security researcher in March 2017, but the company was not aware of any exploitation of the vulnerability. Commenting on the severity of the flaw in Intel’s Active Management Technology (AMT), developer Matthew Garrett said only businesses that have explicitly enabled AMT are at risk. “The drivers that allow local users to provision the system would require administrative rights to install, so as long as you don’t have them installed then the only local users who can do anything are the ones who are admins anyway,” he said in a blog post. Garrett said this mean every Intel system built since 2008 can be taken over by hackers because most Intel systems do not have AMT and most Intel systems with AMT do not have it turned on. However, he said this is still “a big deal” because fixing it requires a system firmware update, and many of the affected machines are no longer receiving firmware updates from their manufacturers, which means anyone who ever enables AMT on one of these unpatched devices will be vulnerable. Garrett believes users should have full control over what is running on their systems. “Leaving firmware updates at the whims of hardware manufacturers who will only support systems for a fraction of their useful lifespan is inevitably going to end badly,” he said.

The bug is found in Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology firmware versions 6.x to 11.6. If exploited, it could give an attacker near-unfettered access to the targeted machine. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT AMT is a management tool that allows an authorized user to remotely manage a machine, giving serial access, and with the right drivers, it can offer a remote-desktop experience. Typically, AMT requires the user to authenticate with a password – but this vulnerability essentially circumvents that process, giving the keys to the kingdom to anyone with a copy of Metasploit. If the computer is on a misconfigured network where network port 16992 is accessible to the outside world, it means that anyone sitting anywhere in the world can take advantage of these features. Even if that isn’t the case, someone could attack it from within the network. Perhaps the most troubling facet of this saga is that the bug – which mercifully, isn’t found in consumer Intel chips – remained undetected for almost nine years. Intel has been selling vulnerable silicon for almost a decade. There must be, quite literally, hundreds of millions of computers at risk. And given the chips are used overwhelmingly on corporate machines, it means the risk those machines are holding sensitive information is amplified significantly. Charlie Demerjian, writing on semiconductor industry blog SemiAccurate said, “the short version is that every Intel platform with AMT, ISM, and SBT from Nehalem in 2008 to Kaby Lake in 2017 has a remotely exploitable security hole.” He added, “even if your machine doesn’t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network.” This is bad. As a temporary stop-gap measure, you’re best checking out the mitigation guide which Intel has released in response to this major security SNAFU. The only real fix is a firmware update issued by Intel, which manufacturers are to push downstream to users. Given the glacial pace at which computer manufacturers move, this might take a while. And if your machine is manufactured by a no-name, budget computer maker, you might as well forget about it.

The elevation of privilege bug is found in the chip giant’s Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology and Intel Standard Manageability firmware. That means consumer machines are off the hook. However, businesses with machines running vPro use those products to remotely manage their computers. The vulnerability in question – CVE-2017-5689 – is said to “allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products.” Intel explained in its advisory: “There are two ways this vulnerability may be accessed please note that Intel Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to the first issue. An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology (SBT). CVSSv3 8.4 High /AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.” The affected products are versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability.  Versions either before 6 or after 11.6 are not impacted, the chip giant claimed. The de facto backdoor has been present in the affected products for the best part of 10 years, putting millions of corporate customers at risk, although Intel claimed there’s no evidence of it being exploited in the wild. Intel explained that affected customers need to contact their OEM for the vital firmware update, and provided mitigations if a fix is not yet available. The vulnerability itself was apparently discovered and reported in March by Embedi researcher, Maksim Malyutin.

If the forecast is realized, it will be Intel's first time since 1993 losing the top spot in the global chip market. The prediction comes amid a boom in the memory chip industry. The market tracker said Samsung will continue to take advantage of soaring prices for DRAM and NAND flash chips. Computers and servers use the former while smartphones are based on the latter. Samsung is expected to post $14.94 billion (16.86 trillion won) in semiconductor sales in the second quarter, IC Insights said. The decades-long market leader, however, is expected to report $14.4 billion in chip sales during the same period. "This would mark a milestone achievement not only for Samsung, but for all other competing semiconductor producers who have tried for years to supplant Intel as the world's largest supplier," the market researcher said. "In the first quarter last year, Intel's sales were 40 percent greater than Samsung's, but in just over a year's time, that lead may be erased and Intel may find itself trailing in quarterly sales." The DRAM and NAND flash boom, however, will begin to cool in the second half of the year, according to IC Insights. But their growth potential remains solid, as the market tracker expects the DRAM and NAND flash markets to grow 39 and 25 percent this year, respectively, compared to a year earlier. Samsung will also likely unseat Intel's top spot in this year's chip sales, IC Insights said. "If memory prices do not tank in the second half of this year, it is quite possible Samsung could displace Intel in full-year semiconductor sales results as well," it said. "Presently, both companies are headed for about $60 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales." NH Investment & Securities analyst Peter Lee said prices for the memory chips will continue to soar for the time being. "Prices for DRAM in use for enterprise servers will rise further, driven by growing demand from IT giants — such as Google, Amazon and Facebook," he said in a report. "This is because they are expanding their cloud-based services, requiring massive data storage." Demand for NAND flash chips will also continue to outstrip supply, driving up prices for the non-volatile storage semiconductors, the analyst said. Samsung is a global leader in the DRAM and NAND chip markets. According to data by semiconductor market consultancy DRAMeXchange, Samsung topped the DRAM and NAND flash markets share in the fourth quarter last year with 47.5 and 37.1 percent, respectively. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter China urges citizens in N.

According to a report by IC Insights, the company won’t remain its position for much longer. Things are expected to change in the second quarter of the year when Samsung will take the number one spot away from its rival. In the April-June period, Samsung’s chip manufacturing unit is expected to post sales of $14.6 billion, which is a 4.1 percent increase when compared with the same period a year ago. Intel, on the other hand, will reportedly post sales of $14.4 billion. This means that Samsung will officially become the biggest chipmaker in the world, while Intel will be bumped down to second place. See also: Report: Samsung could acquire Taiwan’s PlayNitride for micro-LED panels 2 days ago Samsung’s great financial performance is a result of growing prices for DRAM and NAND flash chips, which are expected to rise by 39 and 25 percent this year. This means it’s quite possible that the South Korean company could post higher full-year semiconductor sales than Intel as well. Business hasn’t been great for Samsung’s mobile business last year, mainly because of the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, but the chip unit compensated with soaring results. This year, things are turning for the better across the board. The tech giant has posted its best Q1 results ever and is now on track to take the world’s largest chipmaker title away from Intel, which held it for the past 24 years.

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Samsung Poised to Become World’s Largest Semi Supplier in 2Q17 By admin in Uncategorized May 2, 2017 Intel could yield the #1 position it has held since 1993. May 2, 2017 — After nearly a quarter of a century, the semiconductor industry could see a new #1 supplier in 2Q17. If memory market prices continue to hold or increase through 2Q17 and the balance of this year, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel, which has held the #1 ranking since 1993. Using the mid range sales guidance set by Intel for 2Q17, and a modest, yet typical, 2Q sales increase of 7.5% for Samsung, the South Korean supplier would unseat Intel as the world’s leading semiconductor supplier in 2Q17 . If achieved, this would mark a milestone achievement not only for Samsung, specifically, but for all other competing semiconductor producers who have tried for years to supplant Intel as the world’s largest supplier. In 1Q16, Intel’s sales were 40% greater than Samsung’s, but in just over a year’s time, that lead may be erased and Intel may find itself trailing in quarterly sales. Figure 1 Samsung’s big increase in sales has been driven by an amazing rise in DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices . IC Insights expects that the tremendous gains in DRAM and NAND flash pricing experienced through 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017 will begin to cool in the second half of the year, but there remains solid upside potential to IC Insights’ current forecast of 39% growth for the 2017 DRAM market and 25% growth in the NAND flash market. Figure 2 As shown in Figure 3, Intel has been locked in as the world’s top semiconductor manufacturer since 1993 when it introduced its x486 processor and soon thereafter, its revolutionary Pentium processor, which sent sales of personal computers soaring to new heights. Figure 3 Over the past 24 years, some companies have narrowed the sales gap between themselves and Intel, but never have they surpassed the MPU giant. If memory prices don’t tank in the second half of this year, it’s quite possible that Samsung could displace Intel in full-year semiconductor sales results as well. Presently, both companies are headed for about $60.0 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales.

The utilization of the USB-C specification makes USB interconnects even more universally applicable, further standardizing the interface setup of SMARC 2.0 based embedded devices. System designers can use USB C for standard peripherals from USB 3.1 to USB 1.0 and – a brand new option – for connecting displays or even the power supply to the system or peripheral devices, reducing cabling efforts to a single cable. In addition, the current data throughput of up to 5 Gigabit/s in line with the USB 3.1 specification serves as a turbo charger for data intensive applications. Based on Intel® Atom™, Celeron® or Pentium® processors (codename Apollo Lake), typical applications for SMARC 2.0 designs are handhelds and other mobile devices, in-vehicle devices and stationary embedded and IoT systems with low power and high performance demands. “By introducing this universally applicable form of plug & play functionality, congatec greatly simplifies the use of embedded technology. Fully featured USB-C jacks are still rare and present a real breakthrough for standardizing the fragmented world of cable-based external interconnects. Such standardization is very beneficial for system engineers as well as system integrators, administrators and device users. System engineers don’t need to think about the interface setup anymore. They only need to specify the number of USB-C compliant peripherals they want to interconnect and design in USB-C interfaces accordingly. And system integrators can plug their USB-C compliant peripherals in any USB jack available on the board and it works. Now, doesn’t that sound fantastic? We know that we are only at the beginning of this evolution and that 100% availability of fully featured USB C jacks is still a vision today but imagine how easy system specifications will become once this transition is complete?”, explains Martin Danzer, Director of Product Management at congatec. The application ready best practice design-in of recent USB-C capabilities is shown on congatec’s SMARC 2.0 modules with latest Intel® Atom™, Celeron® and Pentium® processors and a suitable carrier board with one fully featured onboard USB-C jack for demonstrating the new power supply capabilities as well as the display integration.

If memory market prices continue to hold or increase this quarter, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel, which has held the No. 1 ranking since 1993, according to IC Insights. Using the mid range sales guidance set by Intel for second-quarter 2017, and a modest, yet typical, second-quarter sales increase of 7.5% for Samsung, the South Korean supplier would unseat Intel as the world’s leading semiconductor supplier in the second quarter of 2017. If achieved, this would mark a milestone achievement not only for Samsung, specifically, but for all other competing semiconductor producers who have tried for years to supplant Intel as the world’s largest supplier, IC Insights identified. In the first quarter of 2016, Intel’s sales were 40% greater than Samsung’s, but in just over a year’s time, that lead may be erased and Intel may find itself trailing in quarterly sales, IC Insights said. Samsung’s big increase in sales has been driven by an amazing rise in DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices. IC Insights expects that the tremendous gains in DRAM and NAND flash pricing experienced through 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017 will begin to cool in the second half of the year, but there remains solid upside potential to IC Insights’ current forecast of 39% growth for the 2017 DRAM market and 25% growth in the NAND flash market. Intel has been locked in as the world’s top semiconductor manufacturer since 1993 when it introduced its 486 processor and soon thereafter, its revolutionary Pentium processor, which sent sales of personal computers soaring to new heights. Over the past 24 years, some companies have narrowed the sales gap between themselves and Intel, but never have they surpassed the MPU giant. If memory prices don’t tank in the second half of 2017, it’s quite possible that Samsung could displace Intel in full-year semiconductor sales results as well. Presently, both companies are headed for about US$60 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales.

It usually means massive compromises in battery life, size, price, or actual gaming performance. But recent upgrades to Intel and Nvidia's CPU and GPU line-ups mean good things for the future of portable PC gaming. The Alienware 13 is one of the first VR-ready gaming laptops on the market, but even if you're not keen on VR, you'll find it a more than capable gaming laptop for just about any title you could think to run on it. What Is It? The $1999-plus Alienware 13 sits well and truly in the crowded gaming laptop space, in all its various specs and guises. That starting price gets you a machine with a quad-core Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 180GB SSD, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics all running through a 1366x768pixel LCD panel. Stepping up in spec to the $2399 model gives you a Core i7-7700HQ processor, 1080p display, a 256GB SSD and a slightly more powerful GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. The sweet spot, I think, is the $2699 model with GTX 1060 graphics and 16GB of RAM, although there's good reason to step up to the top $3599 model with a beautiful 13-inch 1440p OLED screen. The 330x269x24mm Alienware 13, heavy at 2.6kg, hides away a 76Wh nonremovable lithium-ion battery, and keeps itself charged with a (chunky) 180-Watt power brick. You might be interested to know that despite having a 13-inch display, the Alienware is quite big for a machine in its size class: because there's extra cooling to keep those toasty internal components at a reasonable temperature while gaming. There are two separate thermal systems in the redesigned Alienware 13 — one for graphics, one for processing — allowing both to work to their fullest extent without being throttled. Being an Alienware laptop, the 13 does have some cool tricks up its sleeve in addition to its powerful components and Alienware's own brand of gaming-ready industrial design cred. Tobii eye-tracking keeps the screen switched on when you're looking at it and powers it down when you're not, also making the 13 Windows Hello ready for face sign-on. And a full suite of fancy colours under the keyboard and the glass-topped trackpad — which lights up entirely when in use, which is a really cool visual effect — rounds out what really is a complete package for a gaming laptop. What's It Good At? With the top two variants of the Alienware 13 — the $2699 and $3599 models, which include Intel's most powerful mobile Core i7 quad-core CPUs and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics cards — you get a package made for mobile gaming. The 1060 is a fantastic card for a laptop, especially when it's driving smooth and stable 60fps gameplay at 1080p in most of all modern gaming titles. That i7 is more than powerful enough even in mobile form that it's not bottlenecked at all, and combined with a fast SSD and (at least) 16GB of DDR4 RAM the 13 makes for a more than powerful enough machine for anything up to and including video editing or heavy-duty Photoshop work. It's also one of the best-built laptops outside of Apple's MacBook family that I've ever used. The Alienware 13's keyboard doesn't have the most amazing key feel, but you can't deny the fact that the keyboard itself is rock solid, as is the trackpad and its bottom-mounted left and right tactile mouse buttons. The screen hinge is smooth, the screen itself has barely any flex, and the chassis of the inch-thick laptop itself is stronger than you are — even if you put effort into it, you won't be able to do any damage. This is a laptop that will definitely stand up to the punishment of regular daily use for years and years. And the Alienware 13 continues to set itself apart from the crowd with its optional 2560x1440pixel OLED screen, which at 13 inches in size is an amazingly pixel dense panel that also has the infinite contrast — courtesy of OLED's perfectly dark black levels — that makes colours practically pop off the screen. If you haven't seen an OLED display larger than the one on your Android phone, I highly recommend you search one out, because seeing really is believing. Alienware's 13-inch OLED is a pricey $600 option, but considering it's also significantly brighter and more pixel-dense than the 1080p or 768p screen options, there's a good reason to upgrade to it. Alienware's range of inputs and outputs on the 13 puts just about every other 13-inch laptop on the market to shame. With a total of two USB 3.0 USB-A ports, two USB-C ports (one Thunderbolt 3, one USB 3.0), 3.5mm headphone and mic jacks, HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet and a Graphics Amplifier port — to which you can connect a $199 Alienware box and install your own desktop graphics card. If I was buying a gaming laptop these days, I'd almost certainly go for one with this kind of future expandability; the fact that it comes with four extra USB 3.0 ports and support for extra external monitors is just an extra bonus. What's It Not Good At? The Alienware 13 is, despite its 13-inch size, not a thin and light laptop like many of its competitors are. There are good reasons for this — the long term durability that Alienware is known for is one, and a cooling system that has to adequately manage the heat output of a relatively hot 45-Watt processor and 80-Watt graphics chipset, alongside RAM and SSD and other components is another. But those combine to create a laptop that weighs 2.6kg and is over an inch thick. If you're looking for thin and light, the 14-inch Razer Blade is 6mm thinner and weighs 800 grams less at around that same $2500 price point. One thing you don't get with the 13 despite its size is a removable battery. And that's understandable — nonremovable batteries can be larger and charge faster — but it does also mean that if you want to game while you're out and about, you'd better have that 180-Watt power adapter, chunky as it is, with you. No matter how good the Alienware 13's battery life is, and it's really quite good all things considered, gaming is going to chew through those precious joules no matter what. A removable battery would have made the Alienware 13 a little more convenient; because it's not a USB-C machine, too, Dell's portable power banks aren't an option. Alienware machines have always divided the PC gaming public with their looks. Are they avant garde, or are they just a bit ugly? I happen to think that the Alienware 13 is quite an attractive machine in its way — with its matte rubberised surfaces and sturdy metallic lid — but there are more straight-up sexy gaming laptops out there from the likes of Aorus and Razer. My main complaint with the 13 is that it just doesn't really have any right angles in its design; everything is an obtuse angle. I mean, it's fine, but I would have liked the Alienware 13 just a little bit more if it was a little bit more squared off. And it doesn't matter one bit to me at all, but if you're paying $2000 for a high-end laptop that you expect to use for several years you might be disappointed to find out that only the top-spec OLED screen option is touch-capable. It, too, is the brightest of the three screen options; the $1999 spec has a relatively low-brightness 768p 200-nit panel, so I'd always opt for at least the $2399 option and probably the $2699 which pairs a brighter 1080p 300-nit panel with a GTX 1060. This combo, which I tested for a month during this review, never felt low-res or not bright enough for everyday use while in the office, at home and out and about. Should You Buy It? What the Alienware 13 mainly brings to the table for its relatively high asking price is build quality that can't be matched by any laptop without an Apple logo on it. Once you add in the fact that the Alienware rig is built for gaming, not general purpose computing like the MacBook Pro line, you have a machine that really is worth investing in: something that lasts for a long time, and remains a powerful and capable piece of hardware for the entire time. Friend of the site Junglist has an Alienware 13 that's more than a few years old and still in good nick, so that speaks volumes about Alienware and Dell's build quality. The big drawcard of the current Alienware 13 is its high-res, super-high-contrast OLED display, but even the 1080p LCD in my review unit was a good performer — and matches up slightly better with the internal GTX 1060 in terms of processing power than the 1440p OLED, although you can definitely run games comfortably at lower resolution on the higher-res display as well. My advice would always be to choose at least the GTX 1060 in the Alienware 13 — the 1050 and 1050 Ti choices just aren't going to last as long with modern titles at 1080p, making that $2700 spec far more valuable in the long run than the Alienware 13's $1999 starting price, which also uses a lower-power Core i5. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that the Alienware 13 is VR-"ready", like Alienware suggests, it does meet the minimum spec that Nvidia and HTC and other VR players suggest for immersive virtual reality content. And the fact remains that within its size class, it's one of the more powerful laptops that you can find. And, of course, if it comes to it you can always hook up one of Alienware's external Graphics Amplifier boxes and install a more powerful graphics card to increase its longevity. That also takes some of the strain off the laptop's internal cooling, which does make the machine quite warm and the fans quite loud under extended load. As 13-inch laptops go, the Alienware 13 is thick and heavy. But that has its benefits — Alienware has outfitted the 13 with a huge range of connectivity options for a 13-inch machine, for example. It's also a laptop that is decidedly not fragile. Is it an ugly laptop? That's up to you to decide. Whatever your opinion on its looks, though, you can't deny that the Alienware 13 is a powerful gaming laptop that's small at the same time and with good battery life to boot. If you're prepared to lug it around, it'll be up to the task of gaming and any other computing tasks you could ask of it, now and in the years to come. Comments soldant @soldant May 2, 2017, 5:09pm We're sort of at an exciting time for gaming laptops in that the mobile GPU variants perform much closer to their desktop counterparts than ever before. I like Alienware's solution to cooling - it's a bit inelegant but it's a gaming laptop, they're always going to be a challenge to keep cool. I actually like the idea of eGPU cages too - I'd love to have an average laptop to take out and about that docks to a powerful GPU for gaming at home. Shame Razer's Core is inferior to the Alienware proprietary solution. Reply 0 davidramble @davidramble May 3, 2017, 8:47am I hadn't heard specifics about the core yet, I understood it was the same thing but with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 instead of a proprietary port. Do you happen to know where I could find more info? Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 3, 2017, 12:15pm The Core has been out in the US for a while, there's loads of reviews of it online. It's basically a TB3 cage that jacks into a PCI-Express 4x slot - plus other USB connections that the Core provides. The Alienware GA solution is just a proprietary cable for an external PCI-E 4x slot. Both of them will reduce the performance of a desktop GPU to some extent, but it seems like the AGA has less of a hit than the Core. Since the AGA is just a PCI-E slot attached to a cable, the performance overhead is lesser than the Core with its TB3 interface (plus any other things plugged into it like USB devices). If you have a quick Google for "Razer Core vs Alienware Graphics Amplifier" you'll find plenty of forum posts comparing the two. Reply 0 Sylphier @sylphier May 2, 2017, 7:30pm Is it possible to have gaming laptops (or gaming PC in general) that is able to run AAA 3D games (actions/shooter) on high performance even after 5 years? If so, what sort of price range would that be towards? Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man May 3, 2017, 4:00pm I'd say: i7, GTX1070, 16 GB RAM. Depends how big you want it to be. 15" is a good size IMO, look at MSi GT62VR. I'd stick to 1080p panels. Reply 0 john @john May 3, 2017, 12:13pm Tick all the option boxes and you can walk away with a premium Alienware 13 laptop for $7096.32. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Intel has been the world’s top semiconductor manufacturer since 1993, when it introduced its Pentium-branded processors, which sent sales of personal computers soaring to new heights. However, the recent trends of a continued rise in prices and demand for memory chips are driving Samsung, the world’s largest memory chipmaker, to catch up with the company.  (Yonhap) “If memory market prices continue to hold or increase through the second quarter and the balance of this year, Samsung could charge into the top spot and displace Intel, which has held the No. 1 ranking since 1993,” Bill McClean, president of the US research firm IC Insights, predicted Monday. IC Insights predicted chip sales of Intel would post $14.4 billion in the second quarter, while Samsung’s chip sales would record $14.6 billion during the same period, with on-year growth of around 4.1 percent predicted.  “If achieved, this would mark a milestone achievement not only for Samsung, specifically, but for all other competing semiconductor producers who have tried for years to supplant Intel as the world’s largest supplier,” the report said. Samsung’s strong performance is driven by the growing prices of memory chips, DRAM and NAND flash, whose prices are expected to rise 39 percent and 25 percent respectively this year, due to the growing number of Chinese consumers seeking high-end digital devices. The research firm also said if memory prices do not tank in the second half of this year, Samsung could beat Intel in full-year semiconductor sales results as well. Currently, both companies are headed for about $60 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales. The Korean tech giant’s strong earnings in the first quarter were also driven by record-breaking chip sales. Its chip business’ operating profits of 6.3 trillion won ($5.5 billion) saw a 33 percent jump year-on-year, accounting for more than half of the firm’s total operating revenue of 9.9 trillion won. Experts predicted Samsung Electronics would also post record-breaking revenues in the second quarter, based on the continued favorable market conditions of chips and the rollout of the Galaxy S8. “The global demand for memory chips will continue for the time being. Samsung is predicted to post 13.5 trillion won in operating profit and its chip unit is expected to record 7.4 trillion won in operating revenue in the second quarter,” said Chung Chang-won, chief of Nomura Securities’ research center. Global chipmakers are expected to increase semiconductor investment this year on growing demand for advanced technologies including the cloud, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving vehicles. Len Jelinek, senior director of IHS Technology, said at the latest chip seminar in Seoul, “Global chip investment will increase 3.2 percent in 2017 to reach $67.7 billion.” “Capital expenditure on semiconductors will be record-breaking worldwide on growing demand for advanced technologies,” he added. IC Insights predicted Samsung would make the largest investment in chips this year. Samsung is predicted to spend $12.5 billion in capital expenditure, an 11 percent increase from last year. The company already spent 5 trillion won on semiconductors in the January-March period. “(As for the demand for DRAM and NAND flash), the adoption of memory chips is growing in all applications including high-end smartphones and the expansion of data centers. Overall, there is no possibility that the demand will drastically slow down,” Samsung said during a conference call Friday. Intel is expected to make an investment of $12 billion this year, while the world’s third-largest chipmaker TSMC is predicted to spend $10 billion.

Common profiling strategies, mainly based on instrumentation and current performance monitoring units (PMUs), are not adequate and new innovative designs are necessary. In this paper, we present the desired characteristics of what we call next generation PMUs and advocate for hardware/software collaborative approaches where hardware implements the profiling hooks and mechanisms and software implements the complex heuristics. We then propose a first design in which the hardware uses a small, yet flexible table to profile specific code regions and the software decides what/when/how to profile. This first design meets all required features and we aim it as the seed for future PMUs extensions to enable novel dynamic code transformations and optimizations.

In an advisory published May 1, Intel describes the vulnerability as an elevation of privilege type with a critical severity rating. It is found in Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM) and Intel Small Business Technology firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5 and 11.6 and can allow an attacker to “gain control of the manageability features provided by these products.” Specifically, Intel says there are two ways the vulnerability can be accessed: An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM) (CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology (SBT) (CVSSv3 8.4 High /AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). SemiAccurate, which says it has been pestering Intel to fix the issue for “literally years,” claims there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn’t at risk although Intel specifically states that “this vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs.” Intel recommends looking over this document to determine if you have an AMT, SBA or ISM-capable system and this guide to see if your system has the impacted firmware.

PACIFIC PALISADES, CA – FEBRUARY 15: during the Pro-Am at the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club on February 15, 2017 in Pacific Palisades, California. (Photo by Stan Badz/PGA TOUR) Intel continues to push forward with its virtual reality technology in the sports world. The tech giant today announced a partnership with the PGA Tour to live stream the action from The Players Championship this weekend — specifically, at the famous “Island Green” on hole 17. The company’s “Intel True VR,” its new VR brand that builds off the acquisition of virtual reality startup Voke last year, will power the stream, available to users with Samsung Gear VR headsets and the new PGA Tour VR Live app throughout the 4-day tournament that kicks off Thursday. There will be three cameras — on the tee; on the walkway; and near the green — to shuffle between. This is the first time the PGA Tour is putting on a live virtual reality production. It has tested VR technology for the past two years and demoed Intel’s True VR product at the Genesis Open in February. In March, Intel livestreamed the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in virtual reality via a partnership with the NCAA and Turner. The company continues its push into the sports world; it established its Intel Sports Group this past fall, right around the Voke acquisition, and has continued building products and services with wearable computing, virtual reality, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports industry. At its CES 2017 press conference in January, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich had attendees wear virtual reality headsets and guided them through a real-time demo of a live college basketball game, utilizing Voke’s technology to let people feel like they were actually inside the arena. Twitter is also part of today’s announcement, as those without a VR headset will be able to watch a 360-degree video stream from the same perspective on hole 17 via the PGA Tour’s Twitter and Periscope account. This is the first time Twitter has distributed live 360-degree video during a major sports event. Twitter previously partnered with the PGA Tour in January to live stream 70 hours of competition this season, which includes action from the first 60 to 90 minutes of PGA Tour Live’s coverage (pre-round analysis, interviews, range coverage, first two holes of each day’s PGA Tour Live “Marquee Groups”). Twitter said today that it averages nearly 500,000 unique viewers on the PGA Tour stream each day, more than 70 percent of which are under 35 years old. The company, which saw its stock rise after beating earnings expectations last week, continues to invest in live sports content despite the fact that it lost out to Amazon in April for the rights to stream Thursday Night Football NFL games next season. Amazon paid a reported $50 million to stream 10 games next season, five times as much as Twitter paid last year.

Gamers need them to make rich titles like Rise of the Tomb Raider hum, and some professionals, like video editors and 3D designers, need them to take the pain out of rendering huge multimedia files. For everyone else, a video card has been treated more like a luxury item than a necessary computer component. But AMD's $130 Radeon RX 550, a graphics card that costs a little more than the brand new games you'll render on it, is such a good value that it might make you rethink the notion that a graphics card is a splurge you should skip. Images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Currently available from major retailers, the circa-$130 AMD Radeon RX 550 is intended to upgrade an old desktop or function as the centrepiece of a new super cheap PC build. Though AMD told Gizmodo there were plans for a mobile version that should appear as an option in laptops later this year. The RX 550 comes with ports for DVI, HDMI and Display Port. If you're young, with dewy skin, zero wrinkles, and the ability to house six chilli dogs in a row, then you might not remember the time when every computer, no matter how small, needed a video card. Then in 2010 Intel introduced Iris Graphics, a GPU directly integrated into the CPU that does a bulk of your computer's work. Iris Graphics meant computer manufacturers didn't need to put a discrete graphics card in every computer, and consequently the RX 550's predecessors, the budget-friendly graphics cards of yore, basically died. The market today is dominated by powerful cards destined for demanding applications. AMD confused some people Monday when it announced a new series of graphics cards based on its year-old Polaris microarchitecture. You see, back at CES in January, AMD announced a new, faster architecture known as Vega. Generally graphics card makers quickly retire the old architecture when the new one arrives. So, with Vega cards expected around E3 in June, AMD's decision to potentially cannibalise those sales with some cheap Polaris cards seems silly. Besides the newly introduced RX 580, RX 570, and the RX 560 — cards that replace last year's RX 400 series, AMD announced the RX 550. It's a card with no equal — While it can't match the performance of any of the above GPUs, it beats every single one at price. The wicked cheap 550 carves out a space for AMD that hasn't really been feasible for any GPU maker in the last seven years. Intel Iris has been so good that GPU makers have never felt the need to compete for the hearts of budget-conscious consumers. But AMD has apparently changed its mind. Let's be totally clear: The RX 550 won't win any races, but it instantly makes games immeasurably prettier and faster than the discrete graphics built into an Intel processor. In our testing, we pitted it against the Iris Intel HD 630 that's integrated into the Kaby Lake i7-7700K. When playing Civilisation VI it ran nearly four times faster. When playing Overwatch, with graphics set to the most intense setting (Ultra), the RX 550 was three times faster than the integrated GPU, though the game wasn't actually playable at that setting on either the RX 550 or the HD 630: The RX 550 managed 17 frames per second, which is an excruciating experience to play, but the HD 630 was an even worse 5fps. With a frame rate that bad it's sort of like you're trying to play a game in stop motion. Higher is better for Overwatch. Lower is better for Civilizations VI and Blender. But when you drop the graphics settings to Low, Overwatch in 4K is downright playable with the RX 550, which managed a super smooth 70 frames per second. On the same settings, the HD 630 couldn't compete, clocking a borderline unplayable 28 fps. With a frame rate that low, the game gets extremely choppy — making it difficult to pull off the quick, skillful shots. The RX 550 even performed better when rendering 3D graphics for non game projects, though with smaller margins. The RX 550 rendered a big 3D file in Blender in 9 minutes and 40 seconds. The HD 630 took an extra five seconds. Good as it is, the RX 550's performance still pales when compared to the speeds you'd get with a "real" graphics card like the $500-ish  Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or new $400-ish AMD Radeon RX 580. Those cards can handle games like Mass Effect Andromeda and Rise of the Tomb Raider, which cause the the RX 550 and HD 630 to choke. The RX 550 is also MUCH smaller than the RX 580. The RX 550 is especially appealing for people building a cheap PC from scratch. It's a leg up on Intel's integrated GPU, and it is also perfect to pair with AMD's excellent new Ryzen CPU. While the Ryzen processor beats Intel on speed at every price point, it notably lacks integrated graphics. If you tack on an $130 RX 550, you'd match Intel on price beat Intel in performance across the board. And with AMD's plan to go after Intel in the mobile space, this means a laptop with Ryzen and a RX 550 inside will likely be faster than a similarly spec'd Intel device. If you're the rare person with a tower PC, or you're a builder eager to create something cheap, then the RX 550 is a good choice. And if you buy it and don't like it — no big deal— it only cost $30 more than Mass Effect Andromeda. README The AMD Radeon 550 is faster than your integrated graphics. It is slower than any other video card you could get. It is also cheaper. A solid card for first time PC builders. Will pair well with AMD's new CPUs, which are cheaper and faster than Intel, but don't have a GPU built in.

The project - if it goes ahead - would involve 3,000 construction jobs and result in the addition of about 850 full-time jobs at Leixlip in Co Kildare, according to Intel. Intel applied for planning permission to Kildare County Council last November for what was effectively a revamp of planning permission it secured in 2013. The council notes that a decision on the latest application is due today, after Intel submitted additional information back in March. The latest planning application saw the group reduce the overall size of the planned chip site by 50pc, but it would still be a mammoth 85,000 sq m (915,000 sq ft). "Intel Ireland continues to enable the site for potential development," the company told the council, noting back in November that the standard manufacturing design has evolved to such an extent that a revised plan was needed. "The planning application is part of a strategic initiative by the Intel Ireland site to ensure that the designated campus is optimised and is in a competitively-placed position to compete for next generation investment within the Intel corporation when major future capital investment decisions are being considered," planners for Intel noted. "It is a prudent measure for Intel to have flexible options available to allow them to be responsive," they added. "The revised design captures improvements in knowledge and technology." The Intel site at Leixlip occupies about 146 hectares. It currently has three chip manufacturing sites at the campus, the first of which opened in 1990. It's one of the largest manufacturing sites in Ireland, and currently employs about 4,500 full-time staff, as well as a large number of contractors. Cumulative investment at the Intel site in Co Kildare has so far reached just under €12bn. The planned expansion of the site would include a new main, three-storey fabrication facility as well as other buildings. The project has been backed by locals including former Labour TD Emmet Stagg, but opposed by others. Last year, Intel announced that it was laying off 12,000 jobs around the world. Those layoffs included jobs lost at Leixlip. The company had refused to say how many of its staff in Ireland were being let go, but it was estimated that up to 400 contractors and full-time staff with the group here had been targeted under the plan. Intel made the job cuts as it sought to tackle declining global demand for desktop computers, and refocuses its business on cloud and other sectors. Intel has chip-manufacturing facilities in Ireland, the United States and Israel. They vie with each other for investment from head office. Last month, Intel announced that it was restarting a project to invest $7bn to finish a chip facility in Arizona. It originally announced the plans in 2011, but the project was put on hold. Last week, Intel reported record first quarter revenue of $14.8bn (€13.5bn), an 8pc year-on-year increase, and operating income of $3.6bn (€3.3bn), which was 40pc higher year-on-year.

The vulnerability, disclosed on Monday, affects features in Intel firmware that are designed for enterprise IT management. Enterprises using Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology and Intel Standard Manageability on their systems should patch them as soon as possible, the company says. The vulnerable firmware features can be found in some current Core processors and all the way back to Intel's first-generation Core, called Nehalem, which shipped in 2008. They're part of versions 6.0 through 11.6 of Intel's manageability firmware. No consumer PCs are affected, the company said. Nor are data-center servers running Intel Server Platform Services. Intel Active Management Technology is a feature in Core processors that lets organizations remotely track, manage and secure whole fleets of connected computers. For example, it can be used to monitor and repair retail checkout systems, digital signage and PCs at places like stores, offices and schools. Intel didn’t provide technical details of the vulnerability, but it said a hacker could use the flaw to take over the remote management functions. In an email, Intel said it learned about the vulnerability from a security researcher in March. “We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability,” the company said. Intel said it has prepared a patch and is working with manufacturers to roll it out to users as soon as possible. Intel’s security advisory also lays out steps users can take to find out if they’re affected. For example, PCs built with its vPro technology will have the vulnerable Intel Active Management feature. In addition, the advisory has tips for what to do if there's no firmware update available from the system manufacturer. Disabling or removing a Windows service called Local Manageability Service can mitigate the vulnerability, Intel said.

Dan Goodin - May 1, 2017 11:55 pm UTC Enlarge Intel reader comments 57 Share this story Remote management features that have shipped with Intel processors since 2010 contain a critical flaw that gives attackers full control over the computers that run on vulnerable networks, according to advisories published by Intel and the researcher credited with discovering the critical flaw. Intel has released a patch for the vulnerability, which resides in the chipmaker's Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability. Business customers who buy computers running vPro processors use those services to remotely administer large fleets of computers. The bug doesn't affect chips running on consumer PCs. The chipmaker has rated the vulnerability critical and is recommending vulnerable customers install a firmware patch. In the company's Monday post, Intel officials wrote: There is an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology versions firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 that can allow an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products. This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs. There are two ways this vulnerability may be accessed please note that Intel® Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to the first issue. An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM). CVSSv3 9.8 Critical /AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel® Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel® Small Business Technology (SBT). CVSSv3 8.4 High /AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H The flaw affects Intel manageability firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for Intel's Active Management Technology, Small Business Technology, and Standard Manageability platforms. Versions before 6 or after 11.6 are not impacted. Security experts spent much of Monday assessing the real-world threat posed by the bug. A post published earlier in the day claimed "every Intel platform from Nehalem to Kaby Lake [had] a remotely exploitable security hole" that had gone unfixed for years. Researchers who parsed Intel's advisory, however, said the flaw could likely be exploited over the Internet only when Intel's AMT service was enabled and provisioned inside a network. Other researchers said the bar for unprivileged network attackers to succeed was probably lower because Windows-based software known as Local Manageability Service exposes the vulnerable AMT service through the operating system's IP address as well. "This issue is remotely exploitable through the host operating system's IP address if the LMS service is running," HD Moore, who is vice president of research and development at Atredis Partners, told Ars. "Servers with TCP ports 16992 or 16993 exposed and AMT activated would be exploitable through either the AMT's independent IP address, or in the case of LMS being enabled, the host operating systems' IP address. An attacker with access to the ports and knowledge of the vulnerability could obtain the equivalent of authenticated access to the AMT web interface, which in turn can lead to arbitrary code execution on the operating system." Moore said a query using the Shodan computer search engine detected fewer than 7,000 servers showing they had ports 16992 or 16993 open. Having those ports open is a requirement for the remote attack. That number of servers still represents a potentially substantial threat because tens of thousands of computers could be connected to some of those hosts. Enterprises that have LMS and AMT enabled in their networks should make installing the patch a priority. Those organizations that can't immediately install updates should follow these workaround instructions. Enlarge HD Moore Unprivileged network access attacks can also be carried out when TCP port 623 is open on a machine. At the moment, Shodan wasn't showing any data for that port. The above-linked blog post from Embedi, the security firm credited with discovering the vulnerability, said: "There is also a chance of attacks performed on Intel systems without Intel AMT support." The flaws in the Intel Management Engine—the technology that encompasses Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability—makes it possible for attackers to log into a vulnerable machine's hardware and surreptitiously exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators, including installing new programs. The access isn't logged by the PC because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. When AMT is enabled, all network packets are redirected to the PC's ME and from there to the AM. The packets bypass the OS completely. The vulnerable management features were made available in some but not all Intel chipsets starting in 2010, Embedi said. As indicated in Intel's advisory, a second, less serious threat is a local privilege escalation once an attacker already has low-privilege access. While not as severe as the first scenario, this threat could still make it much easier for an attacker to take control of targeted computers inside a network. Vulnerable organizations should patch as soon as practical. Developer Matthew Garrett has more information about the vulnerability here. This post was updated on 5/2/2017, 8:15 AM California time to correct details about requirements for exploitation. It was updated several times later the same day to add newly available details. Promoted Comments M@yeulC Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post And this is EXACTLY why we don't want some obscure coprocessor running at ring -2 or more privileged. AMD has a similar "feature" in its processors (PSP), and was considering letting users disable it, but I don't know where they are at the moment. You can disable Intel ME by stripping its firmware from the CPU microcode, though. 82 posts | registered 7/21/2015 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to "qwerty" and "123456," which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like "abcdef" or "letmein," or even normal words like "password" or "dragon," is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Watch: Resetting our password habits Hackers' password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called "hashes," of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it's computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker's in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a "dictionary attack." The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as "qwertypassword"), doubled sequences ("qwertyqwerty"), and words followed by numbers ("qwerty123"). © Designer491 via Shutterstock.com password.jpg Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a "brute-force attack," guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That's true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That's why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they're designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way "Every Good Boy Does Fine" reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like "freQ!9tY!juNC," which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, "freQ!," "9tY!" and "juNC," reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: "freak," "ninety" and "junk." People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don't reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It's easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the "I forgot my password" link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let's put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch "qwerty" for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you're done, go ahead and have that cake, because you'll deserve it.

 Why we choose terrible passwords, and how to fix them Megan Squire, The Conversation May 2, 2017, 8:03 PM 1,072 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sean Gallup/Getty Images The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to "qwerty" and "123456," which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like "abcdef" or "letmein," or even normal words like "password" or "dragon," is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called "hashes," of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in.

Photos courtesy of Lenovo - + Sporting a rather hefty combination of an Intel-Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM (upgradeable to 16GB), the Lenovo Yoga 910 is no doubt one of the more powerful ultra-thin hybrid laptops currently on the market. It also sports a pretty decent battery, offering almost 10 hours of use per full-charge, something that greatly enhances its purpose as a portable (1.3kg) working laptop. And yet, the Yoga 910 is also hampered by a few glaring design choices that work together to ruin the experience of using the device. While the screen, heat-management system and battery life do make the Yoga 910 an enticing offer by themselves, the device's poor trackpad and keyboard make it more trouble than it's worth in many cases. Design In terms of aesthetics, the Yoga 910 isn't too different from 2016's Yoga 900, with a clean, minimalistic, all-metal body, which -- while prone to fingerprint smudges -- actually pairs very well with the metallic watch-like hinges on the device's screen, allowing the screen to be folded back completely. In fact, the metal hinges may actually be the device's best design choice, feeling appropriately robust and solid even when the screen is folded all the way back, something that can't be said about many hybrid laptops with plastic hinges. The same isn't true for the metal body, however, as I can feel the metal plates flex -- enough to make a creaking sound on several occasions -- whenever I tried to pick the device up with one hand. Coming with a 13.9-inch screen, the Yoga 910's vibrant full-HD display (higher-end models also offer 4K) is ever-so-slightly larger than many of its competitors of the same range, thanks to its thin side and top bezels. You probably won't notice the disparity, however, as the thick bottom bezel of the screen does make the display seem deceptively smaller. This is even more apparent when you fold the screen back completely into tablet mode. Images are appropriately crisp and colourful, however, and the option for 4K resolution is something few of the device's competitors can offer, so overall the screen is probably still one of its most positive features. But while the screen can be called a step up from many of its competitors, the experience of actually using the device is made frustrating thanks to its subpar multi-touch trackpad and strangely sized keyboard. The trackpad rarely ever correctly recognises multi-touch inputs, or even mono-touch ones from time to time, forcing me to use a mouse at all times. The keyboard, meanwhile, would actually be quite usable, if not for the fact that certain keys -- most notably the shift key -- are made smaller on the right hand side, which can be more than a little frustrating since clicking the wrong key (Up instead of right shift, for example). The fact that the keyboard rests at a slight angle from the surface doesn't actually help much in this regard. The device does come with a generous amount of ports for its size, however, with two USB Type-C ports (one for charging) and a regular USB 3.0 port for you to plug in your mouse and keyboard, though that also sort of defeats the purpose of having an ultra-portable laptop in the first place. Function As is to be expected from its specs, the Yoga 910 is quite powerful for its size, able to run and switch between multiple apps without any noticeable hiccups. Its integrated Intel HD Graphics card means it won't be a gaming powerhouse anytime soon, but for the general multitasker, it definitely has enough power to spare. Powerful machines do generate a lot of heat, however, and the Yoga 910's heat-management system -- while certainly effective -- leaves something to be desired in terms of noise. Unlike many other laptops with inefficient means of heat expulsion, the Yoga 910 never quite heated up to levels that would make it uncomfortable on my lap. The trade-off, however, is the incessant buzzing noise of the device's fans, which can be heard even over the device's own speakers (at maximum), something that can definitely become annoying for you and those around you. However, this also means the device is less prone to the common issues that come with overheating. The battery life can also be considered a positive, offering a healthy 9-10 hours of use per full charge. I tested this binge-watching an entire season of TV on Netflix (about 13 25-minute episodes) with the volume and brightness set to max and had almost 30% battery left after. As a portable, ultra-thin laptop, this figure isn't bad at all. Verdict While having its fair-share of positives, the Yoga 910 is severely held back by its keyboard and trackpad, which considerably limits its practicality as a portable working computer. While my experience with the machine improved significantly with a wireless mouse and keyboard plugged in, the fact that it needs those things to become usable makes it tough to justify its almost-70,000 baht price point.

Menu Home/ Fast Forward With Dan Costa/ Fast Forward: Why Intel's Diane Bryant Does Not Fear AI Fast Forward: Why Intel's Diane Bryant Does Not Fear AI By Dan Costa May 2, 2017 10 Comments At SXSW, we caught up with Diane Bryant, EVP and General Manager of Intel's Data Center Group, who has a very optimistic outlook on tech like AI. At SXSW Interactive this year, I had the chance to sit down with a number of tech industry execs for my interview series Fast Forward, including Chris Becherer, VP of Product at Pandora; Thad Starner, Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech; and Ron Howard, director and producer of the new NatGeo series Genius. In this edition of Fast Forward, we're talking with Diane Bryant, EVP and General Manager of Intel's Data Center Group, about artificial intelligence. Read and watch our discussion below. Dan Costa: Most people think data centers are kind of boring, but you can do incredible things with them. It's also the most profitable division inside of Intel. People think of Intel as a chip company, but the data center business has exploded in recent years, and part of that is driving this AI revolution. Diane Bryant: Right. Absolutely. The artificial intelligence...discipline was founded in 1956, so we're talking a long time ago, and so it's crazy to now think about how that area has simply exploded and is transforming literally all businesses, and it'll transform the way you and I engage with the world. This has all just happened really in the 2010s, it's just really taken off. Artificial intelligence can be difficult to define. How do you define it? Artificial intelligence is a computer system with human-like capabilities, so the ability to think and predict, to learn and predict. That's the definition of it. You say, "Well it sounds pretty simple, so why did it take from 1956 to now?" The issue is in order for a computer system to be able to learn and to demonstrate some of those human attributes of learning and predicting an event, you have to feed it massive, massive amounts of data, and compute on these very very large models. It's gonna take a lot of information for a computer system to draw a conclusion. Historically, there just has not been the affordable compute capacity and storage capacity and network bandwidth capacity to actually process that magnitude of information. We'll take credit at Intel for Moore's Law, and this ever increasing beat rate of delivery—more and more technology, more capability at lower cost. Because of Moore's Law, you get to the point where you literally can compute on those massive data sets, and actually have a computer system predict an event for you. There's a processing component to it, and it's also you need the data sets to work with? Absolutely. There's the compute and storage technology that my organization's responsible for delivering, the fundamental technology into those systems. Then you need the algorithms, those predictive algorithms which is a rapidly evolving space, really a fun space, lots and lots of data scientists needed in order to keep that beat rate going. Then, you're right, there's the software...and service on top of it. It's an entire solution set that needs to come together. Intel plays in this solution set in multiple places? We do. At our heart, we're a technology company. As you noted, in the old days we were the PC company, that's our roots, our legacy. In the old days, we were the PC Magazine. There you go. Now we're much more. Now we're much more, we've all evolved to be bigger and better. We were the PC company, and now with the fact that every company is increasingly dependent upon server storage and network infrastructure, not just to run their business like the good old-fashioned IT organization was there to help businesses run their business. Now [it's] using IT services as revenue opportunities, so cloud services to augment your existing revenue stream. See, you hear about every company on the planet is going through the digitization of their company. What does it mean to be living in the world of mobile computing and cloud computing? It is definitely evolved. We've moved from the PC company to the data center company and all of the billions of things that connect into the data center. Every business is becoming a technology business. You may be a retailer, but you need to not just use these tools, but use them to innovate. Yes it is. At Intel then our responsibility is obviously to continue to serve those enterprises, their IT organizations that have the traditional IT operations, but also our responsibility is to help those companies evolve themselves to digitize, to look for new revenue streams, and new revenue opportunities based on cloud computing. An obvious easy example of artificial intelligence applied to an existing industry is autonomous driving or assisted driving moving to highly autonomous driving moving to fully autonomous driving out in 2035. That happens because you have a car manufacturer and they have now evolved to where they're going to deploy cloud services to their consumers, so I sell you the car, but then I continue to engage with you and deploy services to that car, whether it's navigation services or entertainment services or maintenance services. Those are additional services that I deploy with you, and then over time you end up being an autonomous car manufacturer, and you're now really a technology company with cars. In terms of AI, it's early days in a lot of ways, but there are AI systems available today. Can you just describe some of the best examples? Yeah, there's a lot of them. Assisted driving today, you have cars that will give you a three-point parking solution, or keep you in your lane. That's all AI solutions today. You look at the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry is rapidly deploying AI solutions. We worked with some of the biggest hospitals in China recently on an AI solution that allows the AI system to actually read your medical images to determine whether or not you have a malignant tumor. They have a significant shortage of radiologists to do that manually, when you have a population of 1.3 billion people. Out of demand, out of a true need, they've deployed an AI solution to do that first pass, and they've proven now that the AI solution is actually more accurate than the human-based solution. You have an opportunity here through AI to unleash a constraint. You're delivering an AI solution either to deliver you something you never had before like assisted driving, or to unleash a physical, fundamental constraint in the system like a shortage of a certain skillset or opportunity. It seems like a lot of the promise of AI is to break through a lot of those constraints in all sorts of different industries. In all sorts of industries. We talked this morning with a company called FarmLogs, and it was founded by two kids that grew up on farms and they looked at the world of technology and said, "How come technology hasn't come to our world let alone the farming community?" There's a huge demand, pent-up demand. The world banks will say that by 2050, the world needs to increase food production by 50 percent in order just to serve the population at that time, 9 billion people projected and to do so while the amount of agricultural land total is declining every single year. Read: Smart Farms: Big Data Meets Big Ag It's a huge challenge. You have a huge constraint, a fundamental constraint around food production, there's nothing more basic. You take artificial intelligence, you apply it to the field. Now you can aggregate data about weather and soil content and fertilization and output, yield of that acreage of land, and you can now improve upon the production of the land and help farmers get a bigger return out of their fixed capacity. It's really something that's happening globally, too. In the US, we have a certain set of problems, certain sets of issues, but when you start to scale this technology out globally, that's where it really starts to make a difference. Well, it is. You think about China as a still-developing nation, and yet they are the first to embrace next-generation technology. They don't have the legacy in many instances. They're not carrying around the way we used to do things and having to go through that change factor. They're actually bringing up solutions as computer-based AI solutions. Smart cities is another great example. They're bringing up new cities. They're bringing them up as smart cities. Let's get efficient in the way we deploy solutions to the residents in our area. Yeah, they're leapfrogging all those intermediate steps. Exactly. You see it in India as well, as they're building out infrastructure, they're going straight to wireless. They're skipping that whole generation. Once you have wireless connectivity and pervasive connectivity, there's things you can do that you couldn't do with a legacy environment. A big part of AI as you've mentioned is the ability to predict human behavior. First of all, that's where a lot of utility gets generated, but it's also where a lot users are like, "Is artificial intelligence going to know me better than I know myself? Am I going to be marketed to in ways that I can't control or predict?" Is it a good thing that AIs can predict human behavior so efficiently? I will obviously say of course it's a good thing. Again, you're stuck with a certain situation, and if you can unleash a given constraint through technology, then I would say it's a good thing. You think back really when the internet became pervasive, late 90s, early 2000s, there was a lot of concern about privacy of data, data privacy was a big big topic. You've noticed now over time that it's become less of a topic. Every time there is a revolution, and I will say AI is a revolution, just like the industrial revolution and then the digital revolution, and then the information revolution with the internet, this is the next big revolution. Any time you have a big revolution, and rightly so, people stand back and say, "What are all the unintended consequences? Should I be that excited about this?" As you see with each of those waves, nobody's looking back and saying, "Oh we should have never launched that internet thing, that was crazy." But at the time, there was a lot of concern of everyone being connected, everyone having access to data, and you can talk yourself into a situation where you're concerned. But of course there's so many positive benefits of it that just dwarf the concerns that the revolution moves on and people move with it. Today, you have conversations around AI and what could it mean from a negative perspective, if you have a rogue computer who's unsupervised, who doesn't adhere to the social norms, what will happen? You hear these concerns but it is good to have the conversations, to talk it through, and to then work through those concerns and get a positive end state, because the positive impact of artificial intelligence, the opportunities far outweigh the negatives. I think there are also individuals who feel a little bit powerless. They feel like AI is something for big companies. I definitely wouldn't agree with that, as you would anticipate I would say. That's the beauty of the cloud, as we started I said, "Why now?" One of the key technology innovations that has unleashed AI is cloud computing. Just like now, you have your phone and you have all kinds of access to apps and services on your phone, those services are delivered from the cloud. You will have AI services delivered from the cloud and it's completely democratized. Everyone has access. We were talking today to a company called Picasso, and they take these artificial intelligence to analyze an artistic style of a Matisse or a Monet or a cubist artist, and then take that style and help you develop your own art with that style. It's the merging of the two images through artificial intelligence. The democratization of AI comes with the reduction in the cost of access. Again, that's back to Moore's Law, and that continuous the decline in the cost while you're increasing the capacity of technology, it becomes democratized. The other concern people have is automation. We interviewed Vivienne Ming at CES. She's an AI expert and an entrepreneur and she builds AI engines to solve problems for people. The quote she gave me was that if you're doing the same job you were doing a year ago in the same way, she's gonna write an AI engine that will replace you. Are you worried that there's a fundamental risk to jobs when AI really comes to its own? The risk to a worker of their job being displaced by an AI or a computer system is one of those worries that comes up, absolutely. There will be some jobs certainly that are displaced though continued automation and improving the intelligence of those automated systems. But if you also were to go out and ask any company in the US what their biggest constraint is, they would say workforce. They don't have sufficient trained workforce. To your point, or to Vivienne's point I guess, your job may not be the same, but we still need you to do a job. It's just a different skilled job. The key I think for all of us in enterprise, is to continue to [train] the workforce as technology continues is deployed into enterprises. Andrew Ng, who's a data scientist at Baidu, said, "Just like the industrial revolution eliminated much of the physical drudgery for you and me, the artificial intelligence revolution will eliminate much of the mental drudgery for me." We're pulling off the low-hanging fruit of the work that can be, to your point, can be itemized, can be displaced so that we're all free to move up the stack and do the higher-value, higher-meaning work. It does mean a re-skilling. Microsoft Excel didn't put all accountants out of business; they're doing higher level work? And much more efficiently. They're more efficient. They can apply their true brain power and skills to solving the gnarly problems instead of the manual calculations. You've made them more efficient, you've made their impact to the world greater. What are those skills? If you're a 21-year-old coming out of college and getting your first job, what skills do you need? If you're a 50-year-old, your job has been eliminated through automation and you need to re-task and re-skill for the next chapter in your career. It is a technology-based skillset. We talk about the fact that you still have liberal arts colleges, kids getting liberal arts degrees, but whatever industry they go in, that industry is connected to technology in some way. It used to be that technology had permeated all industries. Now it's pervasive in all industries. That fundamental knowledge of technology, the application of technology, it's kind of like math or applied math, there's technologists, the people that are really inventing the next generation of AI solution, and then there is applied math, applied technology. You don't have to be the deep technologist, but you've got to be able to operate in an environment where there is applied technology. I want to get to my closing questions I ask all my guests. What technology trends concern you the most going forward? I have no fear of technology, are you kidding? No fears at all? Maybe I live in the Pollyanna world of everything is bright and rosy in the world of technology, but I've been at Intel for 32 years. I have seen innovation left and right. I am always amazed at what gets invented tomorrow. I live amongst 40,000 engineers who wake up the same way, thinking, "What are we gonna do tomorrow?" Nothing about technology scares me. Let's flip it and say what are you most optimistic about? What really inspires you? I am truly inspired by the application of technology and in particular artificial intelligence to healthcare. The healthcare industry has been ripe for disruption and innovation for a very long time, and now we have very tangible solutions, the impact that can be had. In my group in 2015, we kicked off an effort called All In One Day By 2020. In 2015, we said, by 2020, if you have cancer, your doctor should be able to fully sequence your genome and compare that genome sequence and all the imaging data with data from around the world. Take those results, find the matches. Determine what your disease actually is, what treatments have been applied to that, what the impact of that treatment was. Did the patient survive or not? Through that, deliver to you a personalized treatment plan, and do that all in one day. There's no reason why that can't be done. We can have a huge impact on something that's as pervasive as cancer. Half of all men and a third of all women will have cancer in their lifetime. I'm sure you know someone. My mom died of cancer. I'm so inspired by the tremendous impact we can have in curing some fundamental diseases through technology and AI. 2020 is only three years away. I'm not scared. Just letting you know. See I'm not scared of technology. I'm detecting some optimism. I am very optimistic cause you can see AI solutions getting deployed piecemeal into the healthcare industry as they're awakening. You bring that together, the partnerships we've formed with major cancer research institutes around the world, the environment is ripe for disruption. In terms of a product, a service, a gadget that you use every day, is there anything you use that every time you use it you're just like, "Wow, this is fantastic. I'm so glad somebody invented this"? The latest thing I found was my online doggy daycare. You can literally track your dog via GPS as he leaves your house and goes to daycare. A lot of information that I probably don't need... It's important to know who your dog is hanging out with. You don't want him to fall in with the wrong crowd.

By Tiernan Ray Updated May 2, 2017 4:01 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large As mentioned earlier, shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are plunging, down $3.28, or 24%, at $10.35, going steadily lower throughout today's session, and breaking below last night's after-market losses, on a disappointing outlook for gross profit margin this quarter. This was the first quarter with the company's "Ryzen" chips on the market, a milestone in its delivery of several promised products throughout this year. While some bulls defended the shares, at least one analyst cut his rating today. Srini Pajjuri of Macquarie cut the stock to Underperform from Neutral, and cut his price target to $10 from $14, arguing that Intel (INTC) may be about to hurt the company's fledging comeback. Even after the 10%+ sell-off in the aftermarket, valuation (~42x CY18 PE) still implies significant share gains as well as margin expansion, which we believe will prove to be a challenge. Intel has set the bar low for its PC segment for 2H17, has plenty of margin buffer, and will have its own new products both in PC and server markets in the coming months. Meantime, AMD's gains in the first month of Ryzen sales are disappointing thus far, writes Pajjuri: AMD appeared to have gained some share in the Enthusiast PC segment but not enough to justify the high-expectations. We believe it’s reasonable to expect additional gains in this sub-segment given the company’s minimal share. However, the window of opportunity may be closing as Intel is expected to ship its own new products in the coming months. Outside of the Enthusiast market, we see limited opportunity for the company in Corporate and mainstream notebook PC markets. (See my colleague Teresa Rivas's defense of the stock in this afternoon's Barron's Take.) To Pajjuri, in order to justify the stock price, the company needs to hit a high target of market share in server computers: Assuming AMD makes meaningful progress in the server market, we believe it can trade at about 20 - 25x normalized EPS at best (NVDA is at 27x our CY18 Non-GAAP EPS). At $12, AMD stock implies EPS power of ~$0.50 - $0.60. Even if we assume 15 – 20% share gain in the Enthusiast PC segment, AMD will still need more than 10% unit share in servers. We think it’s highly unlikely AMD can gain double digit share gain in servers without a serious price war from Intel. (See also my colleague Teresa Rivas's defense of AMD stock in this afternoon's Barron's Take.)

Tuesday, May 2, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Microsoft Surface Laptop Microsoft (Web site): Meet the new Surface Laptop. Performance made personal. Mark Gurman and Dina Bass: Microsoft has already cracked the professional and creative markets with inventive tablets and a desktop that turns into a virtual drafting table. Now it’s chasing another category many believe is Apple’s to lose: the $1,000 laptop for everyone. I would have thought so, but the lackluster MacBook starts at $1,299, the $999 MacBook Air hasn’t been updated in 785 days, the $899 MacBook Air was discontinued, and the current 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) starts at $1,499. Microsoft set out to make a laptop with better-than-average battery life because students said they wanted a device that would last through a long day of classes. The trick was to design a machine with a bigger battery that was still slim and light. Panay’s team adhered to a “fail-fast” philosophy that emphasized constant experimentation. Fancy prototyping machines were capable of spitting out mockups 24 hours a day; the prototypes were delivered to individual designers, allowing them to constantly refine the design. Working with Intel, the team shrank the motherboard, the circuit board containing a computer’s main components, to provide space for the bigger battery. Intel also helped Microsoft make the machine run cooler. Andrew Cunningham: The Surface Laptop ships with Windows 10 S, the new cut-down Windows 10 SKU Microsoft also announced today. Out of the box, the operating system can only run apps from the Windows Store, though it’s possible to upgrade it to a full Windows 10 Pro install for free until December 31, 2017. Afterward, the Pro upgrade will cost $50, the same as it normally will for Windows 10 S users. John Gruber: I, for one, don’t find it the least bit odd or surprising that Microsoft has shipped a version of Windows that’s locked to their app store before Apple has done similarly with MacOS. That’s a fundamental aspect of Apple’s dual OS strategy. Microsoft only has one OS, Windows, so if they want to ship a laptop with the advantages of being restricted to software from an app store, they have to do it in a version of Windows. I wouldn’t go so far as to state with certitude that Apple will never ship a version of MacOS that is App-Store-only, but I would bet against it. John Gruber: I can see the argument for making the OS App-Store-only by default. I can also see the argument for an iOS-style system where it’s App-Store-only, period. But charging $50 for this feels like a shakedown. It does. And I can see why this could end up being worse than choosing one or the other. But I think it might actually be a good compromise—and one I’d like to see on iOS. Fully locked down has advantages and drawbacks. So does fully open. A fee that people will think twice about, but which isn’t insurmountable, could be a good way of providing an escape hatch. Anyone who really needs it could use it, but most users won’t bother opening the door to untrusted software. Update (2017-05-02): Nilay Patel: All anyone wanted was a MacBook Air with a Retina Display, and Microsoft gave it to ’em. Ian Betteridge: Yep. Apple has failed to give people a proper replacement for the hugely-popular Air. Microsoft just delivered that. Tom Warren: “The performance on this device is absolutely amazing,” says Panay. Microsoft is using the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, and claims the battery life will last for 14.5 hours as a result. Microsoft claims the Surface Laptop is faster than the i7 MacBook Pro, and it has “more battery life than any MacBook Air on the market today.” Education iOS Mac MacBook MacBook Air MacBook Pro Microsoft Microsoft Surface Retina Windows 1 Comment 1 Comment Microsoft Launches Surface Laptop — Pixel Envy May 2, 2017 7:03 PM […] Microsoft Launches Surface Laptop […] Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

With the demise of the white MacBook, the 11″ MacBook Air is now the most affordable notebook available. I skipped the first generation of MacBook Airs due to their lackluster performance and sky-high prices.But Apple made me a believer in the MacBook Air last fall when it introduced the second generation MacBook Air. I quickly snapped up a high-end 13″ MacBook Air and it became my daily driver, replacing my 15″ MacBook Pro for most tasks. It is simply the best laptop I’ve ever used…until today. 11" MacBook Air I bought my first PowerBook 15 years ago and have owned several PowerBooks and MacBooks since. I’ve owned and used several PCs over the years, but Macs are the right tool for the job for my line of work and my digital hobbies. Below are my first impressions of the device and a few photos. We’ll be publishing a more thorough review of both the 11″ and 13″ MacBook Air soon. Update: You can read part 2 of our MacBook Air review, which focuses on the 11″ MacBook Air’s battery life. $999, $1,199 or $1,649 MacBook Air? You can of course customize a 11″ MacBook Air to your exact liking at Apple.com, but most shoppers will end up buying one of three retail models. The basic retail model costs $999 and comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 2GB of memory and a 64GB flash storage drive. For $200 more you get double the memory and storage (4GB and 128GB). The $1,199 model is the sweet spot and what we recommend for most users, especially those who are at least somewhat price-conscious. For power users and Mac fans that just want to have the best, Apple offers a $1,649 version of the 11″ MacBook Air that packs 256GB of storage capacity and features a faster processor. I opted for the $1,199 11″ MacBook Air primarily because of the 4GB of memory. Today’s computer applications take up a lot of memory and I usually have several applications open at a time. The MacBook Air line is speedy primarily because of its fast solid-state drive (SSD) and other components, not because of its processor. That’s why the 2010 MacBook Air felt incredibly fast despite having an aging Intel Core 2 Duo processor. Would I have liked the slightly faster processor and twice as much storage capacity? Sure, but not for $450. The other thing to remember is that faster processors drain batteries faster. If you don’t know why you should buy this model, you probably don’t need it. Keep in mind that you can buy a well-equipped 13″ MacBook Air for $1,599, a savings of $50 off the top-end 11-incher. The $999 MacBook Air is a good option for people who have relatively basic computing needs are will be using it as a secondary computer. With only 64GB of drive capacity, there simply isn’t enough room to store a bunch of multimedia content or synchronize devices, such as iPods, iPhones and iPads. MacBook Air Out-of-Box Experience Apple’s somehow managed to make the out-of-box experience even better. The new MacBook Air models are the first to ship with OS X Lion, the latest version of Apple’s desktop operating system. It’s even easier and faster to get up and running than with last year’s MacBook Air. 11" MacBook Air Packaging   Apple’s welcome animation is gone from account setup and only the most pertinent information needs to be entered before you can get to a functional desktop and start launching applications. You can skip registration and there’s no crapware offers or setup like we see too often on Windows PCs.  The desktop is void of any clutter and no software update reminders great first-time users. Another change from last year is that Apple doesn’t include a copy of the operating system on external media. Instead, Apple’s hidden a recovery partition on the MacBook Air’s drive that can be used to recover from a data disaster. This is a welcome move as recovery media, such as restore DVDs and the recovery USB included with earlier MacBook Air models, seem to hide when you actually need them. My 2010 MacBook Air’s recovery USB drive has been missing in action since I unboxed the thing. My Favorite Things There’s a lot to like about the 11″ MacBook Air, but here are a few of my favorites: 11" MacBook Air's Backlit Keyboard Even touch-typists can appreciate a backlit keyboard, which makes life a little easier when reaching for rarely used keys in the dark. The 11″ MacBook Air is incredibly thin and light . At just 2.38 pounds, it makes my 13″ MacBook Air feel hefty. The display is ‘glossy’, but it doesn’t have edge-to-edge glass like the 13″ MacBook Pro. This means you can actually use the thing in well-lit rooms without being distracted by reflections or your own mug. The keyboard is comfortable to use and the best I’ve ever used on a laptop this small. There’s plenty of power for everyday computing. Importing a couple of hundred RAW images from my camera card was speedy and iPhoto performs just fine. Sifting through photos and editing them is a pleasant experience. The trackpad is as good as the trackpad on the rest of Apple’s MacBook lineup. That is to say that it’s superior to what you’ll find on just about any PC. My Least Favorite Things As much as I like the MacBook Air so far, there are some things that bug me. There’s no SD card slot, which means I’ll have to carry a card reader with me when I travel or go to conferences so I can import my photos and videos. The relatively small SSD is already worrying me. Yes, I know I shouldn’t complain considering I knew what I was getting into when I bought the thing, but storage capacity anxiety is already striking me. OSX Lion is also causing minor headaches for me. I shouldn’t have to figure out how to find my hard drive. I also don’t like how Apple’s switched the default scrolling direction. 33 Responses 07/22/2011 Mishkee68 Reply You can change the scrolling action. It’s in system/track pad options. That also drove me nuts, going down it goes up? Anyway just uncheck that first box. 07/22/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply Yep, we already wrote about that preference yesterday. I’m still getting used to Lion and there are a bunch of gotchas that are fixable, but distract from the out-of-box/first use experience.  07/22/2011 guest10101011 Reply i can guess it wasn’t necessarily changing the direction it’s more if u r on this page and u were to drag the page down like it was a touch screen well you go up. lol they just forgot it’s a laptop and everyone is used to the opposite …. >< 07/22/2011 Superspringer Reply 13″ has a card slot… 07/22/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply Yes, but the 11″ doesn’t, which is the one we’re evaluating hre.  07/22/2011 Enistholmes Reply Use the iCloud for storage. Problem solved! 07/22/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply iCloud is nice, but unfortunately not the answer if your storage needs are in excess of your MacBook’s capacity by dozens or hundreds of GBs. 07/22/2011 Plushzilla Reply I really wanna own this device. I think it’s a little bit expensive but it worth it because it’s an outstanding Apple masterpiece. Application are noo-stop. Looking for iPhone apps.? Take a look at this:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rand-o-matic-the-easy-decision/id437908886?mt=8&ls=1 07/22/2011 Anonymous Reply Nice review. One minor point. You can get the Core i7 as a build-to-order option in the 11″ with the 128GB SSD for $1349.  Unfortunately, it isn’t in most stores like the $1649 model, but it is the cheapest way to get a Core i7 in an Apple notebook right now (as the 13″ only has the Core i7 in the $1699 model).  Not many reviewers are pointing this out, but I think this CTO configuration could be the real sweet spot in Apple’s lineup. 07/22/2011 Dale Strauss Reply What does the Core i7 really add to an ultralight notebook with integrated graphics? Is it truly worth the premium, or would I be better to max out storage on the SSD side? 07/22/2011 Anonymous Reply The larger SSD is probably more practical if you need to choose between the two. That said, my main point was that the 11″ was the cheapest way to get a Core i7 in an Apple notebook. As for the integrated graphics, that’s par for the course on an ultralight. Hopefully someone addresses it with an external GPU using the Thunderbolt port. 07/22/2011 Rebecca Reply From what I understand, and I could certainly be completely wrong, you can change the reverse scrolling in in settings and Apple’s new iCloud will allow you to store all of your iTune purchases as well as 5G of your own files for free. Also, wouldn’t it be easier to pack a cable for your camera, rather than a card reader? Any of that help at all? 07/22/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply Yes, I changed the reverse scrolling, but I’m willing to bet that most consumers will simply be frustrated and then get used to it rather than figuring out how to switch it. iCloud looks like it might be a nice solution for some users, but if you’re a media hog like me 5GB doesn’t even begin to make a dent. I prefer using a card reader  with my computers rather than cords because I don’t like draining my cameras’ batteries when transferring photos. Card readers are also smaller than cords. 07/23/2011 Patrick Reply If you think about it, the natural scrolling order is more intuitive than what we have been used to. I don’t think anyone would prefer reverse scrolling on a tablet for instance, and if laptops would be invented today I think natural scrolling would be the way to go.  07/24/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply That math be the case for new MacBook users, but it’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks. I was programmed to move my fingers in reverse since childhood thanks to Nintendo games. Until recently all first-person shooters and games that involved flying had controls inverted by default. Now all first-person shooters have ‘natural’ directional controls, which I can never get used to. My nephews, on the other hand, grew up with ‘natural’ controls and wonder why I have to invert the controls before I can play their games. Try as I might, I simply cannot play XBOX or PS3 games with today’s standard controls.  07/22/2011 Rebecca Reply From what I understand, and I could certainly be completely wrong, you can change the reverse scrolling in in settings and Apple’s new iCloud will allow you to store all of your iTune purchases as well as 5G of your own files for free. Also, wouldn’t it be easier to pack a cable for your camera, rather than a card reader? Any of that help at all? 07/22/2011 John Smith Reply Hi there,  Can anyone please recommend which “level” of MacBook Air 11″ I should go for, if I’m going to be using it mainly just for Garage Band. I guess NOT the base/entry level right? Any recommendations please? Thank you, Tanya. 07/24/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply John – for most users I recommend the configuration that I bought and am reviewing- the $1199 model w/4GB of memory and 128GB SSD.  You’ll definitely want the 4GB of memory if you’re a multimedia guy. The Core i7 processor may help you export projects a bit faster. But then you’re getting into 13″ MacBook Air territory.  07/24/2011 wok4 Reply Thanks for first impressions. Since I am also a photog and I am using lightroom: How about performance and maybe (hopefully not) noise from the fans? THX WOK 07/25/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply The MacBook Air is very quiet. I don’t use Lightroom as I prefer Aperture. I haven’t loaded this application onto the 11″ MacBook Air yet. If your photo library looks anything like mine you’ll probably  run out of room if you rely on the 11″ MacBook Air as your primary photo editing device. Editing photos in iPhoto is an ok experience so far, but iPhoto doesn’t tax systems nearly as much as advanced options in Lightroom and/or Photoshop. Another thing to consider w/ the 11″ is the relatively low resolution. I really prefer the 13″ MacBook Air and 15″ MacBook Pro for editing my pics.  07/25/2011 wok4 Reply Thanks. I am working on pictures mainly with a large monitor attached, only while shooting I use it to ingest photos and make a first selection. My idea is to use the Thunderbolt Display as my hub, and have only one Lightroom catalog on the Air and load the others (and the RAWS) from a Thunderbolt RAID, make my edits and exports. So I mainly use the Air 11 as a portable CPU with an emergency monitor attached. I would go for 1,8/4/256. Like the 13″, only a little bit smaller… And I fear, that the small fans will make a lot of noise while editing… Thanks anyway for your valuable input.. 07/25/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply Noise has never been an issue with my old 13″ MacBook Air or this new 11″ MacBook Air. Laptops w/ full speed processors and traditional hard drives need bigger fans to cool things off. These things are much quieter than devices like the MacBook Pros, which can really heat up.  Which monitor are you thinking of? I haven’t tried plugging my 11″ MacBook Air into my Cinema Display yet. Will post my experience soon.  07/26/2011 wok4 Reply It will be the new Thunderbolt Display. The perfect hub vor the Air: I connect my Firewire 800 RAID to the Display, also the Gigabit Ethernet and USB, an when returning from shooting I just slip in one single Thunderbolt – cable (and power), and I am connected to everything.  11″ Air: Portable CPU with attached emergency monitor… Thanks again Wolfgang 07/24/2011 Christian Ross Reply I paid $32.69 for a XBOX 360 and my mom got a 17 inch Sony laptop for $94.87 being delivered to our house tomorrow by FedEX. I will never again pay expensive retail prices at stores. I even sold a 46 inch HDTV to my boss for $650 and it only cost me $51.77 to get. Here is the website we using to get all this stuff, WildCent.com 07/25/2011 Shubho Ghosh Reply Nice review. I am planning to purchase the Macbook Air 11. I primarily use FTP softwares, html/css/php editors and photoshop. Will the 11″ suffice? Or should i opt for the Macbook Pro 13″ instead? Please advice. 07/25/2011 Xavier Lanier Reply I think the 11″ will be fine for most of what you’re mentioning. The one thing the MacBook Air may have issues with is Photoshop, but that completely depends on how crazy you plan on getting with file size and edits. I’ll try and post some demos this week of both machines w/ Photoshop.  08/12/2011 jordan Reply How is the battery life on the 11 inch Air? 12/05/2011 Tristan Inglesfield Reply 5 hours 12/01/2011 John in brisbane Reply Nice review.  I’m not an apple hater – just a little put off by the usual stuff people complain about.  These new MBAs are just superb.  I nearly bought a basic one the other week but decided on the last order screen to hold off a few months and see what happens with the ultra book PCs.  $1000 is not unreasonable either – how often can you say that about an apple product?  Soon hamburgers will be eating people! 03/29/2012 Rstrathman Reply Great review. I think the 4gb 128 ssd I5 is good for most things. excel, browsing with a 27″ TB monitor. I love the quote above” portable cpu with emergency monitor attached” lol 04/03/2012 Melivegar Reply Hi, I am a graduate student and looking to buy an 11′ MBA…I really only ever use my computer for school work (note taking & Microsoft usage) as well as web browsing…I have even gotten away with using an iPad as a sole computer for one semester! Is it safe to say the base model would be fine for me? 09/25/2012 Lizawaz Reply I am using the MacBook Air 11″ and I love its portability. I am woman and a student. I hate heavy backpacks, so the weight of this machine makes a big difference. Also, when I am on the go it slips right into my purse. I love the power of the MacBook Pro but I do not need the weight and all around largeness of it. I do like to upload pictures from time to time and I use my camera cord to connect to my MacBook Air. I also have a handful of USB drives that I use to save all my writing assignments and most pictures. I liked your comment about upgrading to 4gb if you are a multimedia person. I am not. I purchased the Air with the basic 2 gb/ 64gb flash storage, do you think this will be enough memory and storage for someone like me who will only use it to browse the web (for entertainment and research), Twitter, FaceBook, email, and to write papers?

The new SSDs are based on conventional 3D NAND and targeted at data centers. The SSDs will be used in servers or storage arrays to serve up quick video streams, voice-assistant AI responses, and even pull out information from databases. These SSDs are a reliable upgrade for those who don't want to mess with Optane, which is based on brand-new memory technology. According to Intel's rough estimate, the P4500 and P4600 drives provide two times faster read and write performance compared to predecessors, the DC P3520 and P3600 drives. The NVMe drives are not compatible with the common SATA interface. The P4600 will come in capacities of 1.6TB ($1,384) and 3.2TB ($2,589) for the U.2 form factorÂ and 2TB ($1,619) and 4TB ($3,239) for the AIC form factor. The drive has random read speeds of 702,500 IOPS (input/output operations per second) and write speeds of 257,000 IOPs in 4K blocks. The drive has sequential read speeds of 3300MBps (megabytes per second) and write speeds of 2100MBps. The P4500 will come in capacities of 1TB ($624), 2TB ($1,159), and 4TB ($2,314). Its random read speed is 710,000 IOPS and itsÂ write speed is 68,000 IOPS, which is significantly less than the P4600. The sequential read speed is 3290 MBps, and write speed is 1890MBps. These SSDs are more affordable than Optane, said Jonmichael Hands, product marketing manager at the company. The drives will be available worldwide. Intel has made tweaks that specialize the SSDs for data centers. The drivers and controllers have been improved, which boosts the speed and reliability, Hands said. The P4500 and P4600 are targeted at cloud computing but can be used for other applications. too. All-flash storage arrays can run a wide variety of applications. The main job for the SSDs is to serve as cache, or temporary storage, while applications are executed. The drives also have error correction and tools that ensure high performance and reliability. These SSDs are closely designed to work with Intel's x86 chips, particularly the upcoming Skylake server chip, which will be launched mid-year Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don't buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to "qwerty" and "123456," which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like "abcdef" or "letmein," or even normal words like "password" or "dragon," is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Play Video Sunday Morning Resetting our password habits A CBS News poll found that roughly one in four people has to reset a computer password at least once a month. And so the password process often g... Hackers' password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called "hashes," of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it's computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker's in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a "dictionary attack." The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as "qwertypassword"), doubled sequences ("qwertyqwerty"), and words followed by numbers ("qwerty123"). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a "brute-force attack," guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That's true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That's why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they're designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way "Every Good Boy Does Fine" reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like "freQ!9tY!juNC," which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, "freQ!," "9tY!" and "juNC," reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: "freak," "ninety" and "junk." People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don't reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It's easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the "I forgot my password" link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let's put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch "qwerty" for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you're done, go ahead and have that cake, because you'll deserve it.

Software can help!  CHOOSING A SECURE PASSWORD Avoid favorite sports. 'Baseball' and 'football' were often in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData's Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious.  The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile Samsung Might Become the King of Semiconductor Manufacturers in Q2, 2017 By Omar Sohail 17 hours ago 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Samsung might not have performed well financially as far as its smartphone business goes, but its varied semiconductor business that ranges from 10nm FinFET LPP silicon to DRAM and NAND flash chips has allowed the tech giant to scale new heights of the semiconductor business. The latest forecast details the dethroning process of Intel from the semiconductor business throne and Samsung looks to become the new king of this segment. Latest Statistics Reveal That Samsung’s Increase in Sales for DRAM and NAND Flash Will Help it to Claim the Number One Spot in the Semiconductor Business Samsung becoming the biggest semiconductor manufacturer in the world relies on several factors. For starters, if memory prices continue to increase through the second quarter of this year, the Korean tech giant could displace Intel, which to remind you has held the number one spot since the year 1993. Samsung’s latest financials for Q1 2017 show that the company had the second-best-performing quarter ever, with analysts claiming that had the firm garnered additional smartphone sales, the quarter could have improved significantly. Related [Update] Samsung Rolls Out Software Patch to Help Fix the Red Tinted Galaxy S8 Display According to IC Insights, Samsung has managed to gain leverage through DRAM and NAND flash sales as demand continues to aid the company’s growth. Advertisement “Samsung’s big increase in sales has been driven by an amazing rise in DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices. IC Insights expects that the tremendous gains in DRAM and NAND flash pricing experienced through 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017 will begin to cool in the second half of the year, but there remains solid upside potential to IC Insights’ current forecast of 39% growth for the 2017 DRAM market and 25% growth in the NAND flash market.” However, different analysts warn of a darker cloud approaching Samsung’s way, claiming that the company’s growth percentage is expected to increase by only single digits next year. This is due to the balance of supply and demand for DRAM and NAND flash but that does not mean Samsung will not capitalize on its AMOLED panel business, which sees continued growth as more and more manufacturers are gravitating to this technology.

Intel P-State, Schedutil Get Updated For Linux 4.12 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 2 May 2017 at 09:00 AM EDT. 7 Comments Intel's P-State CPU frequency scaling driver continues getting in shape with the latest mainline Linux Git code and the CPUFreq Schedutil governor also received some tuning, among other power management and ACPI changes vetted for Linux 4.12. For the Linux 4.12 kernel, the Intel P-State driver's sysfs interface has been reworked so it's now "more straightforward and more intuitive", P-State should now work with all CPUs advertising hardware P-States (HWP), the load-based P-State selection algorithm will now be used on a wider range of systems, there is now Gemini Lake support in P-State, and there has been other clean-ups and optimization work to this Intel CPU scaling driver alternative to ACPI CPUFreq. Overall, the P-State driver has got into much better shape the past few kernel cycles. I'll post some power/performance CPU scaling driver/governor comparisons of Linux 4.12 soon once the merge window settles down. The 4.12 power management updates also include a Tegra186/Parker SoC (Jetson TX2) CPUFreq driver, MT8176/MT817x additions to Mediatek's CPUFreq driver, and a variety of other support additions and tuning. The ACPI pull has various code changes, updates to the device enumeration code, and other work. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Forums Join   Puma 6 Flaw Lets Attackers Bog Down Impacted Modems, Gateways by Karl Bode Tuesday May 02 2017 08:31 EDTTipped by mackey Intel's busted Puma 6 cable modem chipset is the gift that just keeps on giving. We'd already pointed out how the chipset has been causing all manner of latency and connectivity issues for users, resulting in a lawsuit against Arris. And while the flaw still hasn't been fixed, users in our forums have noted another problem caused by the flaw: devices that use the Intel Puma 6 chipset can be knocked offline using a relatively trivial attack (ab)using the chipset issues. User mackey spent some time experimenting with the DSLReports cable modem Puma 6 test, and discovered that users with gateways embedded with the chipset can be taken completely offline by sending a low bandwidth stream of UDP or TCP packets to different ports of impacted devices. More specifically, users in our forums note that three to six thousand small, even zero-size, TCP or UDP packets sent to impact devices exhausts an internal lookup table in the chipset, slowly the entire device's performance as the hardware's CPU struggles under what should ordinarily be a modest load. Ironically, many of the impacted devices are advertised as next-generation products capable of gigabit speeds, yet can be completely disabled with just a small trickle of data. The attack can be conducted remotely, and impacted devices will remain offline for the duration of the attack. And again, this was on top of the performance issues already being experienced by owners of these flawed devices. It's still not entirely clear how many devices are impacted by the Puma 6 chipset flaw, but Netgear has issued a statement saying it's aware of the problem in its CM700 gateway. "NETGEAR is aware of a security vulnerability that can potentially allow an attacker to slow or stop your network access," says the company. "This vulnerability does not pose a risk for data loss or access to your network. No workaround is available at this time. NETGEAR is working to evaluate this vulnerability and will update this knowledge base article as more information becomes available."All told, the Puma 6 flaw appears to be the gift that just keeps on giving, and hardware vendors now face more pressure than ever to actually do something about it.

But for high-tech America, this quarter has been a scorcher. So what matters more? Last week saw the share price of Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft hit all-time highs. This was on the back of very strong results, with Amazon profits up 41 percent and Google 29 percent, and both Microsoft and Intel producing fundamentally strong, if less spectacular earnings. We will see what Facebook achieves when it publishes its results tomorrow, but the market expects another stunner, to judge by the surge in the share price in the past few days. Intel also traded within a whisker of its all-time high. Share this story AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File This contrast between apparently slow growth and a booming high tech business is not new. It has been evident right through the recovery, and may in some measure be associated with the swing of voters towards their new president. The elite, either on the high-tech West Coast or among the Wall Street investors who have profited from them, are doing just fine. But the mass of Americans are barely getting by, for the figures suggest that this has been the slowest economic recovery since the World War 2. The business of the US may indeed still be business, but it seems to be big business, not small.    Read also: Winners and losers in Trump's first budget plan There is no easy explanation, except to acknowledge that in part, at least, this evident dissonance between winners and losers is indeed valid. If you have a stock market boom, and the Dow Jones is up 21 percent on last year, people who own stock will do very well. The more they own the better they will have done. That leads to another debate as to whether present share values, particularly of these high-tech companies that dominate the market, are justified. At some stage there will be a market “correction” - I love that euphemistic description of what the rest of us would call a share crash - but while these companies’ earnings continue to soar you can make a decent case to support these record market levels. But the “print shed loads of money and it has to go somewhere” argument, while probably correct, is only part of it. There are, I think, two other elements at work. The first is that we are mis-measuring GDP. This is a familiar theme, the argument being that the impact of Google, Facebook and the like have greatly increased people’s real living standards in a way that isn’t captured in the statistics, partly because so many of the new services are for free, and partly because the benefits are often in saving people time. We find it difficult to put a cost on that. The other is more general. We are in the early stages of a revolution, which has been dubbed the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the early stages of any such revolution there are some obvious losers (think of blacksmiths) but many more less obvious gainers (anyone travels in a car). So now we can see the losers, people who lose their jobs from automation, but are less aware of the gainers, who comprise nearly all of us. There is a further twist. In the early stages of any such revolution there are people who become vastly wealthy - the steel and oil barons in the US 100 and more years ago are the high-tech princes now - and the widening of differentials leads to social tension. But eventually societies adapt, and that will happen again. Meanwhile, set alongside such a gigantic economic force as US high-tech industry politics seem almost irrelevant.

Check out our latest reviews and buyer's guide on the top desktop PCs for this year. The best gaming PCs you can buy in the UK By Paul Monckton | 02 May 17 Gaming is one area in which the desktop PC still reigns supreme. Consoles are great, but they simply can’t match the graphical power of the latest gaming PCs. With the right processor and graphics card, you can achieve far higher-quality visuals and enjoy all the game modifications you desire. Of course, you also get plenty of performance for all your non-gaming needs and a 3D graphics card can also offer a considerable performance boost to other applications, such as photo and video editing software. Your Buying Guide for the Best Gaming PCs in 2017 While you can go straight to the list below and buy a PC in the exact specification reviewed, it's worth understanding what to look for as each supplier allows you to customise and configure your PC to tailor it for your needs.  We'll explain what's important, and what's worth spending money on.  Virtual Reality First, though, let's briefly talk about Virtual reality (VR). It's still very niche, but you can buy an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift and play VR games on a PC.  You can read our complete guide to VR for more in-depth information on the headsets, games and apps available, but your PC will need to meet the recommended specs below. Most people don’t realise that VR games require seven times the graphics power of normal 3D games. This is because the graphics card has to deliver two different high-resolution images to both eyes at 90 frames per second. If your PC struggles to play games at 1920x1080 – the minimum is considered 30 frames per second – then it’s not going to cope with running an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive which both have a 2160x1200 screen, especially if you want 90fps (that's 1080x1200 pixels per eye). A VR-ready PC will need to have the following specifications (or better) to drive a VR headset and produce a ‘great experience’: Nvidia GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 graphics card HDMI 1.3 output 2x USB 3.0 Intel Core i5-4590 (or equivalent) 8GB of RAM Windows 7 SP1 or later You may be able to get away with a less powerful CPU, but it’s inadvisable to do so as developers are also working with these specifications to ensure games run well. And if you’re going to spend a lot on a VR headset, you really need to have a computer that’s powerful enough to run it. For more, see Nvidia's VR Ready site and AMD's Radeon VR Ready page. Processor Different games place different demands on your computer hardware, but choosing a gaming PC will involve a balancing act between CPU and graphics performance. For gaming PC’s we’re happy to allow system builders to overclock processors, which can significantly increase performance without having to stump up for the most expensive chips. The latest chips are Intel's 7th-gen Core chips and AMD's Ryzen. To keep the overclocked processors cool, they are fitted with large processor coolers, some using the traditional heatsink and fan design, while others opt for a liquid coolant pumped through a radiator. Overclocked processors place additional demands on the system’s power supply and also require better cooling, so expect to pay more for PCs with more extreme overclocking. You can overclock the processor yourself if you wish, but it can be a good idea to buy a pre-overclocked system such as the ones reviewed here which are covered by the manufacturer’s warranty when running at the higher speed. Motherboard There are several points to consider when choosing the right motherboard for your PC, if you’re not into technical details you may be tempted to overlook the motherboard and concentrate on the processor and graphics, but the motherboard is extremely important. We explain in each review what the motherboard offers in terms of overclocking. Not all motherboards support this, and opting for a lower-cost motherboard without such features can also allow you to spend a little more on your graphics card, which can have a big impact on your final performance figures. If you want the latest ports and connectors including USB 3.1 Gen 2 (which supports transfers at twice the speed of USB 3.0  - also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1) then make sure you check this before ordering. If you want to overclock an AMD Ryzen CPU you'll probably want a motherboard with an X370 chipset. However, on a tighter budget a B350 board will still give you some overclocking freedom. Graphics card It’s usually the graphics card that will determine the overall quality of your gaming experience. Once your processor is fast enough, it’s down to the graphics card to deliver the game to your screen. This is why we suggest gamers go for a mid-range processor rather than the more expensive as the difference in price will almost certainly serve you better spent on the graphics card rather than on the CPU. To ensure smooth gameplay, you generally want to achieve a minimum of 60 frames per second (fps) in your game. This is the limiting speed of most PC displays, so you won’t really need to go faster than this unless you have a high-speed gaming monitor that allows for faster refresh rates. Any extra performance will then allow you to increase the quality settings in your game, making characters sharper, textures more realistic and graphical effects more immersive. It's a good idea to go for a card from Nvidia or AMD's latest ranges. AMD's fastest card - the RX 580 - isn't as quick as Nvidia's GTX 1080 Ti, so read our graphics card reviews to find out how each card performs. It's also worth bearing in mind that it can be down to which graphics card vendor or game developer has done a better job optimising any particular game for performance. If you have an idea of which games you want to play, it can be worth investigating how well any given card performs with those particular games before you make your decision. Cases and cooling We've already talked about processor cooling, but gamers tend to like their PC tower system to look the part as well. Many come with fans that light up in various colours, but don't overlook the fact that  the case needs to be practical. Internal cable management aids airflow, while fan controllers let you reduce noise or boost cooling as necessary. Graphics cards can also come with various cooling systems, the more advanced of which can allow for faster clock speeds on the GPU and less noise from the graphics subsystem when playing games. Monitor For more immersive gameplay, go for the largest display you can find and one with a good contrast ratio. A fast response time will ensure that fast, frenetic gameplay remains free of blur, although not all game players will notice any difference. TN-based monitors will cost less and provide most of these features, but IPS-based displays will give you better overall colour reproduction and wider viewing angles, although response times tend to be slower. For a more responsive display, go for a gaming monitor with a high refresh rate of 120- or 144Hz, although you’ll need powerful graphics to supply frames at this speed. For the very smoothest gameplay from an nVidia graphics card, look for a monitor that supports nVidia G-Sync. With G-Sync, the monitor stays in step with the graphics card rather than the other way around. This means less blurring or image tearing even at lower framerates, and will be of great benefit to mid-range graphics cards such as the ones found in these PCs. AMD offers a competing technology called ‘FreeSync’, which will soon be available for displays connected to AMD graphics cards.  For more see our list of the best gaming monitors. Peripherals If you’re using your PC on a desk with a monitor, you’ll benefit from the improved responsiveness of wired rather than wireless devices. Look for high-resolution mice, and keyboards with programmable keys and backlighting. High-grade mechanical switches in keyboards have a better ‘feel’ and provide longer life than cheap membrane switches. Some draw attention to the W, A, S and D keys with a different colour or texture. Here are the best gaming keyboards. A gaming sound card can provide a more immersive experience by adding multiple sound effects, with improved audio fidelity. Also consider a gaming headset with a built-in mic. However, if you’re planning on playing from the sofa, you’ll want wireless controllers. For keyboard input, we would recommend a wireless model that comes with an integrated pointing device, such as a trackball or trackpad. Power consumption and noise If you’re using the PC as a home entertainment hub, you may also want to consider idle power consumption and noise. The more you overclock your PC, the more power it will consume and the louder it will become. Warranty Warranty terms are crucial when it comes to gaming PCs and a key advantage of buying a pre-built overclocked PC is that all of the overclocking will be tested and covered by the vendor’s warranty. The longer the warranty the better, but also look for a collect-and-return rather than return-to-base option. Also pay attention to whether parts and labour are both covered and for how long.

Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 1 May 17 RRP: £1549 Buy from Chillblast The Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 Gaming PC delivers high performance in a compact form factor, while making the minimum noise. Higher performance is available at no extra charge via an optional overclocking option, but not without compromising it’s ‘cool and quiet’ design philosophy. You won’t be expanding it with dual graphics cards, in fact there’s not much room for internal upgrades at all, but it’s also very reasonably priced for a PC of this specification. Read our Chillblast Fusion Adamantium 3 review. 2. Yoyotech BlackBox SP Rating: Reviewed on: 2 May 17 RRP: £1649 If you love bright, pulsing lights with customisable colours, then the YoyoTech BlackBox SP has got your name written all over it. If you love high-performance gaming, you’ll also enjoy the overclocked Intel CPU, Nvidia graphics and NVMe storage which combine to deliver superb performance for your money. Read our Yoyotech BlackBox SP review. 3. Overclockers UK Titan Falcon Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 17 RRP: £1260.91 Buy from Overclockers The Overclockers Titan Falcon embraces the spirit of overclocking by boosting the performance of lower-spec components to match their more expensive counterparts, but without the higher price and all backed by a superb 3-year warranty. This overclocked Ryzen 7 1700 system occasionally outperforms those based on the pricier 1700X chip and makes no sacrifices on build quality. You may wish to upgrade to a more powerful graphics card for resolutions above 1080p, but the price will remain highly competitive. Read our Overclockers UK Titan Falcon review. 4. Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen DG review Rating: Reviewed on: 1 May 17 RRP: £1675 Buy from Wired2Fire This eye-catching PC is constructed from premium components and built to a very high standard. The 8-core Ryzen 7 1700X processor delivers excellent multi-threaded performance and, combined with a GTX 1080, turns in some very impressive gaming results, however similar or better performance can be had for less money. Read our Wired2Fire Pyro Ryzen DG review review. 5. Mesh Ryzen 7 Gaming PC-A Rating: Reviewed on: 1 May 17 RRP: £1600 The Mesh Ryzen 7 Gaming PC-A is beautifully built, but ultimately flawed in its configuration. Let down by a slow SSD and a non-overclocked graphics card, yet coming with an unnecessarily expensive operating system, we feel this PC could do much better with a couple of minor tweaks to the spec. Read our Mesh Ryzen 7 Gaming PC-A review. 6. Wired2Fire Diablo Fury Rating: Reviewed on: 26 December 16 RRP: £914 & delivery The Wired2Fire Diablo Fury is a high-performance gaming PC using overclocked components which deliver good value for money. However, the lack of a hard drive means the SSD is likely to fill up quickly Read our Wired2Fire Diablo Fury review. 7. Yoyotech Warbird RS10 V2 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 December 16 RRP: £824 & delivery The YoyoTech Warbird RS10 V2 delivers high-performance gaming at a reasonable price. The lack of an SSD makes the system feel less responsive in general use, but there’s plenty of storage available for a large game library. Warranty terms could be more competitive at this price. Read our Yoyotech Warbird RS10 V2 review. 8. Chillblast Fusion Tracer RX 480 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 November 16 RRP: £749 & delivery As a great all-round gaming PC, the Fusion Tracer RX 480 will not disappoint. It delivers strong gaming performance without cutting corners, although it does lacks upgrade options. It also comes with a five year warranty. Read our Chillblast Fusion Tracer RX 480 review. 9. Overclockers UK Kinetic H1 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 November 16 RRP: £660 & delivery As a budget system with a strong emphasis on gaming, the Overclockers Kinetic H1 sacrifices multi-core processor performance, instead to sinking most of the budget into the graphics card. Photo and video editing performance may suffer a little, but you’ll be able to enjoy decent gaming frame rates up to 1440p. The inclusion of a hybrid hard drive also keeps the system responsive in general purpose computing scenarios. Read our Overclockers UK Kinetic H1 review. 10. Mesh Storm PCA Rating: Reviewed on: 28 November 16 RRP: £699 & delivery The Mesh Storm PCA performs very well for the money, but the lack of an SSD makes it less than speedy at many non-gaming tasks. A good choice for demanding gamers on a budget. Read our Mesh Storm PCA review. Tags: Desktop PCs, Games, Entertainment Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

The BlackBox SP is a multicoloured gamers delight and a hugely powerful PC to boot By Paul Monckton | 02 May 17 Specifications 3.8GHz Intel Core i5-7600K (overclocked to 4.6GHz) NZXT Kraken X52 240mm Variable Speed Liquid Cooler - RL-KRX52-01 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 3200MHz G-Skill Trident Z RGB 250GB Samsung 960 Evo NVMe M.2 SSD, 2TB 7200rpm Toshiba HDD 750W EVGA Gold 80PLUS Power Supply - 210-GQ-0750-V3 See full specs Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £1649 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers Yoyotech BlackBox SP review Perhaps the most ironically named PC we've ever reviewed, the BlackBox SPfrom YoyoTech is sure to stand out, both in performance and in looks. Finished in dazzling white with bright metallic purple accents, YoyoTech’s Intel-based gaming PC certainly looks spectacular, but under that rather daring paint job we find a selection of well-chosen components pushed to the limit in the pursuit of the highest possible gaming performance. YOYOTECH BLACKBOX SP REVIEW: PRICE You can buy the BlackBox SP from Yoyotech's website for £1649, which also includes delivery. You can also make several adjustments to the review specs by hitting the ‘customise’ button before purchase. You should also check out our list of the best gaming PCs as well. YOYOTECH BLACKBOX SP REVIEW: DESIGN AND BUILD Whether your initial response to the appearance of the BlackBox SP is one of delight or horror, you can’t dispute the elegance and space efficiency of the NZXT S340 compact mid-tower case - which is also available in a selection of other colours, including black - how boring! The NZXT doesn’t pander to the needs of legacy component like optical drives, for which no space at all has been made available. Instead, the entire front of the PC is a blank, minimalist panel of white, directly behind which sits the massive Kraken X52 High-performance 240mm liquid cooler which adds yet more razzle-dazzle to the PC’s already rave-like appearance with its own customisable RGB lighting effects. And the party doesn’t stop there: the supplied Gigabyte Aorus Z270X Gaming 7 motherboard also comes with a built-in multi-zone LED light show and even the twin DDR4 3200MHz RAM modules self-illuminate like a pair of colour-changing glow sticks. This gaming-centric motherboard offer massive upgrade potential with support for up to three-way graphics card options and triple NVMe PCIE SSDs in RAID 0 if you really want to push performance to the extreme. Of course, you also get comprehensive automatic and manual overclocking with smart fan controls built in. Enhanced “Killer” network performance and Creative Sound Core3D enhancements are also built in, along with plenty of USB 3.1 Gen2 connectors and a Thunderbird port for high speed connectivity. The YoyoTech BlackBox SP is most certainly a PC that’s screaming out for attention although, thankfully, all of these multicoloured lighting systems come with software controls so you can easily turn them all off when no-one is looking and you really need to concentrate on your tax return. You’ll be pleased to know that the BlackBox SP also has the performance to back up all of this multicoloured customisation. YoyoTech has chosen a 3.8GHz Intel Core i5-7600K quad-core processor which has been overclocked to 4.6GHz. This approach CPU sacrifices the Hyper Threading of the more expensive Core i7-7700K, which doesn’t give you useful performance gains for gaming, but gives you some extra MHz for free which saves you money that can be more usefully spent elsewhere in the system. Another great component choice here is the graphics card. YoyoTech has selected an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 for this system. Of course it’s not just any GTX 1070: in keeping with the overclocked theme of the BlackBox SP, the PC comes with an EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 FTW Gaming card which has been re-engineered from Nvidia’s original spec to allow increased base and boost clock speeds up from 1506/1683 MHz to 1607/1797 MHz out of the box. It also comes with optional automatic overclock tuning and the enhanced cooling power capacity to allow it. And it lights up in user-configurable RGB colours, so it's perfect for this PC. Some non-illuminated components are also installed, including a 250GB Samsung 869 Evo NVMe SSD, plugged directly into the motherboard and a separate 2TB magnetic drive tucked away into its own compartment, while a 750W EVGA Gold 80Plus PSU supplies ample power for the system. YOYOTECH BLACKBOX SP REVIEW:PERFORMANCE Overclocked PCs generally give very good performance for the money, and the Yoyotech BlackBox SP is no exception. You can expect to crank the quality settings right up at resolutions up to 2560x1440 without dipping below 60 fps on many titles, and similar performance can be achieved at 4K with reduced quality settings although the the highest resolutions are a little more challenging for this GTX 1070 than a stock GTX 1080, despite its overclocked performance tweaks. It’ll also breeze through VR titles, if that’s your bag. Outside of gaming, the YoyoTech BlackBox SP continues to perform well, convincingly outpacing Ryzen 7-based systems and coming in just a little behind the more expensive Core i7-7700K for most tasks. A Core i7 will pull ahead in intensively multitasking scenarios like the Cinebench R15 multiple CPU test, but this is of no real advantage to gamers who will be served very well by the BlackBox SP’s overclocked Core i5. Yoyotech BlackBox SP review: WARRANTY Even at this price, you get Yoyotech's basic 'Silver' warranty. This includes parts and labour only for the first year and requires you to ship the PC back to Yototech for repair at your expense. If there's a fault in the first month, though, Yoyotech will collect, fix and return the PC. And chances are, if it's fine after a month it will probably be fine for three years. You can upgrade to the Gold warranty for £39.99 which gives you parts cover for all three years, and upgrades the first year to collect and return shipping. For £69.99, the Platinum option is the same, but gives you collect and return shipping for the whole three years.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly. Oh Lord, I’ve just spotted that I’ve managed to misspell GeForce… :’D Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:21 emotionengine says: You might find this video (and indeed the whole channel) interesting where a guy tries to get demanding games such as DOOM running on less than impressive hardware.

His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah!

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming.

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

The four models hit a variety of price points and offer configurations aimed at the entry-level user to the up and coming gamers. We take a look at new Acer Aspire 1, 3, 5 and 7 series of laptops and their features. Aspire 1 and Aspire 3 Acer Aspire 1 On the more affordable side of the lineup is the Aspire 1, which starts at only $219. The “family-and-student focused” laptop is available in a 14-inch configuration with an Intel Celeron or Pentium processor. There is up to 64 GB of eMMC storage with 4 GB of RAM, as well as a USB 3.0, USB 2.0, Ethernet and HDMI. There’s Wi-Fi ac, 1 TB of OneDrive storage and a one-year subscription of Office 365 out of the box. Battery life is quoted at 9 hours, while the laptop weighs just 1.65 kg. Acer Aspire 3 Next up is the Aspire 3, a slightly higher-end machine with additional options that starts at $299. You get to choose between a 14-inch HD and a 15.6-inch Full HD display for the Aspire 3. The types of processors are the same as Aspire 1, though the RAM can go up to 12 GB. The storage options are likely the same, as is the Intel HD Graphics technology. A small but useful feature is Acer’s BlueLightShield, which will prevent eyes from straining under low-lighting. Aspire 5 and Aspire 7 Acer Aspire 5 The “practical and mainstream” Aspire 5 is next with a fairly sturdy package starting at $449. It will be available in 15.6″ FHD display option with an IPS panel. Under the hood, you get an Intel Kaby Lake processor of up to Core i7 variety. The Aspire 5 includes a discreet Nvidia GeForce GPU as well as up to 20 GB DDR4 2400 MHz RAM. Storage options go all the way to a 2 TB HDD or an M.2 256 GB SSD. There’s USB-C 3.1, USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports available in the Aspire 5. Furthermore, Acer guarantees a better display and audio quality for an overall impressive multimedia experience. Acer Aspire 7 The ultimate machine in the lineup is the Aspire 7,  which comes with 15 and 17-inch display options and similar processor options as the Aspire 5, but swaps the graphics module for a GTX 1060. The storage is set at a 2 TB HDD or 512 GB SSD, while the amount of RAM can be of up to 32 GB. There’s gigabit ethernet port as well as 2×2 MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi. With the similar set of ports as the Aspire 5. Aspire 7 starts at $799.

Its most important contributors are the frequency and latency of off-chip accesses and the extent to which long-latency memory accesses can be overlapped with useful computation or with each other. In this paper we present two methods to better understand application and microarchitectural interactions. An epoch profile is an intuitive way to understand the relationships between three important characteristics: theon-chip cache size, the size of the reorder window of an out-of-order processor, and the frequency of processor stalls caused by long-latency,off-chip requests (epochs). By relating these three quantities one can more easily understand an application’s memory reference behavior and thus significantly reduce the design space. While epoch profiles help to provide insight into the behavior of a single application, developing an understanding of a number of applications in the presence of area and core count constraints presents additional challenges. Epoch-based microarchitectural analysis is presented as a better way to understand the trade-offs for memory-bound applications in the presence of these physical constraints. Through epoch profiling and optimization, one can significantly reduce the multidimensional design space for hardware/software optimization through the use of high-level model-driven techniques.

Memory Encryption for General-Purpose Processors Issue No. 06 - Nov.-Dec. (2016 vol. 14) ISSN: 1540-7993 pp: 54-62 DOI Bookmark: http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MSP.2016.124 Shay Gueron , Intel Corporation and University of Haifa ABSTRACT Intel's Software Guard Extensions allows general-purpose computing platforms to run software in a trustworthy manner and securely handle encrypted data. To satisfy the technology's security goals, the external system memory must be cryptographically protected. A new hardware unit added to the processor's memory controller--the Memory Encryption Engine (MEE)--was recently developed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and freshness of this external memory traffic, against eavesdropping and tampering. The MEE is a successful feat of real-world cryptographic engineering: it's the first time such cryptographic memory protection has been added to a widely deployed general-purpose processor.

Sure, some of them are punished by overclocking or endure crowded conditions in data centers, but those machines are often cooled by custom water loops or have high-CFM fans constantly blowing fresh air through them. Sparton's Stealth-series PCs are designed to operate for long periods in extreme conditions that most computers and human beings would rather avoid entirely. The LPC-815 and LPC-835 are specced to function in ambient temperatures from -13° F (-25° C) all the way up to 158° F (70° C). They do their work without the benefit of fans or any other moving parts, as well. The LPC-815 is powered by an Intel Bay Trail Celeron J1900 quad-core SoC that runs at up to 2.42 GHz accompanied by 4 GB of non-upgradeable DDR3L memory. What the machine lacks in processing firepower it makes up somewhat in connectivity, with a pair of Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, a smattering of USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, DisplayPort and HDMI outputs, two serial ports, and four digital I/O pins for controlling things like external relays. The machine even has an onboard watchdog timer that can issue a system reset automatically should it detect a hang. The LPC-835 is a bit bigger and packs considerably more grunt in the form of a standard Intel Core i5-5350U or an optional Core i7-5650U CPU. The stock model contains 4 GB of DDR3L memory, and there's an available 8 GB option at additional cost. The machine can drive up to three monitors with its DVI-D port and DisplayPort daisy-chaining. Two Gigabit Ethernet ports come as standard equipment, and there's an option to add four more ports. Both machines come with solid state drives from 128 GB up to 1 TB. Buyers can add wireless connectivity in the form of two external-facing SIM card slots and an optional Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth card that goes into one of the machine's two mini-PCIe slots. Both machines can be powered by PSUs providing anywhere from 9V to 48V DC for enhanced compatibility with existing equipment. The unique capabilities of these PCs do not come cheap. The LPC-815 rings in at $1500 and the more capable LPC-835 starts at $2400. Sparton says both machines are compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10, as well as Ubuntu Linux.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:37 ColonelFlanders says: I know, and to be honest it’s outrageous that they don’t take the time to develop their game three times so that people from the past can have a go as well.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 23:06 Panther_Modern says: The game is terribly optimized, it isn’t a question of handling a weird use case that no one cares about. For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.) Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post. So, Hi! :D (And sorry if my english is shoddy here and there – not my native language. :)) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:26 Hydrogene says: Great post! I always have a great satisfaction at running a game below spec on an old laptop so I know exactly how you feel. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:36 Mister eX says: Thanks! Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly.

His channel is aptly called “Low Spec Gamer” and with some choice console commands he squeezes the last drops of performance out of DOOM running on a Celeron and Intel HD Graphics: link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:49 Mister eX says: Yeah, I know him! His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah!

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 22:11 haldolium says: Do you use streaming? My laptop had the same issues, clocking down and getting too hot and also way too loud, so I tried streaming instead. With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 09:06 Kasjer says: Well, streaming is not a viable option while traveling. Maybe in hotel, but not during long train ride or flight. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..!

There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters – they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it. Megan Squire, Professor of Computing Sciences, Elon University This article was originally published on The Conversation.

What do Microsoft's Windows S and Surface Laptop mean for Apple in the education market? Microsoft is holding an education event today, complete with a new version of Windows and a new Surface. Windows S is a simpler, more secure version aimed at students, while Surface Laptop is Microsoft's ultrabook for education. Windows 10 S is Microsoft's newest edition of Windows 10, with one specific change over previous, "normal" editions of Windows 10. This new edition of Windows 10 is locked to the Windows Store for all your apps and games, meaning if you want to install apps on Windows 10 S, you can only do so if said apps are available in the Store to begin with. Makes it sound almost like iOS, where you lose online sources for apps but gain the trust that comes from a single on-device storefront. Interestingly, if Windows S ever becomes a constraint, you'll be able to upgrade it to Windows Pro. On Mac, you can get similar functionality by turning Gatekeeper all the way up, the adjusting it back down if/when needed. The Surface Laptop appears to be built for higher-education students and professionals who don't need the form factor of a Surface Pro or Surface Book. Sporting a more typical laptop clamshell design, with multiple color options including Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue and Graphite Gold. It's a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, meaning this screen will look crisp and clear much like on any other Surface product. The colors are fun, much like gold and rose gold on MacBook. The processors are Intel's Kaby Lake, which is more recent than Apple's last Skylake update, and core i5 rather than the more anemic coreM. (Which cry every time they see the Apple A9 in iPad Pro.) The lowest end model starts at $999, which is 11-inch MacBook Air territory, though it sports a Retina-style display, which the Air does not. Last time, we saw Microsoft take aim at Apple's traditional pro market with Windows Creative and the Surface Studio. Now Microsoft is taking aim not just at Apple in education, but Google and no-cost ChromeOS and low-cost Chrome Books as well. As Apple has driven increasingly mainstream with iOS and the Mac, both pro and education have been stretched thinner and left to languish longer. Apple has already announced a new Mac Pro will be coming, but not this year. It remains to be seen when Kabylake updates for iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook — and anything for Mac mini — come our way. It'll take more than just new chipsets to really recapture the hearts and minds, and budgets, of Apple's traditional niche markets, though. It'll take Apple figuring out a way to scale so it can meet the needs of its new mainstream market without leaving pros and education, among others, behind. It's slightly more complicated for Apple, though. Unlike Microsoft, Apple has a flourishing mobile operating system, as well, in iOS. Plus, iPad did just get updated to a new, more-affordable-than-ever model and a partnership with Logitech to provide discount keyboards at volume for schools. If handled wrong, that story becomes confusing. If handled right, though, iPad and Mac liberate each other to excel at opposite ends of the spectrum, and with some overlap in between. If iOS 11 brings iPad forward the same way iOS 9 did, we might have part of our answer. WWDC 2017 in June, which is often but not always a software-only affair, seems like the next opening for iOS and macOS devices both. What will Apple do with it? And what would you want to see them do? Reader comments Last time, Microsoft targeted Apple's creatives. Now, education. 26 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Emeroid I’ll take the Windows offering pls. iOS is too restrictive. 0 15 hours ago Reply mvpilot172 Windows 10S sounds pretty restricted, like trying to be a chromeOS competitor. Might be an ok OS if their store is robust enough. Most consumer don't need "open" OS's and usually get themselves infected by some malware/virus in trying to circumvent built in protections to get stolen software/music/movies/etc for free. 0 14 hours ago Reply Emeroid Yes, but you have the choice to upgrade. The choice. 0 1 min ago Reply Benyamin Adriyan Just to remember last time I used Windows Laptop & started thinking "For how long I keep worry about virus while doing my work?" That's my momentum to start using OSX at that time (macOS now). 0 5 hours ago Reply Emeroid I use Windows everyday and never think that, (Win 10 is a completely different prospect from Windows of old), furthermore if your attitude is that OSX is invulnerable you are exactly the kind of person that malware writers will be targeting. 0 3 min ago Reply Mike Majeski I think they need to get the 12" Macbook down to the $999 price point - $1300 is simply too expensive for what you get and you might as well go for the Pro. Only "affordable" option right now is the Macbook Air ($999, but usually can be found between $799-849) but that is starting to REALLY show its age and the screen is embarrassing at this point. You might still be able to sell K-12 schools on iPads, but I don't think there are any college students going off to school with only an iPad Pro. And for many of those students, $999 is the perfect price point for a high-quality PC that will last all 4 years. 0 13 hours ago Reply DannyJJK Depends what those college students are studying, something like linguistics could be done fine on an iPad 0 10 hours ago Reply aBadInfuence I'm a college student exclusively using my iPad Pro. My roommate has a trash can Mac Pro so if I absolutely need a PC I jump on his, but it's pretty rare. Most of the time my iPad does every thing I need it to. 0 10 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi So basically the best thing to do is to buy an ipad and acquire a roommate with a proper computer? Swell! 0 1 hour ago Reply cmdacos Many students are just Facebook Pros and Snapchat Pros so iPad Pro will be just fine for them. Otherwise get a laptop/MacBook if you want to do anything serious. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 7 hours ago Reply quakerotis All this hype and this is all they delivered? Microsoft is clueless.

Please explain. 0 13 hours ago Reply jkeitz Its hard to imagine this will lure anyone away from iPad or Macbook. Maybe if they were sub $400 they would do well against the Chromebook market, but at $1000? 0 13 hours ago Reply Lych From a MacBook? Probably not if they already have one. Otherwise if you're looking at specs, this one seems better. As for the iPad, realistically that's not really an alternative. I would pick any laptop with a decent resolution and decent spec-sheet over an iPad for school work any day. The iPad lacks a keyboard and their storage options are lacking as well. As capable a device the iPad is, the college daily driver is just not a viable use-case without workarounds and additional investments with it. Your mileage may vary, but I have never seen anyone use an iPad in education as their only device. 0 13 hours ago Reply DannyJJK The iPad could easily be used as the only-device in education, although it depends what you're studying. Documents/general work will easily fit on 32GB, plus many people use cloud services to keep their work backed up too. You can easily get a cheap keyboard for the iPad 0 10 hours ago Reply infinihertz Microsoft's partners like Acer just announced, concurrent with this morning's event, $300 laptops with Windows 10 S. Microsoft is deliberately keeping Surface as a higher-priced, lower-volume brand to keep their OEM partners happy but still prod them in the right direction. If they launched at < $400 I'm not sure they'd have a bunch of partners. Now they can sell some of these laptops, and try to fight ChromeOS, iOS and macOS in education with cheap(er) partner devices. I think that was probably the right strategy. 0 12 hours ago Reply centosguy You might wish to tell the full history. Yes, Apple dominated the education market in the 80s and early 90s. The Apple II also dominated computer video gaming in that same era. The reason for this was because at the time, the "personal computing" scene was IBM and Apple. IBM - being International BUSINESS Machines - regarded computing to be the province of enterprises, research and on-the-go elite professionals and felt that everything else was an unsustainable fad. That left Apple to focus on "everything else." Then Microsoft and the clone hardware makers, they began to focus on "everything else" too .... Microsoft to increase market share and the clone makers because at the time they could not compete directly with IBM. When that happened, Wintel surpassed Apple in education, video games and even - in terms of raw numbers if not reputation - among creatives. So it is not Microsoft "going after" anything. It is their coming out with new products in a realm where - while Apple may enjoy the reputation (though mostly among Apple fans) - they have had the vast majority of the market share and profits for a quarter of a century. The vast majority of schools buy Windows laptops - or did until the Chromebook - and it is what the vast amount of students own too. For goodness sakes <b>Mac has 10% market share!</b> So the idea that it was the platform of choice for most schools and students - or even most creatives when we are talking about raw numbers here - was self deception. 0 13 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi I'm puzzled as to why Rene has neglected to mention the utter car crash that was the eMac. This abomination was the one of the primary reasons why the secondary school and technical college near me abandoned Apple for Windows and Chromebooks. 0 11 hours ago Reply Anthony Hernandez7 I think that as of right now Microsoft is beating Apple in computing. If windows can only find out how to make the OS important on phones. It could destroy apple and android. 0 11 hours ago Reply DannyJJK The only reason Windows is "important" on desktops is because they got in there early and the only competition they had at the time was the Mac. macOS and Linux are far better OS's than Windows at their core, much more stable, secure and optimized. I got a small netbook for free, that came with Windows 7. The poor thing could barely run Windows, I went and put Linux on it and the thing ran like a dream. I doubt Windows will ever be important on phones, that will always belong to iOS and Android from now on 0 10 hours ago Reply cmdacos Microsoft is killing Apple right now on delivering to a target market whether it be Pros/Creatives or in education. Like the new focus from MS to be more aggressive. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 7 hours ago Reply Anthony Hernandez7 Plus these laptops are more powerful that the MacBook 0 11 hours ago Reply Nocticis You have to levels of education sectors, Elementary and secondary. With elementary it's about affordablity and durability. Chromebooks has this sector and there is any competition. Apples $300 iPad is still to pricy and add on a keyboard that can be lost when detached is a no go. Same with Microsoft, they don't offer anything that can handle 1st graders Tiny destructive hands at a price point of $150 like chromebooks do. They're not built to be pretty or anything just built to connect to internet and don't care if they feel cheap or plastic. The secondary level of education is really up to the student and their workload. Honestly windows Or macOS will and really comes down to preference and price, where $1000 seems to be the sweet spot. Apple has the "brand" advantage over windows. But by no means can an iPad Pro replace and laptop as of right not. Microsoft could be on to something with the surfaces, but the branding and marketing can't really crack it. Apple is relying on it brand name more than ever and really needs to deliver something to back it up soon. I'm a student and the iPad can't do what I need. A lot of my online classes tell me I cant use my iPad because of lack of flash support or I still need a USB port for transferring information and need to remember to carry adapters. No mouse support. I know about the touch generation and I am one but the education sector is still behind on technology and I need things like a mouse and USB, things that are standard on my Mac. I laugh at the iPad Pro commercials about being a laptop replacement with the added bonus of having cellular. Look. Maybe typing up an paper or reading email could be done on an iPad with ease and could be more suited for a "computer" for a soccer mom, but at school the iPad just doesn't work for me. It's not just the hardware but also the software. iOS can't hack it at some things and that's why the MacBook or even the MacBook Air would be more valuable to a student over a decked out iPad Pro. As of now the iPad is just a toy. That I watch Netflix on after class in bed and don't want a Mac sitting on top of me but don't want to squint my eyes at my iPhone. I'd love to see some sort of hybrid between my MacBook and iPad though like the surface and think Apple is working their way there, but just milking it right now until they figure out the perfect hardware and software for said device. If I was asked on my opinion on what to buy, I'd ask them about what they do. If you're a student or have a job where you need to work from a "computer" I'd say spend the $1000 on a MacBook/iMac depending on further questions into the nature of said schooling and or work. If you're not in school and don't really do a lot of your daily work from a "computer" I'd suggest an iPad, in which I'd then ask questions on what you want/need. Smart connector is nice, but Bluetooth keyboards get the job done. Pencil is neich. However best bang for the buck to me is the 9.7 pro. More so because of the speakers than anything else and if you do ever need/want the pencil it's compatible. 0 11 hours ago Reply sdreamer Remember they went after creatives, and just delivered the Studio. what happened with that? Nothing really. The Creators update was more of a SP1 type of update that just had fixes, and ooooh 3D paint. Nothing else that leverages creators or professionals. In the the end, I hate to say it as I love the Surface Studio, but the Surface Studio is just kinda gimmicky and restricted. Inspirational yes, but usable? Not really. Needs better horse power to drive pro apps at that resolution, and it needs pro apps in its store. 0 11 hours ago Reply Richard Schembri Sounds like Windows RT all over again. Who's going to pay $999 for a Chromebook competitor, not many people. Give me an iPad and a MacBook anytime!! 0 10 hours ago Reply cmdacos Really $3000 in product is better than a $1000 product?

Most Popular By Eric Limer May 2, 2017 Today at an event in New York, Microsoft announced the newest product in its Surface line. It's not a crazy transforming laptop, or a giant high-end touchscreen desktop. The new Surface Laptop is something a little simpler. It's just a laptop. Under three pounds with a 13.5-inch, 3:2 display, the Surface Laptop is ostensibly a laptop for students, but with far more fit and finish than a typical Chromebook. Available in four different colors, the Surface Laptop has a soft, felt lining around its keyboard and a nice metallic body that feels sturdy without being heavy. Unlike its transforming brethren, there's nothing particularly crazy about its design. In fact, it's feels and looks an awful lot like a Macbook Air or the new Macbook Pro (the one without the Touchbar) but in Microsoft's signature Surface style: angular and slick. The Surface Laptop starts at $1,000, with that cheapest version sporting Intel's Core i5 processor. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Instead of full Windows 10, the Surface Laptop comes with a free copy of the new Windows 10 S, a barebones version of Windows designed for use in an education setting. Windows 10 S only runs applications from the Windows store, giving it a closed ecosystem that makes it almost more like an iPad. Or, like the Surface RT, Microsoft's failed attempt to make this same sort of gadget a few years ago. Ostensibly, this keeps you safe because any app that's available through the Microsoft store has been vetted for security, but it eliminates thousands of programs that are perfectly safe but not in the app store for other reasons. This move does have actual security advantages, but the much bigger advantage is for Microsoft, not the users—this gives software makers an incentive to make their programs available in the Microsoft Store, where Microsoft will get a cut of sales. For the average user, any benefit in security is bound to be outweighed by the hassle of not being able to use all programs out of the box. Google Chrome, for instance, is currently missing from the Microsoft Store. Fortunately, Windows 10 S also includes the option to be switched over to Windows 10 Pro by an administrator in a classroom setting, or by its owner in the case of a Surface Laptop owner. So there's a full, unfettered version of Windows hiding behind the scenes. For schools, this flip will be free, but for normal students or anyone else who's picked up the Surface Laptop, that upgrade will cost you. At this point, there are enough apps available in the Microsoft Store that using Windows 10 S exclusively might be feasible, but it's certainly not ideal. Thousands of programs—specifically smaller indie applications and many, many video games—are not available in the store. Without an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, the Surface Laptop will, in essence, have one hand behind its back. If you're considering picking one up, it might be wise to just add the cost to untie it to the upfront price, chances are you'll want to.

NuTonomy's software, sensors and computing platforms will be installed in Peugeot 3008 models as part of plans to develop the technology needed for large fleets of autonomous cars, PSA and nuTonomy said in a statement on Wednesday. The latest PSA Group project seeks to work on "level 5" autonomous capable vehicles, which require no driver input, and will allow both companies to study how an "on-demand autonomous vehicle mobility service" performs, they said. The combination is the latest between technology and automotive companies after Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, last month unveiled an autonomous cars development partnership with supplier Robert Bosch, while BMW has announced an alliance with chip maker Intel and Israel's Mobileye . Autonomous driving in urban areas requires a more radical approach to vehicle design, particularly for software and sensors, to help a car navigate inner city obstacles, said Anne Laliron, Head of the Business Lab at PSA Group. "That is the reason we jump on the opportunity to work with nuTonomy," Laliron told Reuters. PSA Group will use the project to learn about what components make sense, and which suppliers are available, Laliron said. Following the initial phase of this partnership, the companies will consider expanding their on-road AV testing initiative to other major cities. nuTonomy, a software company founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) academics and McKinsey management consultants was the first to begin on the road testing of driverless taxi services in Singapore last year. It raised $16 million last May in a funding round led by Highland Capital Partners and has backing from Singapore government authorities and Samsung Ventures, among others.

Is Windows 10 S A Re-Do Of The Windows RT Cock-Up? Anthony Caruana May 3, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories microsoft windows 10 windows 10 s Share Source: Microsoft Earlier today, Microsoft announced a new Windows PC. Unlike the previous members of the Surface family, the Surface Laptop doesn’t have a detachable keyboard. And it also lacks Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro. Instead, it ships with a cutback version of Windows dubbed Windows 10 S. That means a Surface laptop will be limited to only running apps available through the Windows Store and not desktop apps. What makes this confusing is that an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro is free - for a limited time at least. When the original Surface was released, users had the choice of a heavier, more powerful and more expensive Surface device or the Surface RT, which ran a limited version of Windows 8. Where it differs from Windows 10 S is that Windows RT was made to run on 32-Bit ARM processors whereas Windows 10 S plays nice on the Intel CPUs that power the vast majority of the computers businesses use. It’s clear Microsoft is undergoing a transformation. Slowly but surely, they are moving away from a software company that dabbled in hardware into a more vertically integrated business that delivers the whole widget. In a sense, they are a little like Apple except that they license their operating system software. The Surface Laptop seems to be aimed directly at potential Chromebook and entry-level MacBook Air and MacBook Pro markets. That’s a sweet spot for education users. I can see this as being the kind of device my kids would use for high school and university. It’s inexpensive at US$999, offers decent specs with a Core i5 processor, 4GB of memory and 128GB SSD, and comes in a different colours. It supports the Surface Pen on the 13.5” PixelSense display running at 2256 x 1504. For Australian buyers, there’s no word yet on offical price and availability - just a bunch of “Coming Soon” tags on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/surface/devices/surface-laptop/tech-specs"Surface Laptop website. And The Verge reports that other OEMs have already announced their own Windows 10 S systems. But here’s the thing. That target audience will, almost certainly, want to run desktop apps. I’m hard pressed to think of a scenario where someone buying a $1000 laptop won’t want to run Microsoft office or something similar. Sure - you can run those through a web browser if you’re a Office 365 subscriber but until you upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro you’re shut out for the apps most people rely on to do their jobs - whether they are students or employees. The good news is that, unlike the dead-end road of Windows RT, there’s an upgrade path from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro. For US$49, you can upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro (but not Home). And that upgrade is free for the first few weeks of the US release. The good news is Windows 10 S is not a dead-end. The biggest issue with Windows RT devices was that once Microsoft decided to abandon the platform, there were lots of machines left without an upgrade path. As the Surface Laptop runs commodity hardware, I assume it will remain a supported platform for some time. So, the good news is Windows 10 S is not a cock-up. But, the splitting of Windows 10 into a third major fork is a sign that the company is still locked, to some degree, in their old school thinking. When Windows 7 was released, there were six different editions: Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate. By the time we got to Widows 8, that narrowed to four: Windows 8, Pro, Enterprise and the ill-fated RT. And while there are, officially, eight editions of Windows 10, only two are widely available: Home and Pro. Now, with the addition of Windows 10 S, Microsoft is adding complexity that will, most likely, only confuse consumers. There’s a lot to be said for Apple’s approach - one operating system per platform. When you buy a Mac, you get macOS. There is only one version and it doesn’t add or remove features to create artificial product differentiation. For example, BitLocker, Microsoft’s drive encryption tech, is part of Windows 10 Pro but not the Home edition. That makes no sense to me. The error Microsoft is making is one of creating frustration for users. I’ve spent enough time at large retailers asking questions of sales associates who don’t know or understand the difference between the two editions of Windows 10. I can see customers walking into a store, buying a Surface Laptop and Microsoft Office only to discover that running office will require a further $50 or more in order to upgrade the operating system on their $1000 laptop so they can type a document or create a spreadsheet. I’m currently testing a Surface Pro 4 as part of my search for a perfect computer for when I travel. It’s a fine piece of hardware and shows Microsoft can design and build great hardware. But it’s time for them to make life easier and simply release one edition of Windows. Windows 10 S might not be an error of Windows RT proportions but there’s seems little point to artificially differentiating a product and creating confusion for users.

This is the direction we’re headed, according to Larry Smarr, founding director of the California Institute of Telecommunications & Information Technology at UC San Diego. While his expertise lies in computer networks and infrastructure, Smarr has emerged as a de facto leader in quantified health—largely due to his relentless curiosity about his own health. In 2011, Smarr diagnosed his own Crohn’s disease long before he showed any symptoms. Smarr laid out his vision for a looming transformation in healthcare at the recent Xconomy San Diego Forum on the Human Impact of Innovation. The advances making this transformation possible include next-generation genome sequencing (where the cost of sequencing has been dramatically plunging), combined with new biomedical data from a host of sensors and blood tests. Smarr’s work has contributed to a growing realization that the trillions of microbes in the human gut play a crucial role in maintaining human health. In his talk, Smarr dryly noted that the density of information in a fecal sample works out to roughly 1 billion microbes per gram of stool, encompassing a treasure trove of data that can be collected non-invasively every day. (The microbiome collectively contains 3.3 million genes—roughly 100 times more than the 23,000 genes of the human genome.) This massive river of data would overwhelm conventional computing technology, but Smarr said a revolution in machine learning—based on a radically new (non-von Neumann) chip design—is now making it possible to analyze big data streams and monitor human health in unprecedented ways. Google’s first machine-learning chip is 30 times faster than conventional computer processors and graphics processors, Smarr said. As a result, Google and companies like San Diego-based KnuEdge, which is poised to roll out its neural-based AI technology sometime this year, and Intel’s San Diego-based Artificial Intelligence Products Group (headed by former Nervana Systems CEO Naveen Rao) are moving toward the development of what he called “planetary” computers with Web-based AI capabilities. Smarr said the promise of microbiome data as a way to predict chronic disease was demonstrated late last year by scientists at UC San Diego. Using machine learning technology, the team said, they had successfully trained a computer system to tell the difference between a person with a “healthy” intestine from someone with inflammatory bowel disease by analyzing the genetic makeup of the microbes in their gut. Machine learning techniques also are being applied to X-rays and other medical imaging used in medical diagnostics. With such technology, Smarr said, “the worst radiologist with this kind of machine support would be better than the best radiologist without this support.” Following Smarr’s presentation, other luminaries discussed their progress in healthtech: —Jeff Hawkins, vice president for reproductive and genetic health at San Diego-based Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN), discussed how genome sequencing is being used to analyze fetal DNA in maternal blood samples—providing a more accurate and less-risky replacement for amniocentesis. —Steven Steinhubl, a cardiologist and director of digital medicine at the Scripps Translational Science Institute, gave an overview of a 40-year effort to gather medical and genomic data on 1 million Americans “to better understand what makes each of us unique.” —Clayton Lewis, the co-founder and CEO of Seattle-based Arivale, described how Arivale combines personal genomic and biomedical data with health, nutrition, and fitness “coaching” to help individuals avoid chronic diseases like diabetes. At some point in the future, Lewis said, Arivale will scan individuals for 60 diseases, assess how close they are to the tipping point for each disease, and prepare a plan for treating or reversing disease in a meaningful way. Machine learning was a recurring theme throughout the forum, with Intel’s Urs Köster predicting that AI technology already is transforming healthcare, finance, retailing, transportation, energy, government, and other industries. AI technology also has enabled the robotics technologies behind self-driving vehicles to advance more rapidly than expected, according to Henrik Christensen, director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics at UC San Diego. In a presentation on the roadmap for self-driving cars, Christensen predicted that autonomous, self-driving cars would be driving on U.S. roads by 2025. But significant technology hurdles must still be overcome, including the ability of machine vision systems to “see” through snowstorms and other tough weather conditions. “People are being way too optimistic about self-driving technology, and how quickly it’s going to be in place,” Christensen said. KnuEdge founder and CEO Dan Goldin said he realized a critical need for a new type of machine intelligence while considering a manned mission to Mars during the nine years he led NASA (from 1992 to 2001). The 40-minute lag in communications between the Earth and Mars-bound spacecraft meant “you have no mission control,” Goldin said. After retiring from NASA, Goldin set out to create low-power processing technology that was modeled on the highly efficient neural processes of the human brain. The first KnuEdge chip, built with an older manufacturing technology, features 256 cores—inspired by neuron-like cells—on a single chip. The company, stealthy for more than a decade, said last year it also had developed “LambdaFabric” technology that is ideally suited for massively parallel processing applications. KnuEdge says its fabric, based on neurobiological principles, enables its multicore Hermosa processor to connect to as many as 512,000 other Hermosa processors with a latency (interaction lag) of just 400 nanoseconds. KnuEdge is now preparing to provide cloud-based machine intelligence as a service. As Goldin put it, “We want to enable anyone to provide an AI experience to anyone, anywhere,” and he predicted that San Diego will be at the center of “real machine intelligence” within five years. Asked in an e-mail afterward for an explanation of what he meant by “real machine intelligence,” Goldin declined to elaborate. (Special thanks to Joyce Thorne for providing her notes from the forum.)

The report from the office of National Intelligence Director Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people who U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism. It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful who were identified in 2015. Dan Coats at the U.S. Capitol in February 2015. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images The NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone "metadata," records of callers' and recipients' phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls — but not their content — since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The report came as Congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information on non-U.S. persons outside the United States and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Privacy advocates have argued that Section 702 permits the NSA to spy on internet and telephone communications of Americans without warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements. Related: Ex-NSA Chief Hayden: Agency Loses Intel but Gains Politically With Collection Change The report said that on one occasion in 2016, the FBI obtained information about an American in response to a search of Section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence. The report did not address how frequently the FBI obtained information about Americans while investigating foreign intelligence matters, however. The NSA said Friday that it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant. The new report also came amid allegations, recently repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser Susan Rice asked the NSA to unmask the names of U.S. persons caught in the surveillance. Both Republican and Democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation. Officials argued Tuesday that the 151 million records collected last year were relatively few compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013. Related: Top Officials Want to Split Cyber Command From NSA Because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers, the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller, the officials said. They said they had no breakdown of how many individuals' phone records were among those collected. In all, according to the report, U.S. officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, Coats' office reported on Tuesday. The report said the names of 1,934 "U.S. persons" were "unmasked" last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or why. Officials said in the report that U.S. intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make more information public about U.S. electronic eavesdropping. "This year's report continues our trajectory towards greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law," said Timothy Barrett, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Mr. Beachler is a Silicon Valley veteran with over 30 years of success in developing and marketing cutting-edge technologies. His background includes more than 16 years of experience in a variety of engineering and marketing roles at Altera Corporation, a leading provider of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) products, which was acquired by Intel Corporation in 2015 for over $16 billion. He has also served as Vice-President of Marketing, Operations, and Systems Design at Stretch Inc., a provider of embedded video processing solutions up until its acquisition by Exar Corporation in 2014. While at Exar, Mr. Beachler was appointed Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Business Development. Most recently, he served at Xilinx Corporation, the leading worldwide independent provider of FPGA products, and led the marketing of imaging, video and machine learning solutions for Xilinx's industrial, scientific, and medical markets. Business Development The appointment of Robert Beachler positions the Company to capitalize on targeted large addressable markets in artificial intelligence. Mr. Beachler has a proven track record of success in bringing products to market and driving growth. He will build a marketing and business development team in Europe and the United States this year, followed by Asia and Australia in 2018. Mr. Beachler's initial efforts will be to drive revenue growth in markets where the Company has demonstrated success, expand the number of customers in these markets, and introduce the Company's hardware accelerated products to further enhance its position in large-scale deployments. Commercial Surveillance: This market is highlighted by engagements in the gaming industry. The worldwide gaming industry includes approximately 2,600 casinos and over 50,000 gaming tables. In addition to existing deployments, the Company is currently in discussions or trials with 17 casinos including the MGM Group in the United States, the Crown Casino Group in Australia, a Sands China operated casino in Macau and a number of independently operated Native American Tribal casinos including Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Pechanga in California and Pocono Downs in Pennsylvania. The Company's business model in the gaming industry is based on a fee paid for each active table on a daily basis, thereby creating an ongoing revenue stream from a potentially large and diverse customer base. The Company is in the process of signing another evaluation protocol with the CISCO Innovation Centre of Perth. The CIIC will perform the evaluation of BrainChip's advanced video analytic technologies, aiming at boosting the reliability of access authorization around sensitive areas. This is in addition to the ongoing trials by the CIIC of advanced video analytics for transport safety, which are currently expanding to a national level. Civil Surveillance: The growing threat of terrorism and violent crime is driving demand for real-time video analytics. This is a large and growing market, which includes Homeland Security, Metropolitan Law Enforcement, Airports and Mass Transit.  The market for Civil Surveillance is large, well funded and geographically diverse. The Company serves the challenging requirements for video analytics, including facial and pattern recognition. The Company continues to work closely with the French Department of Homeland Security and Paris municipal law enforcement. Drawing on the success of these relationships, a new trial is set to begin in June with the law enforcement agency in Toulouse, France, which will further inform the Paris municipal law enforcement agency regarding the compelling benefits of the BrainChip video analytic solutions. Additionally, there is another new trial planned in the third quarter of 2017 with the Toulouse passenger rail authority. The Company has opportunities with multiple schools in the United States and is currently in discussions with a school district in the state of New York for a deployment that represents potential revenue of $600,000. The Company has already been selected as their vendor for video analytics and the school district is in a funding process that will enable them to begin deployment. Machine Vision: The desire for highly accurate visual inspection methods is driving demand for artificial intelligence. The Company has partnered with companies such as SAFRAN in Paris, France, which is developing an innovative inspection system for a mission critical manufacturing application. As well, at Airbus in Toulouse, France, the Company has collaborated on a variety of video analytic projects. Other applications include vehicle identification and infrastructure inspection. The Machine Vision market is most notably represented by the automotive industry. As Autonomous Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) and fully autonomous vehicles become more prevalent the requirements for real-time video analytics become more critical. BrainChip's Spiking Neural Network represents a best-in-class solution for this demanding application. The Company is currently engaged with IniLabs in Switzerland, a developer of DVS cameras that are applicable in autonomous vehicle applications. The Company is also engaged in discussions with Volkswagen. JAST Technology License In March of 2017 the Company acquired an exclusive license to a next-generation neural networking technology developed by CERCO (Brain and Cognition Research Center) in Toulouse, France. The technology has been developed specifically for use with spiking inputs. The advanced Spiking Neural Network and learning rules maximize processing speed while minimizing power consumption. The JAST technology will be implemented on the Company's proprietary SNAP core. This solution will provide compelling advantages in systems where autonomous real-time learning is critical, including but not limited to autonomous vehicles and drones, ADAS and financial technology aimed at improving the speed of trading algorithms. Integration of Spikenet Technologies in an FPGA Platform In March of 2017 The Company made a major achievement by integrating the field proven Spikenet algorithms and software with a hardware core developed specifically for visual applications. The FPGA hardware solution will provide a fast, low-power solution that can run a large number of video streams simultaneously for video analytics including facial and pattern recognition. A multi-core FPGA hardware solution is expected during the second quarter and the Company plans to engage early adopter customers in the third quarter of 2017. The hardware solution will reduce the total cost of ownership in large deployments of surveillance systems and is expected to drive significant revenue growth for the Company. CORPORATE Option and Performance Rights Issue The Company issued 27,100,000 unlisted options during the quarter to newly appointed staff as a part of its incentive program and in order to appropriately align the interests of staff and shareholders. The Company issued 1,500,000 performance rights to Robert Beachler as part of his appointment, which vest subject to various time and performance based hurdles. 1,000,000 unlisted options lapsed in accordance with their terms during the quarter. Quarterly Expenditure Expenditures in the quarter were materially higher than in the previous quarter primarily due to staffing in marketing and engineering, and legal and financial expenses associated with the Company's evaluation of domicile and exchange listing. The Company has made no decision as yet on re-domiciling the Company. The Company had approximately $1.9 million in cash at the end of the quarter. The Board is closely monitoring the Company's funding needs and expects to initiate a capital raise to support future cash requirements including continued engineering on the SNAP technology, and staffing in engineering, sales and marketing to further the Company's engagement with customers and support revenue growth.

The device, aptly named Surface Laptop, is indeed not a hybrid like the Surface Book, and is more reasonably priced. According to Microsoft, the 13.5 inch 3:2 display on Surface Laptop is the ever thinnest in a laptop. This and the fact that everything inside the device has been packed super tight means that at .57" and 2.76 lbs it is both thinner and lighter than even the MacBook Air. The display is said to produce 3.4 million pixels so its resolution (2256 x 1504) is around the traditional QHD but with 3:2 aspect ratio differentiates itself from both the widescreen 16:9 or 16:9 (MacBook Air) laptops as well as the old school 4:3 displays. According to Microsoft's own Panos Panay the Surface Laptop is also more powerful than the competition. With Intel's Core i5 and i7 processors Panay claims it is up to 50 percent faster than MacBook Air. With all that power the promised 14.5 hour battery life (with video playback) seems like a good deal, especially considering the weight. The keyboard is surrounded by alcantara fabric that we first saw on Surface Pro 4 keyboard, and Microsoft has managed to retain a respectable 1.5 mm press depth. The computer comes equipped with Windows 10 S, which is Microsoft's new operating system, essentially a lite version, that allows app installs only from the Windows Store. If you want to install programs outside the app store, you need to invest in an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. The laptop has one USB 3.0 port, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, mini DisplayPort connection as well as SurfaceConnection for further connectivity. Microsoft also unveiled the new Surface Arc Mouse which is a new version of the Microsoft Arc Touch mouse from a few years back. Surface Laptop will come in four colors (platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold) next month. The shipments will begin on June 15th and the prices start at $999 for the Core i5/4GB/128GB version.

The Surface laptop comes in four colors - gold, platinum, blue and burgundy - and ditches a metal area around the keyboard for a softer microfibre lining. It has a 13.5-inch (34.3 centimetre) touch screen, runs the latest Intel processors and gets 14.5 hours of battery life, according to Microsoft. It also will run the new Windows 10S operating system, software the company presented on Tuesday (May 2) that will be faster and offer better security than previous versions. Microsoft is targeting the new operating system and laptop at the education market, where the total value of personal computing device shipments - including desktops, notebooks and tablets - has reached US$15.6 billion, according to research firm IDC. Microsoft and Apple had long dominated the school computing market, but Alphabet Inc's Google has made inroads recently with its low-priced and simple Chromebooks. Windows 10S will be available on cheaper computers targeted at elementary schools where teachers want predictable, easy to maintain and quick-booting machines. Dell, Samsung Electronics and Toshiba, among others, will offer new PCs running Windows 10S from US$229 starting this summer. With the new Surface laptop, Microsoft is hoping to attract college-age buyers who want both a reliable machine and premium design and materials. "We know a lot of students use MacBook Airs and MacBook pros and those are awesome," Panos Panay, vice president for Surface Computing, said at the event. But he said the Surface laptop is lighter and thinner with a longer battery life than any MacBook Air or MacBook Pro on the market today. The new device represents Microsoft's first classic clamshell computer - previous versions were either a tablet or a hybrid tablet/notebook. The base model includes 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM and runs on an Intel Core i5 processor. More expensive configurations are also available with a faster Intel Core i7 chip, storage capacities up to a terabyte and as much as 16GB of RAM. Core to the new laptop is Windows 10S, which looks and feels like the current operating system but limits the apps users can download to those available only from Microsoft. The company says that extends battery life and makes the laptop faster and more secure.

This allows attackers "to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products," which "means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware – right under the nose of the operating system – and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on." AMT has direct access to the networking features of your computer, allowing this to be exploited remotely. It is believed that business and server systems will feel the most pain from this as these systems commonly have the impacted features enabled. Intel has published instructions on how to determine if you system has the features enabled, and you should be sure to check your system.

Fortunately, OEM answers are now coming from HP and Acer, taking earlier education-oriented Windows 10 releases and simply replacing the software with Windows 10 S. The HP ProBook x360 Education Edition usually comes with Windows 10 Pro at $329, but is currently on sale at $299.99. The tough-duty laptop comes with an Intel Celeron CPU and 4GB of RAM to power an 11.6-inch display at 768p. There’s only 64GB of storage. Meanwhile, Acer is converting its TravelMate Spin B1 Convertible for Windows 10 S as well. It, too, has just as much memory, just as Intel a processor and just as big of a screen, though it’s now in full HD and has touch capacity. That one currently sells for $399.99. We don’t have details on specific changes just yet, including pricing. We’re also wondering about the price to upgrade to regular Windows 10 — that is, if the Windows 10 S laptop with the upgrade license will cost more than what the regular version of the device would cost.

Peter Bright - May 2, 2017 10:59 pm UTC reader comments 180 Share this story Hands on with the Surface Laptop. Video shot and edited by Jennifer Hahn. NEW YORK CITY—The Surface Laptop has no gimmicks or novelties. It's a Microsoft PC with Surface branding. But unlike the predecessor systems—the Surface RT and Surface Pro with their convertible tablet and kickstand design, the Surface Book with its hybrid concept and detachable GPU, the Surface Studio with its hinged folding screen, even the Surface Hub with its multiuser touch and integrated video conferencing—the Surface Laptop has no twist, no unique spin that sets it apart from its competition. It's just a laptop. At least the Surface Laptop is a good-looking laptop. Downright stylish, in fact. The 13.5-inch screen (with a peculiar 2256×1504 resolution, retaining the 3:2 aspect ratio used on other Surface systems) is bright and crisp. Bezels are inoffensive. The system is very slim, at 14.5mm thick, with a slight taper. The lines are clean. The weight is respectable, for the screen size, at 2.76lb (1.25kg). The standard platinum grey looks good, if conventional; the burgundy, "cobalt blue," and "graphite gold" look better still. The design is thoughtful, too, with the hinge appearing "invisible" when the system is opened. Opening feels effortless, too, with just the right amount of hinge stiffness. The Surface Laptop. Microsoft As captioned by Microsoft: "Fashionable man holding the Cobalt Blue Surface Laptop in his hands." Microsoft As captioned by Microsoft: "Fashionable woman holding the Burgundy Surface Laptop close to her chest." Microsoft As captioned by Microsoft: "Fashionable woman placing the Platinum Surface Laptop in her bag." Microsoft As captioned by Microsoft: "Fashionable woman leaning over a table typing on the Graphite Gold Surface Laptop." Microsoft Clockwise, from top left: Cobalt Blue, Graphite Gold, Burgundy, Platinum Microsoft The device will be available in a variety of colors. Microsoft Microsoft has gone with USB-A and mini DisplayPort, eschewing USB-C or Thunderbolt 3. Microsoft The power connector appears to be the same one that's used for the Surface Pro 3 and 4. Microsoft The palm rest is covered with a soft fabric, much like the Surface Pro's keyboard cover. Microsoft The laptop in burgundy. Microsoft And the system interior does have an unusual touch: the keyboard tray is fabric covered. Microsoft shipped a number of Type Covers for Surface Pro 4 with an imported Italian fabric called "alcantara," and the company uses it on the Surface Laptop, too. The color match between the fabric and the anodized aluminum appears pretty much spot-on; there are even matching Arc mice available in three of the four colors, and they match well, too. The fabric feels warm, with none of the hard metal edges found on many laptops as a trap for those who'd rest their wrists on the system. The Surface is comfortable enough—though I think I actually prefer the unusual soft-touch finish that Dell uses inside the XPS 13. But I wonder how well the Surface's cover will stand up to years of eating and drinking at the keyboard. The good looks are marred somewhat by little plastic inserts on either side, near where the ports are. They look as if they're a SIM card or perhaps SD reader, but I believe they're actually antenna cut-outs. It's a shame that the machine's otherwise impeccable styling is defaced in this way. On the inside, we find Microsoft's first (and presently only) Surface system to use Intel's latest-generation Kaby Lake processors. Slim as it is, the Laptop includes a fan, and the processors are the mainstream/Ultrabook-oriented U-series parts rather than the ultra low-power Y-series. The top models, with i7 processors, also have Iris Plus graphics. Even with these processors, Microsoft claims 14.5 hours of battery life. The Surface Laptop is sleek and elegant, but it's just a laptop. And unlike prior Surface systems, it's not striving to carve out a new category or push system design in a new direction, practically to a fault. You won't find USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 here; the Surface Laptop has a single USB 3.1 generation 1 Type-A port. No 10-gigabit-per-second generation 2; no Thunderbolt with all its exciting possibilities for docking stations or using a single cable to both connect an external monitor and charge. Instead, charging continues to use Microsoft's proprietary magnetic charging-and-docking connector. That connector means that the Laptop is compatible with the Surface Pro 4 Dock. But that feels like a poor trade-off to me, especially on a machine that Microsoft envisages being used for four or more years. USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 aren't the only recent innovations that the Laptop eschews. The gorgeous screen supports touch and pen input, though the pen is not included in the box. But the Laptop doesn't have a 360-degree hinge. This makes writing on the screen inconvenient at best; you'll need to hold it to brace it and stop it from moving around. 360-degree hinges add a ton of versatility to laptops (I love them for watching movies in the cramped conditions of a plane, and they make pen input much more practical), and I'm surprised that Microsoft hasn't used one here. The Surface line has long attempted to make pen input an integral part of people's workflows, and, with the Pro and OneNote in particular, Microsoft has seen quite some success in this area. But the Surface Laptop lacks that ambition. The pricing and availability also rather deviates from the ideal. It starts at $999. That gets you a measly 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a Core i5 processor. It also gets you platinum. The other three colors are only available in one specific configuration: 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, and the same i5 processor, which is $1,299. Go higher-end still and you're back to a choice of platinum, platinum, or platinum: 8GB RAM, 256GB storage, and an i7 with Iris Pro is $1,599, and 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and the i7 is $2,199. Everything is soldered onto the motherboard, so what you buy is what you're going to be living with for the duration, too. Systems start shipping on June 15. Enlarge / The part with the different color just to the right of the headphone jack is a plastic insert. Microsoft The Surface Laptop runs Microsoft's new Windows 10 S: the locked-down Windows 10 that can only run apps from the Store. This will soon include Office. While the major thrust of Windows 10 S is education systems in the same kind of price range as the sub-$500 Chromebooks used by middle- and high-schoolers, Microsoft's hope is that the Laptop, and machines like it, will extend the appeal and reach of Windows 10 S to audiences such as college students. These groups tend to be willing to pay a little more (hence the pricing being more in line with that of, say, the MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro). But whether they'll be willing to live with the constraints imposed by the Windows Store is, well, less than clear. Windows 10 S can, in general, be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for $50; Surface Laptop buyers who upgrade before the end of the year will be able to do so for free. Plenty of people whose needs aren't quite met by the Surface Pro or Surface Book have been calling for a "Surface Laptop." And this is what Microsoft has delivered. But I've often felt that the calls for a "Surface Laptop" never quite meant "Oh, just make a laptop and slap the Surface name on it." Instead, I've assumed they meant "Give us a laptop that retains the Surface trend of pushing new designs and concepts." The Surface Laptop has delivered on one level: it's a Surface-branded laptop, and it's an incremental improvement on the Surface styling. But on another level, I'm not convinced it quite delivers. It doesn't have that Surface twist. It's the Surface Laptop, yes, but it's the Surface, just a Laptop. Enlarge / The device will be available in a variety of colors, at least in some configurations. Microsoft Surface Pro—and, to an extent, even Surface Book—operated in new or under-served markets. This, in some ways, made its shortcomings and weaknesses excusable. We might have wished that, for example, the Surface Book had included USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. But there just aren't that many systems on the market offering its same combination of 2-in-1 hybridity and a discrete GPU with such a fine high-resolution screen (and there were even fewer when the Book was first launched). So the trade-off was acceptable. The conventional thin-and-light laptop market, in contrast, has many options and alternatives already, both from PC OEMs and Apple. I'm going to have to use the Surface Laptop much more extensively to truly get a sense of whether it and its extraordinary good looks do enough to distinguish it from its many peers, but the question is already much less clear-cut than it was with its siblings.

Also, the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting during which it is not expected to raise interest rates. Investors will eye Wednesday’s post-gathering statement for any clues about the odds of a hike at their June meeting. “The Fed’s outlook is really based on economic fundamentals, and if growth and the labor market trend does not hold up, that could cause the Fed to go slower,’’ Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities in New York, told Bloomberg. “If it heats up, that could cause the Fed to roll off the balance sheet earlier.” In 2.35pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent.

The stock touched a record high US$148.09 earlier in the day. And the stock might continue its gains. Active stock fund managers around the world are holding the lowest percentage of Apple shares in their portfolios when compared to the iPhone maker’s overall weighting in indexes, Reuters reported, citing a research note by investment bank UBS. “Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,” Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York, told Reuters.

We have been or facing a couple of years of very strong headwinds into that business,” ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano said on a conference call with analysts, according to Reuters. “With ample stocks around the world, there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades,” Luciano noted. Net profit attributable to ADM rose to US$339 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, up from US$230 million, or 39 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said in a statement. Shares of Mosaic also dropped, trading 7.6 percent weaker as of 1.46pm, after the US maker of fertiliser posted quarterly earnings that missed expectations amid lower phosphate and potash prices. Mosaic swung to a net loss attributable to the company of US$900,000 for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of US$256.8 million, a year earlier, it said in a statement.

But the Surface Laptop, expected to be fully released on June 15, will likely stand out from anything made by Apple. It sports a 13.5-inch screen, 14.5-hour battery life (or so Microsoft promises), a clamshell body, and a keyboard covered in Alcantara fabric, the same material used for premium Surface Pro covers. At the very least, the Surface Laptop won't look much like any other computer out there. It's available in four colors, has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen stylus. It comes in Intel i5 and i7 seventh-generation processor configurations, putting it on a par with other high-performance laptops. Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay said at an event on Tuesday that this laptop was born from students' need for a laptop — not a tablet, like Microsoft's Surface Pro, or a laptop-tablet hybrid, like the Surface Book. The one thing to know is that the Surface Laptop is the poster child for Windows 10 S, a new version of the operating system that Microsoft says is more streamlined and secure — and offers better performance and battery life — than the standard Windows 10. View photos microsoft surface laptopMore (Microsoft) The trade-off for those perks is that Windows 10 S won't let you install any software that's not from the Windows Store app market, which means that, at the very least, you wouldn't be able to install the Google Chrome web browser. If you're not down with that, Microsoft will let you switch any Windows 10 S computer, including the Surface Laptop, to the regular Windows 10 Pro for a one-time $49 fee — less if you're on a tablet or something else with a smaller screen. But if you do that, Microsoft says, it can't guarantee you'll get the improved battery life and performance. Here's the reveal trailer: Meet the new Surface Laptop. Performance made personal. pic.twitter.com/dk9BB0IPwL — Surface (@surface) May 2, 2017 Versus Apple At first blush, the Surface Laptop appears to fill an important gap in Microsoft's homebuilt hardware lineup, as it looks to go toe-to-toe with Apple and its premium Mac devices. Microsoft is pitching the Surface Laptop as perfect for college students — in line with the educational focus of its event on Tuesday in New York City. If the Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft's MacBook Air alternative and the Surface Studio is up against the iMac, then the Surface Book laptop is its MacBook Pro competitor — and its $999 price tag makes it a slightly cheaper alternative to the $1,299 MacBook. View photos microsoft surface laptopMore (Microsoft) Microsoft's Surface business seems to be struggling, as evidenced by a 26% revenue decline in the most recent quarter. Still, Microsoft has always said that a big reason it bothers with the Surface hardware lineup in the first place is to draw attention away from competitors like Apple while paving the way for Windows 10. The Surface Laptop is just another salvo in that strategy. Related: Watch Today Show on Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.

The new entry-level mobile computer comes in a convertible form-factor and is powered by Microsoft’s newly-announced Windows 10 S operating system. The device is aimed at students and will rival various Chromebooks from both Acer itself as well as other suppliers. The Acer TravelMate Spin B1 (B118) is based on Intel’s Apollo Lake platform featuring the Celeron N3450 SoC (four Goldmont cores clocked at 1.1 – 2.2 GHz, 2 MB cache, 6 W TDP, Intel HD Graphics 500 with 12 EUs) as well as Microsoft’s new Windows 10 S, which is a feature-limited edition designed primarily for the education market. Windows 10 S has a faster boot process and supports general features of the operating system (including the Cortana assistant), but can only run applications obtained from the Microsoft Store and has some additional limitations. The main purpose of the Windows 10 S is to enable Microsoft to better compete against Google’s Chrome OS-based laptops. One of the key selling points of the TravelMate Spin B1 (apart from the OS) is its 11.6” IPS display with a 1920×1080 resolution, which additionally features 10-point multitouch and has a 360-degree hinge supporting notebook, tablet, display and tent modes. The capabilities of the display look rather advanced for an entry-level PC, and as a further kicker, Acer supplies the computer with an active stylus that supports the Windows Ink technology. As for the other specifications, they seem to be in-line with other entry-level laptops available today. The TravelMate Spin B1 is equipped with 4 GB of DDR3L memory, 64 GB of eMMC storage, a dual-band 802.11ac 2×2 MIMO Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, a GbE port, USB ports, a webcam, an SD card reader, a touchpad, a spill-resistant keyboard, and so on.

The Acer TravelMate Spin B1 is available now from select retailers starting at $299.99 in the U.S. In the coming weeks and month, Acer plans to start sales of the product in other countries, but actual prices and configurations will differ there.

Reply TheTurboFool - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link The only way a Celeron can brutally beat anything is if the device it's in is used as a bludgeoning device. Reply vladx - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Pretty good specs for the price, also option to upgrade to full Win 10 Pro for 50$ is quite nice. Reply tuxfool - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link "4 GB of DDR3L memory" Uhuh. Reply vladx - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link For <$300 that's good enough, especially since the main purpose is to use it with the much leaner Windows S. No one should use this for intensive stuff like gaming, programming or video editing. Reply tuxfool - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Sure, but it means that it would be quite silly to upgrade it to full fat windows. Reply vladx - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link Not really, 4GB is enough for browsing, media consumption and office work. Heck, my old Windows tablet is still doing pretty ok running full Win 10 with only 2GB. Reply Alexvrb - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link I agree that I wouldn't bother upgrading the OS - if you need full Windows, you might be better off putting the extra money towards a more powerful device. However for non-gaming students, parents/grandparents, etc, this device has plenty. IPS, convertible, touch, 64GB internal - $300? Not too shabby. Devices like this have their place, even if some have a hard time seeing it (since they need the flexibility of full Windows). I'd like to see some testing on how fast Win S devices boot and resume. Reply webdoctors - Tuesday, May 02, 2017 - link 11.6” IPS display with a 1920×1080 resolution, which additionally features 10-point multitouch and has a 360-degree hinge SOLD! Take my money.

The company reported late Monday first-quarter results that were mostly in line with expectations, but analysts expressed concern over the margin outlook. With the stock more than tripling over the past year, Wall Street had set the bar very high. Don’t miss: The AMD of investors’ dreams is not a reality yet. The stock AMD, -24.23%  tumbled 24.4% to $10.30, the lowest close since Jan. 23, 2017. That’s the biggest one-day percentage decline since it plummeted 26.2% on Jan. 11, 2005. Volume rocketed to 266.6 million shares, which was more than five-times the full-day average and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. Analyst Christopher Rolland at Susquehanna Financial said AMD needed to have a “near perfect” quarter to justify the recent ramp up in share price, but the results fell a bit short. “AMD’s new products are beginning to accelerate growth, but perhaps without all the gross margin benefits we had hoped for,” he wrote in a note to clients. Rolland kept his rating at neutral, and his stock price target at $12, which is now about 17% above current levels. UBS analyst Stephen Chin affirmed his sell rating on the stock and $9 price target, which calls for a further selloff of about 13%, on concerns that the margin expansion story could take more time to develop. “We keep our sell rating on the stock as we see limited EPS growth near term to support its high multiple as it need to invest heavily to keep pace with Intel and Nvidia,” Chin wrote. “We also estimate limited operating margin expansion in the near term.” AMD has a price-to-earnings ratio for next-12-month estimates of 148.6, according to FactSet, compared with Intel Corp.’s INTC, +1.82%  13.0 and Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA, -2.96%  37.0. Analyst Ruben Roy at MKM Partners said AMD appears to be executing largely according to plan, with the shipment of its new Ryzen desktop processors during the first quarter, and the results didn’t change is fundamental view of the company. However, the margin outlook is a concern as the shares appear fairly valued. “While we do not find lumpy gross margin performance all that surprising as AMD transitions into a number of new product launches, we do understand investor disappointment with a step back given the buzz around Ryzen,” Roy wrote. The stock was now down 9.2% year to date, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -1.06%  has run up 10.8% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.12%  has gained 6.8%.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Analysis  ⋮  Finance  ⋮  Hardware AMD Q1 2017 Quarterly Earnings Breakdown – Stock Plummets More Than 24% After First Ryzen Quarter By Usman Pirzada 10 hours ago 25Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD (NASDAQ: AMD 10.30 -24.38%) announced its earnings for the first quarter of 2017, or the “Ryzen Quarter”, and immediately saw its shares plummet to what is one of the worst crashes in the stock’s history. Before we go into details of the market correction, a quick overview of the earnings: the company generated a revenue of $984 Million, which is a healthy increase from the same quarter last year (17%), on which it netted a loss of $73 Million on a GAAP basis ($38 Million on non-GAAP basis). Loss per share was 8 cents, and adjusted loss per share clocked in at 4 cents a piece. Our Take On AMD (NASDAQ: AMD 10.30 -24.38%) – Earnings and Market Correction Analysis: Should You Buy? Disclaimer: I own no stock in Intel and/or competing companies and have no plans to do so for the foreseeable future. The analysis and forecasts given here are provided “as is”. At the time of writing, AMD’s stock closed at $10.3, down 24.38% from the the $13.62 level just a day ago. In one day, the stock has wiped out almost 1/4th of its market-value making it the worst trading day in almost a decade of the company’s stock performance. Support seems to have kicked in at the $10.3 level and appears to be holding although a slight downward trend can still be seen in after hours trading. The support levels for the stock are as follows: Immediate Support Level: $9.75 Secondary Support Level: $8.39 The volatility of the stock remains very high and I would urge extreme caution while dealing with the stock in the short term. There will continue to be some pricing weakness in the stock, and I expect it to hit immediate support levels if things take a turn for the worst. The thing to keep in mind is that AMD’s current price level is courtesy of a very heavy speculative premium. In other words, it was built on hype and while the company delivered solid financials, they weren’t the multi-fold increase the premium asked for: which resulted in the market correction you saw. Before we go any further, here is a quote from the company’s CEO on earnings day: “We met our strategic objectives in 2016, successfully executing our product roadmaps, regaining share in key markets, strengthening our financial foundation, and delivering annual revenue growth,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. “As we enter 2017, we are well positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.” Now that the price has taken a 24% hit, is it finally a good time to jump on-board the AMD(NASDAQ: AMD 10.30 -24.38%) ship? Well, there are arguments both for and against doing so and depends primarily on your risk appetite but one thing is for sure: do not take the crash as a discount, since it isn’t one! This was a market correction to converge some of the hype towards reality and the vast amount of speculative premium (and therefore risk per dollar) will still remain. That said, the company’s fundamentals are solid and have only grown stronger this quarter so it is still a go for the long term play. AMD released its anxiously anticipated Ryzen architecture as well as revealed details about Naples and the Vega GPU this quarter. Ryzen 7 (in the start of the quarter) and Ryzen 5 (near the end) were both released and marked the first time the company had been competitive in the x86 segment in quite a few years. In fact, the processors offered an incredible value proposition to customers and more or less had delivered on what the company had promised. The company’s Compute and Graphics segment saw a cool 29% increase in revenue, which is pretty great under normal conditions, and acceptable when considering Ryzen. Advertisement One of the major charges that caused the disparity between GAAP and Non-GAAP results is the charge of $342 million to WSA thanks to the 6th amendment, which basically ensures that Ryzen’s supply is un-affected by any potential issues originating from Global Foundries. This is also one of the reasons why investors were probably expecting a more clear indicator of an AMD(NASDAQ: AMD 10.30 -24.38%) comeback in the x86 sector – which did not happen at the levels which justify such costs. However, there are some caveats to this line of thinking. Ryzen has only just arrived and initially ran smack dead into some early teething issues with software and optimization. Not only that but the lack of motherboard supply meant that potential sales were lost this quarter due to the failure of AIBs to keep up with demand. Then there is the fact that our anecdotal evidence taken from in-house polls showed that the Ryzen 5 lineup has a lot of demand (potentially even more than the Ryzen 7) and was launched at the far end of the quarter where it could not nudge the bottom line by much. All of these factors mean that the performance of Ryzen is still not in black and white (which is what the market is reacting like) as far as financial impact and growth goes, and will actually become clear in the next quarter. In fact, barring any unforeseen supply issues and both Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 lineups fully in the game, Q2 2017 will be a major turning point for the company’s stock. It is with this in mind, that I would once again urge caution to any investors who do not have the appetite for this level of risk – if Ryzen does not show consistent and expected growth in the next quarter, then we could see the price blowing past more support levels as more of the speculative premium evaporates. Financial Summary Revenue of $984 million was up 18 percent year-over-year, driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business segments. Revenue was down 11 percent sequentially, due primarily to seasonality in both segments. However, Computing and Graphics segment revenue decline was better than seasonal due to the initial sales from high performance Ryzen™ desktop processors. On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially due to a higher percentage of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment, as well as a richer product mix within that segment. Operating loss of $29 million compared to operating losses of $68 million a year ago and $3 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $73 million compared to net losses of $109 million a year ago and $51 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.08 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.06 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP(1) basis, gross margin was 34 percent, up 2 percentage points year-over-year and sequentially. Operating loss of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $55 million a year ago and operating income of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net loss of $38 million compared to net losses of $96 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Loss per share of $0.04 compared to a loss per share of $0.12 a year ago and a loss per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory.

The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher desktop and graphics processor sales. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mobile and graphics processor sales largely offset by initial revenue from high performance Ryzen desktop processors. Operating loss was $15 million, compared to operating losses of $70 million in Q1 2016 and $21 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by lower operating expenses. Client average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and sequentially driven by desktop processor ASP. GPU ASP increased year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to higher desktop GPU ASP. Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $391 million, up 5 percent year-over-year driven primarily by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Sequentially, revenue decreased 23 percent primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. Operating income was $9 million, compared to an operating income of $16 million in Q1 2016 and an operating income of $47 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher server related R&D investments, partially offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower sales of semi-custom SoCs. All Other operating loss was $23 million compared with operating losses of $14 million in Q1 2016 and $29 million in Q4 2016. The year-over-year and sequential differences in operating loss were related to stock-based compensation charges. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD 10.30 -24.38%) Outlook for Q2 2017 For Q2 2017, based on a 13 week quarter, we expect: Revenue to increase 17% q/q, plus or minus 3%. The midpoint of guidance would result in a y/y increase of 12%. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 33%, Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $370 million, THATIC JV licensing gain of approximately $20 million Non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million, and Inventory to be down versus Q1 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Verge: ‘Microsoft’s Surface Laptop feels beautiful’ Microsoft finally made a real laptop, and it’s beautiful. I got a chance to get a closer look at the new Surface Laptop during Microsoft’s event in New York City, and I’m impressed. This could be the laptop I’ve been waiting for Microsoft to create. The Surface Book was always a little too top-heavy and chunky, but this new Surface Laptop is under three pounds and feels high end, thanks to its aluminum finish and design. Microsoft has made some interesting hardware choices here, and they genuinely add up to an impressive Windows laptop at first glance. The first thing I noticed about the Surface Laptop is that you can open it with a single hand. That might not sound impressive, but it’s one of the most irritating experiences you’ll notice across a range of laptops these days. You try to open a device to work and it jumps around on the table. The Surface Laptop just stays still, as if it’s bolted to the desk. Once I started typing I also immediately felt the alcantara fabric that surrounds the keys and trackpad. Microsoft’s Panos Panay wasn’t joking when he said it feels warm. It’s an unusual fabric to have on a laptop; it feels like glowing leather underneath your palms. My only concern will be liquid and food spillages, but it seems to be coated in a way that it’s probably not an issue. We’ll see when we review the Surface Laptop. Inside the Surface Laptop on the base model, which will debut on June 15th priced at $999, is Intel’s latest Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD. Microsoft is using a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, running at a 2256 x 1504 resolution, along with support for the Surface Pen and touch. It’s a 3:2 aspect ratio, so it looks just like a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book display. I noticed there’s still a little bit of screen wobble when you touch the display, like most Windows laptops, but the hinge and body of the laptop feel study otherwise. Microsoft has made the Surface Laptop display look like it’s glued directly to the keyboard without a hinge, thanks to a repositioning of the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas. That repositioning creates the only ugly part of the Surface Laptop design in my opinion. There are antenna lines on each side of the Surface Laptop, just like you’d find on smartphones like the iPhone 7. On the right-hand side there’s a Surface connector for power and connections to docks, and on the left there’s a regular USB port, a mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. Unfortunately, Microsoft hasn’t added USB-C here, and that’s disappointing given that the majority of high-end laptops are shipping with at least one USB-C port. Microsoft is claiming battery life will be 14.5 hours on the Windows 10 S, and that you’ll be able to put the device to sleep and resume it days later without any loss of battery. Windows 10 S is the operating system that powers the Surface Laptop, and it’s designed to only run apps from the Windows Store, which means traditional desktop apps will need to be specially packaged to work with the Surface Laptop. If you want to use Chrome, you’ll have to wait for Google to list it in the Windows Store, or pay $49 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and unlock every desktop app. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge An extra $49 for the functionality you’d expect from a Windows laptop seems like a bad idea from Microsoft. Fortunately, Microsoft is allowing potential Surface Laptop owners to avoid the fee until the end of the year, and throwing Office 365 Personal in for free so it should be a non-issue for early adopters, at least. Operating system aside, I love the design of this Surface Laptop. I rarely get impressed by Windows laptops, unless they do something truly unique. Microsoft hasn’t done anything unique here to change the idea of a laptop, but it’s clear the company has focused on what actually matters. The keyboard and trackpad feel great, the display looks crisp, and it’s all packaged into a design that looks and feels beautiful. I’m excited to review the Surface Laptop, and if Microsoft’s battery life claims are accurate then this could be the Windows laptop I’ve been waiting for.

Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Tuesday was  Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) which traded up 1.89% at $36.99. The stock’s 52-week range is $29.50 to $38.45.

FILE - In this Feb. 26, 2015, file photo, Federal Communication Commission Commissioner Ajit Pai speaks during an open hearing and vote on "Net Neutrality" in Washington. Tech companies are readying for a show... By TALI ARBEL Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) - Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday. Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to "approach" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon - which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would "result in a worse internet for consumers." Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix - has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Quotient Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Crisp Mobile Combined company expands Quotient’s capabilities in shopper marketing Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 02, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Quotient Technology Inc. (NYSE:QUOT), a leading digital promotions, media and analytics company that connects brands, retailers and shoppers, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Crisp Media, Inc., which does business as Crisp Mobile. A mobile marketing and advertising company, Crisp has a proven track record of delivering successful shopper marketing campaigns for consumer packaged goods brands (CPGs) and retailers. Crisp’s deep mobile media expertise, coupled with its advanced technology platform, complements Quotient’s existing promotions and media offerings and is expected to position Quotient to better take advantage of what’s predicted to become a nearly $19.0 billion market1 in the next few years. “Crisp is a natural fit for Quotient as we expand our efforts in shopper marketing,” said Mir Aamir, President and Chief Operating Officer of Quotient. “We believe the power of our retail network and proprietary shopper data, combined with Crisp’s ability to create and deliver premium and effective mobile ads for CPG brands, puts us in a strong position as the industry rapidly shifts to digital. Additionally, Crisp expands and strengthens our ability to attribute media campaigns to in-store sales.” Already, Crisp has strong relationships with leading ad agencies and CPGs in the US, working with them to drive in-store sales at specific retailers through interactive mobile advertising. Crisp’s platform seamlessly links data, personalized creative messages and analytics to reach the right shoppers at the right moment on their path to purchase. Shopper marketing, long the realm of end-of-aisle promotions and point-of-purchase signage, has rapidly transformed as shopper marketing teams turn to mobile to reach shoppers with key product offers and messages before they shop, in store, and after they shop. That is exactly what Crisp has become so skilled at doing. “We’re thrilled to join Mir, Steven and the Quotient family,” said Jason Young, CEO of Crisp. “There is tremendous opportunity within shopper marketing to reach millions more shoppers digitally than traditional tactics can provide, and we believe Quotient’s scale, solutions and data will make a great combination with the mobile shopper activation business we’ve built at Crisp over the last several years.” While Crisp will operate as its own brand, Quotient will take advantage of the natural synergies. Young, who comes with 20 years of media experience at Ziff Davis Inc., where he ran the digital media business and eventually served as CEO, will continue to run the team. He will report to Mr. Aamir. Crisp is headquartered in New York City, with field representatives at key locations, including Bentonville, Arkansas; Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and Atlanta. Crisp is backed by Meritage Funds, Intel Capital and EDB Investments. Acquisition Details The Company will pay approximately $33.0 million in upfront consideration, comprising cash and stock of $20.0 million and $13.0 million respectively (approximately 1.2 million shares valued based on a 90-day volume weighted average trading price) subject to certain adjustments at closing. Additionally, contingent consideration of up to $24.5 million in cash may become payable upon the achievement of certain financial metrics over a period of one year after closing. The deal is expected to close by the end of Q2 2017. Conference Call Information Management will host a conference call and live webcast to further discuss the acquisition during its Q1 2017 earnings call today at 4:30 p.m. EDT/ 1:30 p.m. PDT.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall Street rises as Apple climbs to record Margreet Dietz Wednesday May 3, 2017 Share ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano says the agbusiness is facing strong headwinds. Play NBR radio on All three major benchmarks rose as Wall Street absorbed new corporate earnings reports. Also, the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting during which it is not expected to raise interest rates. Investors will eye Wednesday's post-gathering statement for any clues about the odds of a hike at their June meeting. "The Fed's outlook is really based on economic fundamentals, and if growth and the labour market trend does not hold up, that could cause the Fed to go slower,'' Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities in New York, told Bloomberg. "If it heats up, that could cause the Fed to roll off the balance sheet earlier." At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.43 points, or 0.2%, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.06% higher to 6095.37, again touching a record high 6102.72, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 0.1% to 2391.17. The Dow rose, as gains in shares of Intel and those of Visa, up 1.4% and 1.2% respectively, outweighed declines of Procter & Gamble and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 1.0% and 0.8% respectively. Apple hits new high Shares of Apple, which reports its latest quarterly earnings after the market close, traded 0.4% stronger and touched a record high $US148.09 earlier in the day. And the stock might continue its gains. Active stock fund managers around the world are holding the lowest percentage of Apple shares in their portfolios when compared to the iPhone maker's overall weighting in indexes, Reuters reported, citing a research note by investment bank UBS. "Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally," Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York, told Reuters. Energy stocks, the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year, fell 0.5% as a slide in crude prices pressured oil companies. US crude for June delivery lost 2.4% to $US47.66 a barrel, posting its second lowest settlement for the year. While the latest round of US earnings has generally exceeded expectations so far, some disappointed. Grain gluts sinks ADM Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader, warned that massive global grain stocks are making it difficult to turn a profit trading grain internationally, Reuters reported. ADM shares sank 8.4%. "We're working very hard in ag services to continue to improve our operations. We have been or facing a couple of years of very strong headwinds into that business," ADM chief executive Juan Luciano said on a conference call with analysts, according to Reuters. "With ample stocks around the world, there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades." Net profit attributable to ADM rose to $US339 million, or 59USc per share, in the quarter ended March 31, up from $US230 million, or 39USc a share, in the same quarter a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said in a statement. Mosaic books loss Shares of Mosaic dropped 7.6% after the US maker of fertiliser posted quarterly earnings that missed expectations amid lower phosphate and potash prices. Mosaic swung to a net loss attributable to the company of $US900,000 for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $US256.8 million, a year earlier, it said in a statement. Even so, the company is upbeat about the outlook. "We are seeing positive developments in the phosphates industry following a challenging 2016," Joc O'Rourke, chief executive officer, said in the statement. "Realised product prices are rising, demand continues to be strong and we believe China is in the process of restructuring its industry. For the remainder of 2017, we expect improved margins in our phosphate business as we begin to realise the benefits of improving market conditions and completed plant maintenance." Government bonds strengthened, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note falling to 2.296% from 2.327% on Monday.  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.8% gain from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index rose 0.6%, as did the UK's FTSE 100 Index, while France's CAC40 Index added 0.7%.

Ford recently announced its plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, a start-up formed just in December whose focus is the development of autonomous vehicles. Similarly, last year GM invested $1 billion when it acquired Cruise Automation, another AI start-up. Of course, the decision to invest in AI is not limited to traditional OEMs, as demonstrated with Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye. Once organizations make this type of investment, they face some serious talent concerns: How can they make sure the new employees from the startups they acquire assimilate smoothly into their organization? And how can they attract the right talent from outside to maximize their investments? It all starts with getting the culture right. Do your cultural due diligence: Take the time to study the start-up organization’s culture and how it handles delegation of authority, work environment, budget and cost approval, travel policies, values and style of communication. Ask questions like: How many people are needed to get something approved? Who needs to decide which customers, suppliers, markets, products and technologies will be priorities?  How many cost and profit centers are there, and how well do they work together?  What is the span of control for managers? How long does it take to approve a job opening and get someone hired and working? How hard is it to gain access through purchase or licensing of new technology or software?  How complicated are contracts with the company?  Comparing these answers to the existing policies, processes, and practices at the established enterprise will identify gaps in culture that will need to be bridged to enable motivation and success for the acquired business. Popular Now 3 Keys to Successful Globalization The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter Last Mile: The New Frontier in the Retail Supply Chain Design for success: In their book Leading Innovation, authors Jeff Degraff and Shawn E. Quinn explore how to unlock innovation, identify and remove barriers, and align business practices to the value propositions across various elements of the enterprise. To design for success and encourage the creation of cutting-edge ideas and applications requires an environment that rewards risk-taking, experimentation, failure and innovation. This means going beyond a traditional R&D model of a big corporation which often focuses on incremental development with proven markets and services that substantiate a return on investment case.  There may even need to be an entirely different business model to support experimentation and innovation within the enterprise ecosystem. That may mean changes in: organizational design; hierarchy within the organization; policies and practice; levels of approval; span of control; compensation; reward and goal setting; and basic ways to measure progress, performance and outcomes to enable and foster the innovative outcomes desired. And, as the outcomes from the new capability centers begins to integrate into the legacy business operating model, the entire enterprise may need to adapt and transform to be more agile to unlock the value of the innovation and compete effectively. Apply right-minded leader or mentor: Key to successful integration is having an integration leader from the legacy organization assigned to the new team. This person needs to be of the right mindset and perspective—someone who has a strong sense of emotional intelligence, flexibility and agility to have a foot in both the traditional and evolving worlds and be credible in both organizations within the enterprise and know how to “get things done” when dealing with non-conventional decisions and actions. And this person will need to understand the objectives of both and be able to manage and make both the new and legacy elements succeed, with the goal of bringing the two worlds of the organization together to help maximize potential towards joint success. Communication is key: Over-communicating will be crucial, so that both organizations understand one another and get to see the mutual benefits in each other. Communicating the shared joint success, and celebrating the strengths and contributions of both, needs to be kept front and center every day. This will help foster a sense of teaming, by acknowledging what each group is contributing to jointly create this new team and culture and tapping into the energy of that promise and celebrating for everyone involved.  Brian Heckler is national sector leader of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG LLP.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Internet of Things (IoT) Market Research Report 2017 Analysis and Forecast to 2023 New York, NY — (SBWIRE) — 05/02/2017 — Internet of Things (IoT) Market: The 2017 study has 678 pages, 240 tables and figures. Worldwide Internet of Things (IoT) markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of sensors, cameras, and platforms that are used to help implement precision digital control and send alerts for all manner or management of devices and machinery. Visualization and digitization let people better control any device or mechanical thing. Providers of Industrial IoT aim to implement asset efficiency solutions. Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product. There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. Scalability is achieved by the Bosch IoT Suite and ProSyst IoT middleware. The Vorto code generator enables M2M modelling. PTC supplies the Thingworx Application Enablement Platform (AEP), used for creating dashboards, widgets and other user interface elements. Intel provides the Moon Island Gateway used for data aggregation at the edge, as well as horizontal infrastructure in collaboration with HP. Hitachi analytics is used to diagnose manufacturing process. Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. Request Sample Report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/1243091-internet-of-things-iot-market-shares-strategies-and-forecasts-worldwide-2017 The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. „Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport.” Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for digital tracking devices in industry, healthcare and consumer markets. Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse. Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts. Not too many and not too few.

The dossier, compiled by shady former British spy Christopher Steele, raised allegations that Russia had compromising intelligence on the sitting US president. From the get-go, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the 35-page memo as “pulp fiction.”  © REUTERS/ Carlo Allegri/File Photo Is FBI Investigating Trump Over Moscow ‘Golden Shower’ Orgies? Steele simply “made it up,” Trump told the Times. The dossier “has been totally discredited, number one. Number two, [California Congressman] Adam Schiff is totally partisan, as partisan as you can get,” he added. Schiff is the top ranking Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee.  The Republican chairman of the House Intel committee, Devin Nunes, was forced to step aside from the Trump-Russia investigation after making “unauthorized disclosures of classified information,” on television, according to Nunes. “Number three, the Russia story is a fake story,” Trump continued. Democrats conjured up the narrative to justify “the fact that Hillary Clinton lost an election that a Democrat should not lose because it’s almost impossible for a Democrat to lose the Electoral College,” he pointed out.  “Not only did she lose, she lost by a lot,” he boasted.  © Photo: Pixabay John McAfee: 'I Can Promise You It Wasn't Russia Who Hacked the DNC' At Saturday’s White House Correspondent’s Association dinner, keynote performer Hassan Minhaj said  “I want to root for you guys, but you’re turning into conspiracy theorists every night. You’re like, ‘the Russians hacked our elections! The Russians hacked our elections!’ Meanwhile, everybody in Latin America and the Middle East is like, ‘ohhh, a foreign government tampered with your elections? What is that like? Do tell, MSNBC!’” “Just pump the breaks! We’re only on Day 100. By the end of the year, you’re all going to have tinfoil hats and jars of urine all over your desks,” Minhaj added. ...

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Microsoft unveils touchscreen Surface Laptop, its $999 MacBook rival Christian Zibreg on May 2, 2017 13 At its educational event held this morning in New York City, Microsoft unveiled Surface Laptop, its $999 MacBook rival available for preorder beginning today ahead of its planned release this summer. The device runs the new Windows 10 S operating system, the company’s answer to Google’s Chrome OS, and features a clamshell body weighing at 2.76 pounds and measuring 14.47mm at its thickest point and tapering down to 9.9mm at its thinnest point at the front. Taking on MacBooks Surface Laptop runs either Intel’s seventh-generation i5 or i7 processor and sports vapor chambers integrated into the anodized aluminum finish on the rear to help keep it cool. It’s got a 13.5-inch PixelSense LCD touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio featuring 3.4 million pixels (withCorning’s Gorilla Glass 3 for protection) and supporting the Surface Pen stylus. “This is the thinnest LDC touch model every created and put into a laptop,” says Microsoft’s Panos Panay, who took to the stage to unveil the new products today. Say hello to Surface Laptop Watch a reveal trailer for Surface Laptop below. The laptop is outfitted with a 14.5-hour battery. That’s “up to four more hours of battery power than a 13-inch MacBook Pro” and “more battery life than any MacBook Air on the market today,” says the Windows maker in another comparison between its new notebook and Apple’s MacBook line. The Windows maker claims you can watch as many as fourteen episodes of your favorite TV show in one sitting, without ever plugging in. The device’s keyboard has a 1.5mm travel, with the backlit keys made from the same material used for premium Surface Pro covers, called Alcantara fabric. The speakers are integrated underneath the keyboard, but there are no speaker grills or holes. In terms of connections, Surface Laptop comes outfitted with a regular USB port, mini DisplayPort and the conventional Surface power connector, but no USB-C. Windows 10 S or Windows 10 Pro? Because it runs Windows 10 S, Surface Laptop can only run apps offered on Windows Store. Google Chrome is not found on Windows Store and Spotify’s app with support for Surface Dial will be coming to the store early this summer. If you want to run apps not found on Windows Store, you can optionally upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for a one-time $49 fee. Because Windows 10 Pro is the full version of Microsoft’s operating system, upgrading may result in reduced battery life and performance, cautions the Windows maker. If you need to use an app that isn’t in the Windows Store, in just a few clicks can go to the Windows Store and switch to Windows 10 Pro. But you shouldn’t. This device, this OS, they’re made for each other, and together they offer so much. It’s everything you love about Windows, Office, and Surface, made pure and elegant in an unbelievably thin and light package. Microsoft now has three families of Surface devices in its lineup: the Surface Pro 4 notebook/laptop hybrid, the all-in-one Surface Studio and the new Surface Laptop. Availability and pricing Surface Laptop is available for pre-order via Microsoft Store starting today. The entry-level $999 model uses Intel’s seventh-generation Core i5 processor with Intel HD Graphics 620, four gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of flash storage. The $1,299 model uses 256 gigabytes of flash storage and eight gigabytes of RAM. The more powerful $1,599 model comes outfitted with Intel’s seventh-generation Core i7 processor with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, eight gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of flash storage. The flagship $2,199 model upgrades your storage and RAM to 512 and sixteen gigabytes, respectively. Surface Laptop comes in four colors: Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue and Graphite Gold. The notebook will start shipping this summer on June 15. For a limited time, Surface Laptop comes with an offer for one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal and one terabyte of free storage on OneDrive, giving you full access to Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Tagged: Apple Education Laptop Mac MacBook Microsoft News Surface Surface Laptop Windows Windows 10 Windows 10 S MORE FROM iDB iTunes 12.5.4 is out with support for TV app, Touch Bar-enabled scrubber & more Microsoft: more Mac users than ever switching to Surface over MacBook Pro “disappointment” New Surface ad wants you to think that your Mac “ain’t fast enough” Chinch07 They also have the SurfaceBook don’t they? so they have four types of surface devices. Surface Pro, SurfaceBook, Surface Laptop, and Surface Studio Gil True Christopher Lim Pretty sure they also sell the Surface 3 (non-pro) João Almeida hahahhaa looks exactly like a macbook.. even the video MS, not today burge And every time you turn it off it will want to install updates. Iskren Donev Windows 10 S is pretty much Windows RT 2.0. I am a fan of the concept, so I wish them the best of luck. Something curious: I believe I cracked the inspiration behind the ‘S’ label – it just so happens that ‘S’ is between the letters ‘R’ and ‘T’, hence Windows RT 2.0. GUY Wow! Didn’t you see that in the video at 1:14? The girl is sliding her finger at the bottom of screen while the screen shows a colorful yellow/red smoke pretty much like the one used on the MacBook pro , this is definitely Microsoft throwing shade at Apple’s tough bar … Funny and smart move from MS I’m a Mac and I’m a PC : the surface strikes back. ravinigga Yep but the slider make more sense on the touchbar so u see full content on the big screen(in my opinion) JohnS So after spending up to $1,500 you find that “If you need to use an app that isn’t in the Windows Store, in just a few clicks ” [and $50 more dollars] ” you can go to the Windows Store and switch to Windows 10 Pro. But you shouldn’t. This device, this OS, they’re made for each other, and together they offer so much. ” [except for all the apps that aren’t in the App Store] ” It’s everything you love about Windows, Office, and Surface, made pure and elegant in an unbelievably thin and light package. So apparently, making hardware so cheaply that it actually comes with a warning to only run the stripped down version of your OS (if you want that long battery and performance you bought it for) is a feature now? David J Delgado So it’s a handicapped Surface, made to resemble and compete with a MacBook, but running a crippled version of Windows 10 that only runs Store apps and, if you want to install other apps, requires a $49 upgrade to Windows Pro which, for the record, “Microsoft can’t guarantee battery performance.” Hmm…. It also looks a lot like a MacBook.

I got a chance to get a closer look at the new Surface Laptop during Microsoft’s event in New York City, and I’m impressed. This could be the laptop I've been waiting for Microsoft to create. The Surface Book was always a little too top-heavy and chunky, but this new Surface Laptop is under three pounds and feels high end, thanks to its aluminum finish and design. Microsoft has made some interesting hardware choices here, and they genuinely add up to an impressive Windows laptop at first glance. The first thing I noticed about the Surface Laptop is that you can open it with a single hand. That might not sound impressive, but it’s one of the most irritating experiences you’ll notice across a range of laptops these days. You try to open a device to work and it jumps around on the table. The Surface Laptop just stays still, as if it’s bolted to the desk. Once I started typing I also immediately felt the alcantara fabric that surrounds the keys and trackpad. Microsoft’s Panos Panay wasn’t joking when he said it feels warm. It’s an unusual fabric to have on a laptop; it feels like glowing leather underneath your palms. My only concern will be liquid and food spillages, but it seems to be coated in a way that it’s probably not an issue. We’ll see when we review the Surface Laptop. Grid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Microsoft claims the Surface Laptop will last for 14.5 hours Inside the Surface Laptop on the base model, which will debut on June 15th priced at $999, is Intel’s latest Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD. Microsoft is using a 13.5-inch PixelSense display, running at a 2256 x 1504 resolution, along with support for the Surface Pen and touch. It’s a 3:2 aspect ratio, so it looks just like a Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book display. I noticed there's still a little bit of screen wobble when you touch the display, like most Windows laptops, but the hinge and body of the laptop feel study otherwise. Microsoft has made the Surface Laptop display look like it’s glued directly to the keyboard without a hinge, thanks to a repositioning of the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas. That repositioning creates the only ugly part of the Surface Laptop design in my opinion. There are antenna lines on each side of the Surface Laptop, just like you’d find on smartphones like the iPhone 7. On the right-hand side there’s a Surface connector for power and connections to docks, and on the left there’s a regular USB port, a mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. Unfortunately, Microsoft hasn’t added USB-C here, and that’s disappointing given that the majority of high-end laptops are shipping with at least one USB-C port. Microsoft is claiming battery life will be 14.5 hours on the Windows 10 S, and that you’ll be able to put the device to sleep and resume it days later without any loss of battery. Windows 10 S is the operating system that powers the Surface Laptop, and it’s designed to only run apps from the Windows Store, which means traditional desktop apps will need to be specially packaged to work with the Surface Laptop. If you want to use Chrome, you’ll have to wait for Google to list it in the Windows Store, or pay $49 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and unlock every desktop app. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge An extra $49 for the functionality you’d expect from a Windows laptop seems like a bad idea from Microsoft. Fortunately, Microsoft is allowing potential Surface Laptop owners to avoid the fee until the end of the year, and throwing Office 365 Personal in for free so it should be a non-issue for early adopters, at least. Operating system aside, I love the design of this Surface Laptop. I rarely get impressed by Windows laptops, unless they do something truly unique. Microsoft hasn’t done anything unique here to change the idea of a laptop, but it’s clear the company has focused on what actually matters. The keyboard and trackpad feel great, the display looks crisp, and it’s all packaged into a design that looks and feels beautiful. I’m excited to review the Surface Laptop, and if Microsoft’s battery life claims are accurate then this could be the Windows laptop I've been waiting for.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Analysts Badly Split Over AMD Earnings Results: What You Need to Know One thing's for certain: AMD lost money last quarter. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 2, 2017 at 12:21PM Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and "initiate coverage" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... For months, analysts on Wall Street have been singing the praises of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), arguing that AMD is gaining strength in PCs, in artificial intelligence, and in computer deep learning. But yesterday, AMD reported its financial results for fiscal Q1 2017, and all of a sudden, not all analysts are certain AMD is as good as it looked before. Shares of AMD tumbled as much as 20.6% in Tuesday morning trading after those earnings came out, and analysts are deeply divided on what they mean. Here are three things you need to know. Few analysts were shocked when historically unprofitable chipmaker AMD lost money again in Q1. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The bull case for AMD On the plus side, AMD satisfied analyst expectations for earnings yesterday, reporting 18% growth in revenue, and quarterly losses just one third ($0.04 per share) of what the company lost one year ago ($0.12 per share). TheFly.com confirms that these numbers basically met the expectations that analysts had set for the stock -- $0.04 per share in losses, on revenue of $984.4 million. Investment banker Wells Fargo, which has an outperform rating on AMD stock, quickly hailed the results as proof that AMD is "continuing to execute well," as the TheFly reports. Accordingly, Wells raised its price target on AMD stock to a range of $13 to $15 per share. Canadian banker Canaccord -- likewise an AMD backer with a buy rating -- argued that AMD's Ryzen line of desktop CPUs is gaining traction in the market. The analyst doubled down on its buy rating, and continues to insist that AMD's stock, which was priced at $13 and change before earnings, and which sold as low as sub-$11 on Tuesday, is worth at least $17 a share. 2. Bears respond But not all analysts are enthusiastic. Goldman Sachs for example, which made a bold call against AMD stock earlier this year, zeroed in on weak guidance at AMD as supporting its thesis that the stock is "priced for perfection." Operating costs are rising, warns Goldman, while free cash flow has already turned negative at AMD. Accordingly, Goldman is also doubling down on its rating -- sell -- and cutting its price target to $10.60 per share. Citigroup, meanwhile, is even less certain of AMD's chances. Rating AMD stock a sell as well, Citi sets its price target at just $4 a share. Why? Says Citi, while AMD has raised revenue guidance for the current second quarter of 2017, the company cut its gross margin guidance by 60 basis points, which implies that added revenue may not add much to AMD's profit. Even more worrisome, Citi points out that AMD's "inventory and valuation are at the all-time highs despite the company losing money," writes TheFly. Finally, Australian banker Macquarie has just chimed in with an actual downgrade of AMD stock, cutting AMD to underperform (with a $10 price target). In a note covered on StreetInsider.com, Macquarie echoes Citi's concerns that margin expansion "will prove to be a challenge," and warns that any market share AMD is gaining from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will quickly be lost again to Intel when it cuts prices on its chips to win back customers from AMD. And with AMD warning that its gross margin is already starting to ebb, AMD may not be able to survive a price war against Intel. 3. What AMD said So how bad was AMD's report, actually? Pretty bad -- and certainly worse than media reports, which have been focusing on AMD's pro forma numbers, let on. By the pro forma standard of non-GAAP financial results, AMD lost only $0.04 per share last quarter, which as I said above was a two-thirds improvement from last year's Q1 pro forma loss of $0.12. Under GAAP accounting standards, however, AMD lost $0.14 per share in Q1 2016, and cut that loss by less than half in Q1 2017, to $0.08 per share -- twice the size of the pro forma loss that AMD bulls are citing. Free cash flow, as Goldman Sachs pointed out, ran negative to the tune of $322 million in cash burnt during the quarter. Meanwhile, on the guidance front, AMD: is projecting revenue growth of only 12% year over year in Q2. forecasts gross margin of only 33% (and only pro forma) in Q2 -- down from Q1's 34% gross margin. promises only pro forma profits for the full year -- not GAAP profits. The most important thing: Can AMD turn profitable? So how should investors make sense of all the above? Here's how I look at it: AMD did what analysts expected it to do last quarter, but really, since they expected it to lose money, that's not something to boast about. Moreover, AMD has lost money every year for the past five years, and burned cash in most of those years as well. Although AMD briefly turned slightly free cash flow positive last year (generating positive free cash flow of $13 million on sales of $4.3 billion according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), AMD is once again back to burning cash and losing money in Q1 2017. Meanwhile, AMD is guiding toward only moderate growth in sales next quarter, and promising weakening profit margins, which sounds a lot like what the AMD doomsayers have been predicting -- that AMD might gain market share temporarily, but would quickly suffer the ill effects of a price war as Intel, NVIDIA, and other chip rivals fight back for their lost share. To me, none of this sounds like a scenario that will end in AMD breaking its historical pattern of losing money and burning cash. Put me in the bears column on this one. If you own AMD stock, now seems like a good time to declare victory, take profits, and seek a more viable business to put them to work in. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023 ·         There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. ·         The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. ·         It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. ·         Worldwide Internet of Things (IoT) markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of sensors, cameras, and platforms that are used to help implement precision digital control and send alerts for all manner or management of devices and machinery. Visualization and digitization let people better control any device or mechanical thing. Providers of Industrial IoT aim to implement asset efficiency solutions. Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product. There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. Scalability is achieved by the Bosch IoT Suite and ProSyst IoT middleware. The Vorto code generator enables M2M modelling. PTC supplies the Thingworx Application Enablement Platform (AEP), used for creating dashboards, widgets and other user interface elements. Intel provides the Moon Island Gateway used for data aggregation at the edge, as well as horizontal infrastructure in collaboration with HP. Hitachi analytics is used to diagnose manufacturing process. Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, „Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport.” Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for digital tracking devices in industry, healthcare and consumer markets. Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse. Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts.

May, 2017, 12:28 ET Share this article NEW YORK, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Highlights ·         The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023 ·         There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. ·         The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. ·         It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. ·         Worldwide Internet of Things (IoT) markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of sensors, cameras, and platforms that are used to help implement precision digital control and send alerts for all manner or management of devices and machinery. Visualization and digitization let people better control any device or mechanical thing. Providers of Industrial IoT aim to implement asset efficiency solutions. Designing the asset efficiency solution, developing the application, adapting advanced engineering knowledge for the use cases, and supplying the information platform is the composite task of the analytics engine. IBM is a premier supplier of an analytics engine with its Watson product. There is enormous variety in the Internet of things markets. Bosch supplies industrial IoT sensor technology, acquiring data from the edge, providing device management. Scalability is achieved by the Bosch IoT Suite and ProSyst IoT middleware. The Vorto code generator enables M2M modelling. PTC supplies the Thingworx Application Enablement Platform (AEP), used for creating dashboards, widgets and other user interface elements. Intel provides the Moon Island Gateway used for data aggregation at the edge, as well as horizontal infrastructure in collaboration with HP. Hitachi analytics is used to diagnose manufacturing process. Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, "Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport." Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for digital tracking devices in industry, healthcare and consumer markets. Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse. Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts.

The Surface Laptop has performance, features and design that will redefine the category, said Panos Panay, corporate vice president at Microsoft during an event in New York City on Tuesday. The 13.3-inch laptop is the first pure laptop in the product line and offers an elegant design. Microsoft's other portable Surface devices include the Surface Pro, which is a tablet, and the Surface Book, which is a 2-in-1. The Surface Laptop is 14.5 millimeters thick and weighs 1.25 kilograms. It runs on Intel's Core i5 or i7 processors based on the Kaby Lake architecture, and has up to 1TB of SSD storage. The device will ship on June 15. The entry-level Surface laptop with Core i5 is priced at $999. The Core i7 configuration isn't yet known. The device is priced high considering it doesn't have a discrete graphics processor, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. But it's got an amazing design, he said, adding that Microsoft now has a full stable of PC products in its arsenal. It runs on Windows 10 S, which is targeted at students.Â With Windows 10 S, you'll be able to only run apps available through Windows App store. That gives it functionality much like a Chromebook. Other PC makers will ship Windows 10 S laptops starting at $189 later this year.Â The Surface Laptop, though, will perhaps be the most powerful laptop based on Windows 10 S, which was also launched on Tuesday. The device can be upgraded to Windows Pro for those who want to run apps not in the Windows App store, but it's not known if the upgrade, which would make it a full-blown laptop, will cost extra. The Surface Laptop is lighter and faster is than any MacBook Air or Pro in the market, Panay said. He spent close to half an hour explaining the nitty-gritty: There are no hinges, bumpers or screws visible, and it has a smooth finish. The device has a touch screen, and can display 3.2 million pixels, like other Surface devices. It supports the Surface Pen for note taking and drawing on screen. The battery life is about 14.5 hours, according to Panay. The laptop will boot up quickly and can be placed in sleep mode without battery life being lost.
