For all the noise made around the deal — the largest ever cross-border sale of an Israeli tech firm — experts say only a small fraction of the sale sum will end up going into state coffers. Because Mobileye was not a privately held Israeli company, but a publicly traded company whose shares are now held mostly by international funds and institutional investors — the Israeli founders, initial investors and employees of the firm hold an estimated 25 percent stake — analysts believe that Israel will likely only see about $1 billion in tax money from the sale, and that may be an optimistic assessment. The Israeli tax authority declined to disclose an official figure due to privacy issues, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said by email. Professor Avi Simhon, the head of the National Economic Council, said in an interview to Israel Radio that the country is expected to gain some NIS 3 billion ($830 million) in taxes from the deal this year, and in the longer term the revenues will reach some NIS 10 billion, he said. To calculate the amount of taxes to be collected, many things need to be taken into account, including which owners have Israeli citizenship, the employees’ options, the capital gains they made, and whether the company is subject to special tax incentives in Israel. Amnon Shashua, co-founder and chairman of Mobileye, arrives at a Mobileye and Intel Workers Conference in Jerusalem, March 14, 2017. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) Yaniv Pagot, an economist and head of strategy for the Ayalon Group, an Israeli institutional investor, said that based on the assumption that some 25 percent of the shares are owned by the founders, initial investors and the employees, Israel is expected to get some $1 billion in taxes once the deal is completed. Mobileye was and for now remains a publicly traded company, at least until Intel conducts a tender to acquire the outstanding shares held by the public. In this tender, the date of which was not specified at the time of the announcement of the deal on March 13, a subsidiary of Intel will offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion, and a premium of 34 percent to Mobileye’s closing price before the deal was announced. A disclaimer on the Mobileye website indicates that the tender has not commenced yet. Mobileye’s Israeli founders, initial investors and its employees hold shares in the company. But the lion’s share of the deal money will go to the institutional investors and funds that were invested in the company. Based on data compiled from public filings by Bloomberg and companies like Yahoo Finance and Morningstar, the majority of these holders are US and global funds. To be fair, it should be remembered that the founders and some Israeli institutional investors have also reaped profit from the sale of stakes along the way, at the time Mobileye issued shares in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, for example, or at its secondary share offering in 2015. What becomes evident from scrutinizing the shareholder data is that no Israeli institutional investors are listed among the major shareholders, meaning that Israeli pensioners will be largely excluded from the bonanza. That is because Mobileye, like many other tech firms, preferred to list its shares in the US and not in Tel Aviv. “We know that company founders, initial investors, employees and insiders held approximately 23-26% of the company, and that the majority of non-insider holders were institutional investors and mutual funds from outside of Israel, primarily US and global index investors, and active investors,” said Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar indexes, a financial firm that has developed indices and exchange traded funds (ETFs) with a focus on the Israeli capital markets. “The only clear-cut losers from this massive Mobileye deal are Israeli institutional investors, and the Israeli citizens they serve,” he said. Ziv Aviram, president and CEO of Mobileye, demonstrates the driverless car to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2R) and former US president Barack Obama (C) during an exhibition of technological innovation at the Israel Museum as Amnon Shashua (R), Mobileye‘s co-founder and chief technology officer, looks on, Jerusalem, March 21, 2013. (Kobi Gideon / GPO /FLASH90 These Israeli institutional investors use the primary indices of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange – the TA-35 and the TA-125 — as their benchmarks, and Israeli companies that are listed abroad, on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and London, are not included on these benchmarks. Mobileye, Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd., Amdocs and Mellanox Technologies and Wix.com, for example, are not listed in Tel Aviv, and thus are not included in the local indices which are tracked by the local institutional investors. Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar indexes (Courtesy “Even though these investors can and could invest in Mobileye, they tend not to do so, or do so in very little amounts, because it is not their benchmark,” Schoenfeld said. “The risk/reward of holding a large position in a non-index stock is not worth it to pension funds and insurance managers, who are judged by how they perform relative to the TA-125 index.” Israel’s benchmark bluechip index, the TA-35 (it used to be the TA-25 until recently), includes Tower Semiconductor Ltd. a chip maker, Ormat Technologies Inc., a provider of alternative and renewable energy technology, Nice Systems Ltd., a software developer, and Elbit Systems Ltd. a defense systems manufacturer. The TA-125 index has companies such as AudioCodes, a maker of data networking products, Compugen, a drug discovery company, and medical device maker Mazor Robotics. But a big chunk of the Israeli technology firms are simply not on the exchange, and as a consequence not tracked by the Israeli institutional investors via the benchmark indices. “Had Mobileye shares been traded in Israel, they would have been included in the indices and then Israeli institutions would have held the shares because it is in the index,” said Ayalon’s Pagot. “Israeli pensioners are at the sidelines of this deal.” Pagot attributed the lack of prominence of the Israeli institutional investors in the stock to its price. “The company was trading at 100 times its reported earnings and 30 times its income, and that is not the kind of stock a portfolio manager goes for,” said Yaniv Pagot, chief strategist for Ayalon Investment House, an institutional investor. “The company was trading at a very high price, something that a strategic investor like Intel is ready to pay for and not so much a financial investor.” Israeli tech companies have spurned the local stock exchange and opted for offering their shares on the Nasdaq or NYSE to be closer to their markets, get higher valuations, and avoid what they see as burdensome local regulation. Mellanox Technologies Ltd., whose shares are listed on the Nasdaq, delisted from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2013, citing regulation as one of the reasons. At the end of 2016 there were 73 Israeli companies listed on the Nasdaq, according to data provided by the Bank of Israel. In addition, a 2014 report commissioned by the Israel Securities Authority to promote investment in publicly traded tech companies showed that Israeli institutional investors shy away from investing in technology shares because such shares are perceived as being more risky, investors often lack the expertise to understand the technologies involved, and tech companies are relatively small and don’t offer the liquidity these investors require. BMW, Intel, Mobileye announce cooperation for a driverless car, July 2016 (Courtesy) The Marker reported that Menora Mivtachim Holdings Ltd., one of Israel’s five largest insurance and finance groups and an institutional investor, held some 941,000 shares in Mobileye at a value of some $60 million at the time of the sale, with the other funds holding just a few million dollars’ worth of shares in the firm. “Israeli institutional investors can and are allowed to invest directly in technology shares like Mobileye and they have invested there in the past,” Moshe Bareket, a senior adviser to the US investment bank Jefferies, said in a phone interview. But these investors shy away from investing in stocks that are not included in the benchmark index. If they invest in a stock outside of the benchmark and if it performs badly, that is something they could get criticized for, he said. “There is a negative incentive not to invest,” he said. Bareket is a board member of and former chairman of Phoenix, and a former senior regulator at the Israeli Securities Authority. The lack of tech companies on its exchange, and the steady decline of Israeli companies choosing to go public, has prompted the Israel Securities Authority and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to spur efforts to ease regulations to encourage small and medium Israeli tech companies to list their shares with it. It has also started a project in which it provides investors with analysis about tech firms, to bridge the knowledge gap. Leonard Rosen, the chief executive officer of Barclays Plc in Israel, said in a phone interview that listing shares abroad for a company like Mobileye is essential for it “to be able to get access to the largest pool of capital in the world and to reach the widest group of investors.” Barclays was a bookrunner for Mobileye’s initial public offering of shares in 2014 and also its secondary offering in 2015. A bookrunner is usually the main underwriter or lead-manager in a securities offering. “If we want people to make investments in Israel they need to know that they can get a good return on their investment,” Rosen said. “It is better to be sold for $15 billion with only part of it coming into Israel, versus being sold for $1 billion, and never growing to achieve your potential, with all of it coming to Israel,” Rosen said.

Intel has revealed its new Optane SSD DC P4800X Series paired with its new memory drive technology to drive storage and memory architectures for the data centre. The new Intel Optane product is delivered as a unique form of storage compared to traditional storage as it significantly increase scale per server and can speed up applications. The Optane SSD DC P4800X, which can also be used as extended memory, expands the system memory pool to create bigger and more cost-effective memory to gain higher quality insights. This also enables data centres to deliver more affordable memory pools by displacing a portion of DRAM or significantly increase the size of memory pools. The solution works to integrate the drive into the memory subsystem and presents the SSD as DRAM to the OS and applications. Read more: New Intel software bolsters data centre security Also, the company’s Optane SSD DC P4800X Series is built to drive new solutions with innovative applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, faster trading and deeper insights into medical scans. This expands the reach of cloud computing solutions. Intel’s Optane SSDs are built to offer performance at low queue depth, with the majority of applications delivered to generate storage workloads enabling CPUs are more active and utilised. For the data centre, it allows users to perform more work with the same servers to improve TCO or expand capabilities. As the drive has been found to be responsive under any load, it is highly predictable and delivers a consistent ultra-fast service, according to Intel. The new product release comes shortly after Intel’s recent announcement of its new cryptographic isolation technology for the data centre (Intel SGX), which is delivered to enable application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel’s Optane SSD DC P4800X Series and its SD DC P4800X with Memory Drive technology is now available for customers in an early ship program, with all additional capabilities and form factors expected to be added in the second half of 2017.   Tags artificial intelligence Homepage News List Intel Machine Learning memory Optane Previous ArticleIBM Cloud woos financial services with developer tools Next ArticleWhat is big data?

We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents iPhones iPads iPad mini Apple Watch 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September Apple predictions for 2017: iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that. For a more in-depth look at the latest rumours on the Apple Watch be sure to check out our Apple Watch 3 Rumours article.

We think September Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly. Read more about the Apple TV: Apple TV (2015) review | Best Apple TV apps | Tips for using the new Apple TV Siri Remote | New Apple TV release date rumours When? We think WWDC Apple predictions for 2017: Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

Image: Patryk Kosmider/Shutterstock Mapping Ireland’s vast internet of things network reveals a web of collaboration and innovation. The internet of things (IoT) has grown from distant concept to near-realisation owing to the collaboration of many moving parts. Network providers, electronics manufacturers, R&D labs, multinational corporations, start-ups, innovators and strategic advisers have each made their contribution to the act of ushering in this new age of connected devices. In Ireland alone we can see how tightly knit the IoT ecosystem is, weaving together a broad spectrum of players. From networks to infrastructure to research to software, we can see how each component interacts with the others to make integral systems such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the industrial internet of things (IIoT) happen. Entrepreneurs and commercial partners are collaborating with universities and research centres. Forward-looking consultancies are not only writing the reports on IoT and its impact, they’re also working with their clients to develop and implement solutions. It’s all one big interconnected IoT family on this, the ‘island of things’. Accenture Global consultancy Accenture needs to stay on top of business-transforming technology. At its recently opened multidisciplinary research and incubation hub, The Dock, the company focuses its research on artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and the internet of things, hiring widely for talent interested in developing new IoT technologies. AMBER Last year, the Advanced Materials and Bio-Engineering Research (AMBER) centre at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) won a €4.4m Horizon 2020 research contract to develop a new class of magnetic materials for electronics.

They just need to join the dots. I have a tendency to repeat myself, especially on stage at conferences. A lot of the time, while I try to illustrate why I believe this little powerhouse of a country I call home has industrial prowess, I breathlessly intone how, when Intel came to Ireland in 1989 ,it set up in a little office within a car showroom on the Long Mile Road. Six years later, in the mid-90s, when the PC revolution was in full steam, half the Pentium processors in the world came out of Leixlip, Co Kildare. ‘As manufacturing moves towards the internet of things, it is crucial that we have access to graduates who are trained in state-of-the-art facilities’ – DENIS DOYLE The last time I trotted out this worthy allegory for how Ireland could succeed in the next industrial revolution was at a Tyndall Technology Days event in Croke Park last October. Afterwards, off stage, I had one ear on what one person was saying to me while scanning the room for where the coffee might be found. Suddenly, out of the throng emerged Eamonn Sinnott, country manager for Intel Ireland’s 4,000-strong manufacturing operation. “You may need to update your figures, John,” Sinnott said, smiling. “We now make half of the world’s supply of 14-nanometre processors.” This is significant. It puts Ireland at the bleeding edge of sophistication when it comes to making chips for the cloud – but also the internet of things – and secures the chip plant’s future for a long time to come. The Intel story reminded me of the occasion back in the 1990s when IBM brought a call centre investment to Mulhuddart, which was soon followed by manufacturing and more. After decades as a sales outpost, then-country manager William Burgess had higher ambitions and was intent on bringing further investment into Ireland. At the opening of the call centre, someone among the assembled press and dignitaries made a dry remark about call centre jobs not being very high-end. Burgess remarked back that this would only be the beginning. He was right. Today, IBM employs over 3,000 people across a vast tech campus in west Dublin that is engaged in a variety of very high-end activities from R&D to cloud, software, analytics, design, internet of things and cognitive computing. The examples of IBM and Intel are a testimony to the ambitions of talented local management who see beyond the horizon and the limitations, and think big. Are we ready for the next industrial revolution? You betcha! The machines age, or the internet of things age, is being characterised as the next industrial revolution, or Industrial Revolution 4.0. It will take all the sophistication of our smartphones and personal computers, matched with a tapestry of sensors joined together by wireless networks, data centres and the cloud. It will mean data gathering at a pace never seen before and the crunching of that data in real-time. For historical and economic reasons, Ireland definitely missed out on the first industrial revolution and narrowly saw some of the tracks laid for the steam age. But when it comes to the age of sensors and robots, will we have an edge? The economic quagmire of post-empire Ireland saw several decades of talent waste until the economic and educational policies of Lemass and TK Whitaker turned the Irish from the flotsam and jetsam lost on the tides of the world into a vibrant raw material that would finally bring the gold home. This time around, the visionaries won’t be just local managers of multinationals, they will be entrepreneurs and academics who see an opportunity to steal a march on the march of the machines. The island of things The reason I believe a small country like Ireland could bound ahead in the internet of things (IoT) revolution – and associate revolutions in the form of artificial intelligence and machine learning – is because I have already seen the evidence. The industrial revolution 4.0, as it pertains to Ireland, won’t be just a multinational job creation movement, it will be an indigenous effort too. And, as PCH founder Liam Casey famously remarked, in this new industrial revolution “geography will be history”. PCH is integral to the design and delivery of the high-end smart devices consumers crave globally, while IBM, HP, SAP, Vodafone, Analog Devices, Intel, Qualcomm, SAS, EMC and many others are working on IoT in Ireland. Dublin-headquartered Cubic Telecom is behind the technology powering the wireless hotspots in the newest Audi vehicles and has attracted an €18m co-investment from the German car giant and Qualcomm. Last year, DecaWave revealed that it now has 1m installations of its internet of things chips, which are capable of finding anything to within 10 centimetres. The metaphor of Pentium is no accident, and Irish company Movidius has developed a chip technology that will, in effect, be the Pentium of the machine age, capable of machine-learning and doing things like enabling smartphones to sense the dimensions of a room. It was no accident, therefore, that Intel acquired Movidius last year for a rumoured $300m. Ireland was also recently selected as the latest location for an Intel internet of things Innovation & Development Ignition Lab, where Intel will collaborate with local companies to develop technologies for the IoT marketplace. Dairymaster, a Kerry company investing big time in agritech R&D, utilises sensors, accelerometers and GPS to good effect, with genuinely innovative devices that help with the complex nature of farming. There is also the $2m investment by Taoglas in an IoT centre in San Diego. The Wexford company’s IoTx Centre is the first facility of its kind in North America. Taoglas, which develops antenna technologies for IoT, actually makes an annual turnover of around €32m and has ploughed its profits back into the company. On the research front, academic and industrial collaborations facilitated by groups like Tyndall, Amber, CRANN, Insight, Connect, Adapt and TSSG have put Ireland on the world stage for IoT-related breakthroughs. In Cork and Waterford, research institutes Tyndall and TSSG have signed a memorandum of understanding to draw down €82m from the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme to fund 10 IoT start-ups. Both bodies are also leading the charge on collaboration in fields like smart agriculture, where IoT sensors and smart grids could transform what is still Ireland’s biggest industry. In recent weeks, we reported how Artomatix, a Dublin-based artificial intelligence company founded by Trinity PhD graduate Eric Risser, raised €2.1m in a seed round. The Mayo town of Crossmolina is going to be the first town in Ireland to roll out a smart lighting system. US tech firm Silver Spring Networks, whose technology manages 23.6m devices in cities across the world, has deployed an IoT network canopy for Mayo County Council for smart street lighting, and a residential energy-efficiency project for the council, with the project being funded in part by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Last year, VT Networks completed the rollout of a nationwide Sigfox network across Ireland. Large mobile operators like Vodafone and Three are also spearheading a lot of the action on the machines age front. Two years ago, Vodafone embarked on a €2m industrial IoT venture with Dell-owned EMC in Cork. Vodafone Ireland CTO Madalina Succeveanu recently revealed that Ireland will be one of the first countries where the telecoms giant will trial NB-IoT, the wireless standard mobile operators are backing for the IoT world. Currently, around 12pc of mobile connections in Ireland are machine-to-machine (M2M). Three is responsible for 50.1pc of that figure, according to recent ComReg figures. Three’s CTO David Hennessy told Siliconrepublic.com that NB-IoT will also be arriving on its networks in Ireland. “We have a big 4G network and the intention will be to provide NB-IoT on that in the next 18 months,” he said. A meeting of minds and machines The new Coonagh campus in Limerick will be an IoT powerhouse. Image: Limerick IT While all of this activity is positive, there are still barriers to entry when it comes to accessing talent and bringing indigenous companies into the fold as a hyper-connected, data-centric world becomes a reality. The key here is education. While Ireland slowly brings coding onto its second-level curriculum, new ideas and new approaches will also be required at third level. Hybrid degrees that bridge business, software, hardware and logistics will need to be formulated. The entire approach to traditional areas like supply chain management (SCM), for example, will need to be re-imagined, with academic qualifications that take SCM from the clipboard in a warehouse to orchestrating the movement of goods at a global level. Computer science, for too long focused solely on software, will need to be repurposed and brought back to its traditional foundations in hardware and electrical engineering. TSSG at Waterford Institute of Technology is already on the case on this one, and has devised the world’s first internet of things degree designed specifically for computer science students. In December, Limerick Institute of Technology got the go-ahead for a €14m campus at Coonagh, which will be an IoT engineering and manufacturing centre of excellence. “As manufacturing moves towards the internet of things, it is crucial that we have access to graduates who are trained in state-of-the-art facilities,” said Denis Doyle, vice-president and general manager in charge of US and Ireland manufacturing operations at ‎Analog Devices. It is clear that Ireland has all the moving parts, bright and ambitious executives, and a track record that belies the country’s scale on the global stage. Just as Liam Casey said that geography is history, Ireland can nimbly navigate the issues of scale and become a world leader in the machine age. All it takes is ambition, imagination and hard work.

The technology comprises a transistor-less cross point architecture, hence the name. This creates a 3D checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. This means that the data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to faster and more efficient read/write processes. Intel's first 3D XPoint product, the Optane DC P4800X SSD, is aimed at the data centre, with the firm claiming that it fills a gap created by costly DRAM and lacking NAND performance.  According to Intel, the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than leading SSDs at low queue depths, making it "ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." What's more, the company says that it will allow for 2GB/s random read and write speeds, and terms of pure throughput, Intel says the drive is roughly three times as fast as its DC P3700 drive - an NVMe drive capable of delivering 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. Intel's Optane SSD, which the firm claims will be particularly useful for analytics and machine learning, also offers improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service, or up to 91 per cent lower cost per transaction.  The P400X, which will initially clock in at 375GB via a PCIe card of U.2 drive, will consume 12-14 watts under a heavy load, which is slightly more power-efficient than competing high-end NAND solutions. "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage," the firm said. "With an industry-leading combination of high throughput, low latency, high QoS and ultra-high endurance, this innovative solution is optimised to break through data access bottlenecks by providing a new data storage tier." The Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD is available now for $1,520, albeit in limited availability. The firm says that a 750GB PCIe model, alongside a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor, will b released in the second half of the year.   Intel also has a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 models, in the works.

The company also announced other Optane SSD variants, which would be released to the market this year.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Intel released its Optane solid state drive (SSD) in January, but the memory capacity was limited to just 32 GB. However, it has now unveiled Optane SSDs that have a much higher memory capacity. The chipmaker took the wraps off the Optane SSD DC P4800X series, as well as the Optane SSD DC P4800X series with Intel Memory Drive technology, on March 19. The company dubs them the most responsive SSDs for data centers. "Deployed as blazing fast storage or caching tier, Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X breaks the confines of traditional storage to significantly increase scale per server and accelerate applications. When deployed as extended memory, this drive expands the system memory pool, creating bigger, more cost-effective memory to gain higher quality insights," shared the company. New Optane SSD Series The first variant of the highly anticipated SSD series is the DC P4800X, which has 375 GB of storage capacity. It will retail for $1,520 from March 19, but has limited availability. The second half of the year will see the SSD become available widely. A 750 GB PCI-Express or PCI-E model is anticipated to make its way to enterprise users by Q2 2017. Per reports, Q2 will also see the arrival of a 375 GB model, which has the U.2 form factor. Moreover, a 1.5 TB PCI-E card - along with 750 GB and 1.5 TB U.2 sticks - will hit the market in H2 2017. Due to the Optane SSD's compatibility with the PCI-E or NVMe and U.2 slots, these drives are expected to run on some of AMD's 32 core Naples processors. Features Intel will supposedly also ship DRAM modules along with the SSD from 2018. However, the company has shied away from revealing when exactly these modules would hit the shelves. The Optane series has been touted as the superfast replacement to the older generation of SSDs. Intel has previously stated that these drives would be nearly eight times faster than the ordinary SSDs available in the market. Intel, along with Micron, has developed a new technology dubbed 3D Xpoint. This technology has been housed in the Optane line of products. The technology stores data by using the resistance of cells. The P4800X features low latency and possesses sequential transfer capabilities of 2,400 MBps for reading and 2,000 MBps for writing. Thanks to the low latencies, the P4800X is able to withstand high input and output loads. P4800X Vs. P3700 The P3700 was the fastest flash drive, in the context of random reading and writing data, from Intel prior to the arrival of the Optane series. Therefore, the P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD by Intel in a benchmark test. It was observed that in sequential tasks, the older-gen SSD performed better than the P4800X. However, when the data was recorded from a standard 4K block, it was revealed that the Optane was five to eight times faster than the P3700. Due to these test results, critics have commented that while the Optane technology shows promise, it lacks the polish found in the present flash SSDs.

The chip maker has unveiled the Optane SSD DC P4800X, a drive destined for the PCI Express or NVMe slots in servers. It only has 375GB of space, but its extremely low latency (typically under 10µs) and 2GB/s throughput means that it can serve as either a memory cache or storage. If you're involved in high-performance computing, online shopping or other categories obsessed with gobs of RAM and rapid turnaround times, this is theoretically your dream device, Engadget said. Intel also promises higher endurance than your typical SSD. The inaugural Optane model can withstand stresses normally associated with RAM, writing about 12.3 petabytes of data in its lifespan. You can get the drive right now if you're part of Intel's early shipping program, and there are promises of larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors coming later in 2017. Not that you're going to drop any of them into your gaming rig any time soon. The 375GB version costs a hefty $1,520 -- even if you could realistically buy one for home use, you'd get far more value out of a high-capacity conventional SSD. Optane won't be viable for mainstream PCs (outside of tiny capacities) until prices fall much, much lower, Engadget said. Related links: Engadget.

Is it memristor-based? Peter Bright (US) - Mar 20, 2017 7:45 am UTC Intel reader comments 173 Share this story Intel announced today the first Optane-branded product using its new 3D XPoint memory: the catchily named Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It's a 375GB SSD on a PCIe card. Initial limited availability starts today, for $1520, with broad availability in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, a 750GB PCIe model, and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor will be released, and in the second half of the year, a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 stick, are planned. UK pricing is TBC, but don't expect much change from £1,500. Further ReadingIntel and Micron unveil 3D XPoint, a brand new memory technology 3D XPoint is a new kind of persistent solid state memory devised by Intel and Micron. Details on how the memory actually works remain scarce—it's generally believed to use some kind of change in resistance to record data—but its performance characteristics and technical capabilities make it appealing for a wide range of applications. When it was first announced in 2015, Intel claimed it would be 1,000 times faster than NAND flash, 10 times denser than DRAM, and 1,000 times better endurance than NAND, though without saying "faster at what" or "what kind of NAND" or anything like that. With the shipping product, these comparisons are now clearer, as one of Intel's slides make clear: 3D XPoint has about one thousandth the latency of NAND flash (or about ten times the latency of DRAM), and tens times the density of DRAM. Further ReadingIntel 3D XPoint SSD specs: So-so transfer speed, awesome random I/OThe raw specs for the P4800X leaked in February. To summarise: it's a datacentre-oriented part, built for applications with high read/write loads, looking for low latency. The sequential transfer rates of 2400MB/s read, 2000MB/s write, are good, but some of the fastest NAND flash can pull slightly ahead. Where the P4800X excels is its ability to sustain high I/O loads, courtesy of those low latencies. Enlarge Intel SSD manufacturers often quote huge numbers of I/O operations per second (IOPS), but there's always a footnote: the figures are typically generated with queue depths of 32, which is to say, the drive is bombarded with read or write requests (depending on what is being measured) so that there are always 32 outstanding operations. With these deep queues, NAND flash SSDs can achieve 3-400,000 IOPS. The P4800X can do 550,000 read IOPS and 500,000 write IOPS, but critically, Intel says it achieves this even at low queue depths. The spec sheet figure has a queue depth of 16, and the company says that a queue depth of about 8 tends to be about the limit seen in the real world. Moreover, Intel says that the latency of each I/O operation remains low even under heavy load. 99.999 percent of operations have a read or write latency below 60 or 100 microseconds (respectively) with a queue depth of 1, rising to 150 or 200 microseconds with a queue depth of 16. Under a comparable load, Intel's own P3700 NAND SSD can only serve 99 percent of operations with a latency below about 2,800 microseconds. Likewise, under sustained write workloads, the P4800X retains its low latency for reads, whereas the read latency of the P3700 NAND steadily deteriorates as the write bandwidth increases. This already makes the Optane drive interesting for applications like caching, but Intel is aiming at more than just that. 3D XPoint is byte addressable; that is to say, each individual byte can be overwritten. This sets it apart from NAND flash. NAND is typically arranged in pages of 512, 2048, or 4096 bytes. Pages are arranged into blocks, typically of 16, 128, 256, or 512 kilobytes. Reading and writing takes place at page granularity, but each page can only be written once. To write it again, it must first be erased, and erasure takes place not at page granularity, but at block granularity. Spinning hard disks can perform reads and writes at the granularity of a sector, typically either 512 bytes (or 512 bytes plus some extra bookkeeping space), or 4096 bytes (or 4096 plus some extra). With 3D XPoint, the reads and writes can occur on individual bytes. Enlarge Intel Unlike flash, which physically wears out due to the stress placed by erases, 3D XPoint writes are non-destructive. This gives the drives much greater endurance than NAND of a comparable density, with Intel saying that Optane SSDs can safely be written 30 times per day, compared to a typical 0.5-10 whole drive writes per day. The low latency and high endurance make Optane a good fit for applications like caching and database servers. But taking further advantage of these two properties, Intel has developed a new way of using Optane. The P4800X can be used as a regular PCIe attached SSD, but Intel has developed something it calls "Memory Drive Technology" that allows the P4800X, when used in conjunction with an appropriate chipset and processor (which means you'll have to use a Xeon processor), can be used as if it were RAM. Optane's latency and bandwidth are both worse than that of DRAM, but the density is higher, and the price substantially lower. Enlarge Intel Memory Drive Technology uses a middleware layer that boots before, and is transparent to, the operating system, and it combines regular DRAM with the SSD to make a single large pool of volatile memory. For most workloads, this will be slightly slower than if the same amount of DRAM were being used, but the cost should be substantially lower, and the power consumption modestly improved. Intel even claims that some workloads will go faster; although Optane "memory" is slower than regular RAM, the middleware layer that manages the memory can move data around so that it is closer to the processor that is using it, which can assist when using NUMA configurations. The biggest benefit may be from substantially increasing the amount of physical memory in a server: 2 socket Xeon systems can hold up to 3TB of RAM, but 24TB of Optane, and 4 socket systems support up to 12TB RAM, but 48TB Optane. This could be a huge boost for applications that need truly enormous quantities of memory. If using the PCIe bus to attach storage and then use it as memory seems a bit awkward, next year Intel plans to release Optane DIMMS.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Storage Enterprise News 7 Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB model begins to ship by Mark Tyson on 20 March 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadfhv Add to My Vault: Intel announced its first market ready Optane products at the end of January, its low capacity (32GB) Cache SSDs. On Sunday the corporation released its first high capacity Optane SSD drive; the DC P4800X with 375GB of storage. According to PCWorld, this $1520 drive will be joined by a version with 750GB of storage in Q2, and a 1.5TB model in H2. Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X range is aimed at enterprises and fit in PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. Ahead of this larger capacity Optane SSD release, Intel had been hyping the storage performance of the technology as being up to 10X faster than a conventional flash SSD. It often refers to Optane as "a storage solution that behaves like system memory". In new benchmarks published (PDF) by Intel, the performance gain isn't so large or clear cut. These tests of the shipping product show that the first Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X "delivers 5-8x faster performance at low queue depth workloads, exhibiting extremely high throughput for single accesses and super low latency". Other strengths of the Optane SSD DC P4800X series are; responsiveness under load, predictably fast service (60x better than a high-endurance NAND SSD), and ultra high endurance with extended life. The above cases show that the Optane SSD DC P4800X series offers the kind of performance that is ideal for data centres and the acceleration of enterprise applications, says Intel. The drive series should enable users to increase the size of data sets to bolster 'big data' calculations. Its affordability means that Intel Optane SSDs are likely to displace some DRAM in servers. As reported by PCWorld, the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB model costs $1,520 and is available now. The price tags for the larger capacity members of the series, coming later in 2017, weren't divulged.

Posted by EvilCycle - Mon 20 Mar 2017 10:43 I would love one of these, but not at that price! I'm still unsure if I can even bring myself to buy an M.2 drive yet never mind this haha, I do need another SSD though as my current one is small and aging, I am probably better off just getting another standard Sata III one, as they ARE fast enough for my gaming rig at the end of the day.

I expect Optane drives for enthusiasts will be released later on… Posted by securitywyrm - Mon 20 Mar 2017 19:25 I could see the 32 gigabyte model being amazing for video games, particularly games with lots of loading screens. I imagine the difference between a HDD and SDD would be the difference between a SDD and one of these. Imagine playing Fallout 4 or Skyrim with 1/8th the loading time. Posted by uBronan - Tue 21 Mar 2017 05:09 Why would anyone want this drives.. seriously nothing for the home user. Your better off buying a pro, nvme or much cheaper a duo of (secodn hand) enterprise ssd I actually have both to be honest my main drive is the plextor PX-512m8 and i am kinda satisfied with it. As data drive i made a raid0 partition from 2 x 480 Gb samsung enterprise Mz7 series ssd and those show to be often a match to the nvme drive.. Many people expect way too much from the new nvme drives, when people would be really honest and could compare like i did most would be surprised how well the sata 3 (sata600) enterprise ssd perform yes in many cases they beat the nvme drives. Only when at some points the nvme show their muscle. I actually preffer the normal mlc-ssd over the nvme ones but they are yound so they might get better in time. Sadly plextor does not provide drivers for their product so improvements will not happen as with the samsung drives. ( could be a good thing as samsung adds spyware in their firmware ). Anyway if you use the benchmarks the nvme ofcourse win, but normal usage you really should not think the nvme is faster. Because the reality can be the absolute opposite in my experience. My other system with 2 x ocz vertex 4 - 250 Gb ssd showed they often get better performance.. I compared the samsung 961 from a friend with the plextor and then compared that ssd's again to the raid0 mlc-ssd and again showed with normal usage you hardly get any gains. So a much cheaper setup with a duo of those normal ssd does do the job faster. Even though the synthetic benchmarks show otherwise. You really do not need them, except if you run heavy modded games their you can see a huge performance gain. For instance when you play skyrim modded for 4k screen play. Then i really see faster loading. But to pay kinda triple or more the price of a comparable sized normal ssd is really not worth the money. You really are better off buying 2 ssd and put them in raid0 for near 1100 MB/s read/write speeds To compare the speed of the plextor read 2500 MB/s write showed 1400 Mb/s max and the samsung 961 gave 2900 Mb/s and 2200 Mb/s write. This ofcourse in the synthetic benchmarks.

Inbal Orpaz Mar 20, 2017 11:18 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Mobileye President & CEO Ziv Aviramon, CFO Ofer Maharshak, and Chairman Amnon Shashua, prepare to ring a ceremonial bell as their company's IPO begins trading, on the floor of the NYSE, Aug. 1, 2014. AP Start-up nation is being starved by the state Chief scientist warns budget cuts are endangering Israeli high tech When a start-up goes public or is sold for tens of millions of dollars, the high-tech crowd loudly celebrates. And when there is a giant deal, like Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye last week, the entire country sheds a tear. But the fact of that matter is that even in Start-up Nation the great majority of start-ups quietly fail – a phenomenon that is hardly acknowledged. “Many people enter this world naively, because the discussion surrounding it is so overly positive – because this is the Start-up Nation and it’s cool and trendy,” says Adam Benayoun, a partner in the American 500 Startups venture capital fund and a former entrepreneur. “There are people who do it because they think that can build an app and after a year sell it to Facebook and make a fortune. Even start-ups that managed an exit don’t always do so at a profit to their investors, says Benayoun, who joined a conference “Don’t Believe the Hype” sponsored by TheMarker on Sunday in Tel Aviv on the high-tech industry’s tendency of oversell itself. “Often when someone sells a company he struts around the neighborhood like a peacock, saying he sold a company. He doesn’t say, ‘You should know that I didn’t earn a shekel from the sale … Few people can stand up and say ‘I’ve been doing this for 15 years and still haven’t struck it rich,’” he says. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (L), Mobileye CTO Amnon Shahua and Klaus Froehlich, member of BMW board, view BMWi Inside Future concept car in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 4, 2017.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Glorious failures do get headlines, like Shai Agassi’s Better Place (an electric car network) and Dov Moran’s Modu (a pre-iPhone smartphone), which failed after raising hundreds of millions of dollars. But most of the start-ups die quietly in a dark corner, far from the public's eye. According to figures prepared by the high-tech research firm IVC Online for TheMarker, 653 start-ups that had been in business for at least four years closed up shop in Israel in 2014 – the latest year for which there are figures – up from 630 in 2013. By comparison, the number of companies started was 1,290. While companies hasten to announce fundraising rounds and product launches, few publicize when they go out of business, which makes tracking high-tech flops much harder. But IVC estimates that the number of start-ups that close each year is about half of the number formed, so that with big increase in start-up formations comes a big increase in failures years later. Israel isn’t alone Israel, of course, is not alone in the high rate of start-up deaths: A Harvard University study in America published in 2013 estimated that of 2,000 start-ups that received venture capital funding of at least $1 million in 2004-10, three out of every four failed to earn a profit for their backers. As much as 40% of the time, investors lost everything. But the phenomenon in Israel is arguably more significant. Start-ups are a big part of the high-tech industry – a source of jobs and capital inflows – and the number of start-ups has grown, in part due to the dreams of success that giant exits like Mobileye encourage. An electric car from the failed Better Place venture recharging its batteries. Tomer Appelbaum “There is a clear and logical correlation between the number of firms that are established and those that are closed – and we’re seeing an explosion in the number of firms being established in recent years,” says Koby Simana, CEO of IVC. “Over 10-15 years, the number of active technology firms in Israel has grown. Their number doubled from 3,700 in 2006 to 7,500 in 2017." The acid test for most start-ups is whether they can pass through the seed stage when the founders are formulating their product idea and vision, and the research and development stage. According to IVC figures, about 80% of start-ups trip up during one of those two phases and close shop. Only 20% shut down during the next stage, after they have begun marketing their product. Less than 1% of companies that died had reached the so-called growth stage, when they have sales of $10 million or more, says IVC. That said, only a tiny percentage of start-ups even reach the growth stage, which explains why they account for so few of Start-up Nation’s body count. "The point of failure in most cases is first contact with the market, when you’re trying to establishing what price you can sell you product or service,” says Simana. “Very few start-ups close at the idea stage because it didn’t work or there was no interest in it. Unfortunately, this stage can last a long time, which is unfortunate because if they knew [it would fail in the market] they could shut the company quickly and save the entrepreneurs and investors a lot of grief.” A study by CB Insights, a U.S. research house focused on high-tech, said that among 101 failed start-ups it surveyed, 42% gave up the ghost because the market wasn’t interested in their product, and another 19% reported losing out to competition. Another 29% that said they had simply run out of money and 23% said they failed because they never succeeded in assembling the right team. Smaller numbers cited problems about costs or pricing, and only 17% admitted they simply had a lousy product. Swelled-head warning Simana warns entrepreneurs against getting swelled heads because they have raised capital from outside investors. While it’s true that many start-ups fail because they can’t raise capital, many that have raised tens of millions or more, like better Place, still failed. Benayoun says the positive attitude that makes a good entrepreneur can often deter him or her from owning up to failure. Koby Simana.David Bachar “Entrepreneurs learn that they should never give up, that around the corner something good is waiting, so we see people working three and four years on a product without any users or making any progress on it. Their families suffer all that time,” he says. Benayoun says that when he meets with entrepreneurs he doesn’t want to hear about how well things are going. “Even the most successful companies have problems,” he explains. “The good companies overcome them, but everyone has to cope with them. Successful entrepreneurs know how to look into the heart of the matter and say ‘there’s a problem that I have to solve.’” He says there has to be a balance, which requires entrepreneurs to address a real need or problem, not to build their business on the idea that they have a fantastic product. “I’m bothered that media has romanticized the start-up world,” says Benayoun. “Only someone who has started a company knows after several years at it how hard it is. On the other hand, if everyone talked about how hard it is, Mark Zuckerberg might not have started Facebook.” Inbal Orpaz Haaretz Contributor Inbal Orpaz Send me email alerts for new articles by Inbal Orpaz Send Close Email * Please enter your email Inbal Orpaz For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

For decades, the company has provided a number of products that power the servers and perhaps most of the internet. Now, with the impending release of AMD’s Naples server processors, Intel is now forced to up its game when it comes to server products. Intel is rumored to release its Skylake EP Xeon processor anytime soon, nevertheless, a new leak seems to give a bit of detail about the upcoming server processor. It looks like Intel fans will have an interesting week ahead of them especially when a benchmark of a rumored server CPU surfaced online. The leak actually came from Geekbench, and from what it looks like, it pertains to the Skylake EP Xeon E5 2699 v5 processor. What is interesting about the leak is that the new server processor sports a total of 32 physical cores. This is surprising news because the original architecture where the server CPU is based is reported to only have a maximum of 28 cores. It would seem that Intel has made a last-minute decision to increase the number of cores for the Xeon E5 2699 v5 in response to the AMD Naples processor. Reverse side of rumored Skylake EP Xeon E5 2699 v5 (via vr-zone.com) Another interesting tidbit about the leak is the single- and multi-core benchmark scores. From the Geekbench website, one can see that the CPU in question managed to get a single-core score of 4044. For a server CPU running at 2.1GHz base clock, this is very impressive. In addition to an impressive single-core score, the multi-core score of the CPU is also staggering. The Xeon e5 2699 v5 managed to obtain a score of 48,088 for multi-core processing. Finally, the new server processor will boast a total of six memory channels as opposed to the current standard of four. It will also have support for Cannonlake graphics as well as FPGA integration. The Intel Skylake EP server processor will be released sometime in the early second half of 2017. It is also rumored that the CPU will make an appearance during this year’s Computex event in Taiwan.

We’ve been hearing about Intel’s new memory technology called the 3D XPoint since July 2015. While reports stated that it would be 1,000 times faster than traditional NAND flash at the architectural level, we haven’t really seen anything since its announcement. That changes now, though, as the company finally introduced its first 3D Xpoint drive in the line-up, the DC P4800X. Intel asserts that the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than the leading SSDs on the market, and also allows for 2GB/s random read and write speeds.  In terms of pure throughput (speed), the newly unveiled drive is about three times as fast as Intel’s traditional DC P3700 drive which according to GameSpot is a bold claim, since the latter can deliver about 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. The new Xpoint drive also utilizes the PCIe NMVe interface and comes with a new Optane controller. It can push up existing applications in one’s computer and uses about 12-14 watts under a heavy load. That makes it slightly more power-efficient compared to other high-end NAND solutions. The new Intel 3D Drive is bound for all work and no play However, before you get too excited about Intel’s latest SSD, there are a few things to keep in mind. For starters, the DC P4800X is not a drive for long sequential read and write sessions, which is useful in transferring large files. Intel notes that traditional high-end 3D NAND drives perform better at those particular tasks. Plus, it isn’t aimed at home users but for enterprise use. Digital Trends reports that the chipmaker promised the release of the consumer version later with larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors. If you have 200-series motherboards and Kaby Lake CPUs though, Intel states that you may still use the P4800X. However, the 375GB model of the SSD will run you a cool $1,520. That’s about $1000 more than the $300 a 512GB Samsung SM951 costs, so you’ll be paying quite a bit for Intel’s new chip. If that’s not a problem for you, you can get P4800X in PCIe add-in card form factor with a limited early-ship program, per Engadget. Its broad availability is yet to be announced but it should fall sometime in the second half of the year. What do you think of the new Intel 3D Drive? Is it worth the hefty price? Does it hold the potential to outpace other SSD solutions out in the market today? Voice out your thoughts in the comments section below!

Startups Games Makers Tech Games Hardware Software Features Women Blog Events How to Opinion Competitions Forum Press office Talk to us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Subscribe with RSS By Brendyn Lotz on 20th March · General · News Intel’s insanely fast 3D XPoint SSD costs almost R20 000 Solid state storage has come a long way in recent years but Intel is shaking things up with the release of its new Optane SSD DC P4800X. This SSD is designed to be a sort of midway between DRAM which is rather expensive to implement at scale and NAND which, while cheap and burgeoning with capacity just isn’t always fast enough. The P4800X then is the coming together of the best bits of these technologies built on the back of Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint technology which was announced back in 2015. This particular SSD has a capacity of 375GB and will have an initial price of $1520 (~R19 280). There are also plans to release 750GB and 1.5TB PCIe models and 375GB, 750GB and 1.5GB models with a U.2 form factor throughout 2017. Advert The initial release is limited so don’t expect to order one for your gaming PC, in fact putting this in your gaming PC would be doing it a disservice. The P4800X is primed for data center use thanks to its incredulous throughput speeds. The SSD is capable of 550 000 read input/output operations per second (IOPS) and 500 000 write IOPS according to Intel. The drive is also rather resilient as it will be used in data centers which write and rewrite swathes of data at a time. The manufacturer says the P4800X is capable of 30 daily writes per day or 12.3 petabytes. So while the likelihood of us mere mortals getting our hands on one of these drives right now might be a pipe dream but it’s exciting that this technology is out there and perhaps it will bleed into the consumer market sooner rather than later.

The technology comprises a transistor-less cross point architecture, hence the name. This creates a 3D checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. This means that the data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to faster and more efficient read/write processes. Intel's first 3D XPoint product, the Optane DC P4800X SSD, is aimed at the data centre, with the firm claiming that it fills a gap created by costly DRAM and lacking NAND performance.  According to Intel, the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than leading SSDs at low queue depths, making it "ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." What's more, the company says that it will allow for 2GB/s random read and write speeds, and terms of pure throughput, Intel says the drive is roughly three times as fast as its DC P3700 drive - an NVMe drive capable of delivering 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. Intel's Optane SSD, which the firm claims will be particularly useful for analytics and machine learning, also offers improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service, or up to 91 per cent lower cost per transaction.  The P400X, which will initially clock in at 375GB via a PCIe card of U.2 drive, will consume 12-14 watts under a heavy load, which is slightly more power-efficient than competing high-end NAND solutions. "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage," the firm said. "With an industry-leading combination of high throughput, low latency, high QoS and ultra-high endurance, this innovative solution is optimised to break through data access bottlenecks by providing a new data storage tier." The Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD is available now for $1,520, albeit in limited availability. The firm says that a 750GB PCIe model, alongside a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor, will b released in the second half of the year.   Intel also has a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 models, in the works. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Storage Intel SMB Spotlight SMB server Storage INQ Latest Half of Android devices are still not getting security patches But Google is working with vendors to make it easier Security 23 March 2017 Super Mario Run for Android is now available at Google Play Plumber finally clears blockage Games 23 March 2017 Apple acquires IFTTT rival Workflow and makes it free Deal hints at deep automation in iOS Applications 23 March 2017 'Windows 10 has a keylogger' story is back, three years after we first broke it Yeah.

The 410E targets applications for smart homes, digital signage, medical equipment, industrial automation, digital media players and smart surveillance. Both the processor and the board are distributed through Arrow Electronics. Projects undertaken to date with the Qualcomm board include an audio-controlled drone and a camera-equipped hat for the visually impaired that gives audio narration about the environment. The chipmaker is working to build a community that is actively inventing and sharing ideas. (The “c” in 410c stands for “community.”) Software support for the DragonBoard 410c stretches from the device to the cloud. At the operating system level, the board is compatible with Android, Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core. Middleware support includes Qualcomm’s AllJoyn, IBM Watson IoT and Robotics OS. Cloud services that work with the board include AT&T M2X, AWS IoT, IBM Bluemix and Microsoft Azure IoT. In addition, users can add a mezzanine board to make the 410c compatible with Arduino. Developers can use the board to create a “chip-down design” that can be implemented by purchasing the $16 Snapdragon 410E processors directly from Arrow. They can also use the board to prototype designs that will be implemented using single board computers or system on modules that use the 410E processor. Qualcomm’s ecosystem of IoT hardware providers includes development kits made by Inforce, Variscite, eInfochips, Intrinsync, Keith & Koep and Ka-Ro. Intel’s Galileo and Curie Intel has already launched two generations of its Galileo development board, which can be used as a client or a server. The board measures 123.8 millimeters by 72 millimeters and is powered by Intel’s Quark SoC 1000X processor. The board is compatible with the Arduino UNO R3 pin configuration so developers do not need extra hardware or software in order to attach an off-the-shelf Arduino-compatible shield to the Galileo board. For developers of wireless IoT products, Intel created a Bluetooth-enabled module called Curie. The coin-sized chipset is meant for developers of wearable devices and industrial edge products, and is a component of the Arduino 101 development board. The Curie module can also be purchased separately from the Arduino board. Curie is powered by Intel’s 32-bit Quark SE system-on-chip, which is said to be ideal for always-on applications, and can use a smartphone or Intel Bluetooth gateway to connect to the internet. Intel is planning a software development kit for Curie designed to enable developers to run a real-time operating system on the module. Gemalto’s Cinterion Concept Board and Cinterion Connect Shield Gemalto’s board is said to be ideal for developers who want cellular connectivity as it includes the company’s Cinterion M2M 2G/3G connectivity module, which supports voice, is compatible with Arduino and can be programmed using Java. This year, Gemalto launched the Cinterion Connect Shield for developers who want to use LTE Category 1 connectivity with Arduino. The shield attaches to Arduino boards and includes an LTE Cat 1 modem with 2G fallback, a basic set of sensors and an external antenna. Gemalto plans to migrate the shield to narrowband IoT technology during the second quarter of 2017. Gemalto says the Cinterion hardware provides the security and extended battery life needed for industrial IoT applications, smart cities, agriculture and other use cases that require connectivity for devices that are difficult to access on a regular basis. Executives from Gemalto, Qualcomm and Intel will be featured speakers this month at the Enterprise IoT Summit in Austin, Texas. They will join executives from AT&T, Verizon Communications, Texas Instruments, Telit and Silicon Labs in the IoT development kit content stream.

The initial offerings include enthusiast and gaming processors for the AMD Ryzen 7 series. A few weeks later, the company released the mainstream versions of its new Zen architecture, the AMD Ryzen 5 series. Now, rumor has it that the company is contemplating on going head to head with Intel’s extreme performance desktop processors. According to Overclock3d, AMD will be releasing a high-end desktop platform CPU within the next couple of months. This new CPU will be in direct competition with Intel’s HEDT line of processors, the Intel i7-6950X. Furthermore, the said processors will have a total of 16 physical cores and are based on the the same Zen architecture as the Risen chips. Just like the current Ryzen processors, this high-end product will also have Simultaneous Multi-threading of SMT. Therefore, the 16-core architecture will give a grand total of 32 virtual cores. In comparison to the new AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, the high-end CPU will have twice the memory channel as well as twice the core count. AMD Ryzen processor (via trustedreviews.com) To those who have been following developments regarding the new AMD Ryzen processors, this news may seem quite questionable. Especially when the current AMD Ryzen 7 1800X already outperformed the Intel i7-6950X in a number of benchmarks. However, if AMD’s plan is to officially oust Intel as the best desktop CPU, then having a 16-core counterpart for Intel’s high-end CPU is indeed quite attractive. For decades, Intel has monopolized the CPU industry with its overly-priced processors. Now that AMD has basically risen from the dead, the market will again see a healthy competition giving consumers viable options for computer builds. At the moment, AMD has yet to release an official statement about the rumored 16-core chip. The company is still in the middle of releasing the AMD Ryzen 5 as well as the upcoming AMD Naples server processors. Like with any other kind of rumors, this too should be taken with a grain of salt. For more updates on the AMD Ryzen processor, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Dubbed the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, the chipmaker says the drive is designed to be used as either a storage or caching product in data centers. The P4800X add-in card features a capacity of 375GB, latency of less than 10µs, 4K random read / write IOPS of up to 550,000 / 500,000 and an endurance rating of 12.3 petabytes written (PBW). Intel and Micron jointly announced 3D XPoint, the technology behind Optane, in 2015. The biggest benefit of Optane could have to do with boosting the physical memory of a server. Ars Technical highlights that two-socket Xeon systems can support a total of 3TB of RAM but up to 24TB of Optane while quad-socket systems can accommodate 12TB of traditional RAM and a whopping 48TB of Optane. Standard DRAM would be faster for most workloads but Optane would cost substantially less and offer modestly improved power consumption. In some instances, Intel claims, workloads could even be improved with Optane as the layer that manages it can move data around so it is closer to the processor using it. Intel’s Optane SSD DC P4800X is priced at $1,520 with limited availability as of writing. A 750GB PCIe version and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor are coming in the second quarter with a 1.5TB add-in card and a 750GB U.2 variant expected in the second half of 2017.

The performances bump these drives offer, according to Intel, will help drive AI and machine learning applications. SSDs are all the rage. For notebook computer I would strongly recommend against a spinning hard drive and on the desk, I’d advocate for either an all-SSD approach or OS and apps on a SSD with spinning disks reserved for mass storage where performance isn’t a priority. And the same goes for the data centre. The new drives are available now to the in Intel’s early shipping program with broad market availability and new capacities, starting with the first drive coming in at 375GB, and form factors coming in the second half of this year.

A huge amount of data will be generated by autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, and internet-of-things devices. Every day, more information is being collected and sent to faster servers in mega data centers, which analyze and make sense of it. That analysis has helped improved image and speech recognition and is making autonomous cars a reality. Emerging superfast data networks like 5G -- a melting pot of wireless technologies -- will dispatch even more gathered information, which could stress data centers. Servers are already being redesigned to handle more data, and throughput technologies like Gen-Z and fiber optics will reduce latency. At Mobile World Congress this week, computing on the edge was a big topic among infrastructure providers. Edge computing involves light processing on intermediary servers or on the edge of the networks. This type of computing can lead to faster responses for mobile services, without putting stress on servers in the core network. Edge computing can also provide instant analytics to ensure the junk information is discarded and only useful information reaches servers on the core network. Edge computing is also emerging for virtualization, which slices loads of data in smaller packages rerouted to the right servers to be handled. At MWC, many companies showed products and shared new ideas for computing on the edge. Most vendors had a common goal: to better control the flow and make better sense of data, especially with more data being collected by IoT devices. Hewlett Packard Enterprise showed off its latest generation of IoT servers called Edgeline, similar to the company's Proliant servers but slimmed down. The servers sit on the edge and are able to analyze data before sending them to core servers in data centers. The servers can virtualize data packets on the edge, which then makes better use of computing resources. For example, the Edgeline servers can handle mobile computing tasks, like responding to Facebook posts or search requests, on the edge. More intense data tasks, like image recognition, can be routed back to the centralized data center network, which handles machine learning tasks. Nearby, Dell was showing off its Edge Gateway 3000 servers for multiple IoT applications. The servers can analyze data at the point of collection and dispatch them to the data center. These servers use Intel's latest Atom chips, which have up to 16 cores. The Model 3001 is targeted toward industrial automation and energy management; the Model 3002 is aimed at transportation and logistics and fits into large vehicles like trucks; and the Model 3003 is designed for video streaming and point-of-sale applications. The servers use new Xeon-D or Atom chips from Intel, which were shown by the chipmaker on the floor of the show. The chips are targeted at edge servers and networking gear. These chips are not as powerful as the Xeon E5 chips used in mainstream servers in data centers. Ubuntu showed off some Open Compute Project network router designs with edge processing. The routers ran Ubuntu Snappy Core and can run software for edge processing. These routers are servers in their own right and reduce the load on high-end servers. Ubuntu "snaps" -- which are like apps -- can be tuned for specific edge processing tasks. More information about new edge router designs will be shared at Open Compute Project Summit next week. Another interesting demo at the Ubuntu booth showed an ARM server doing edge processing for 5G networks. The ARM servers had 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2 chips that are already being used in networking gear but also could double up as low-power server chips for more powerful edge processing. Powerful CPUs aren't needed for edge processing, but chips need to able to collate large datasets and ensure they are virtualized and redirected properly. ARM servers chips can virtualize data with the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, which has been adopted by chipmakers like Cavium. Edge processing will be important for autonomous cars as well. The ultimate vision is that autonomous cars will be able to connect to superfast servers in the cloud to recognize images, draw up maps, and make better driving decisions. But those connections may not always be possible, which is where edge processing on the autonomous car will step in. Intel and Qualcomm are providing unique circuitry for handling edge processing in autonomous vehicles. Intel is pushing FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) into autonomous vehicles to handle specific tasks, while Qualcomm is relying on digital signal processors. FPGAs and other components are key components for autonomous cars and a flexible 5G infrastructure, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and the Systems Architecture Group. Edge processing is also becoming a priority for telecom providers, which are looking for ways to add flexibility to the services they provide to customers. For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Junko Yoshida 3/20/2017 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet PARIS – On the day EE Times visited Chronocam, a Paris-based startup developing an event-based computer vision technology, a ripple of shock went through the whole building. Intel had just announced the acquisition of Mobileye. The big surprise hit shortly after a talk with the startup's CEO. This reporter closed her notebook, came out of the meeting room and proceeded on the obligatory company tour. Chronocam’s CEO reappeared unexpectedly, staring into his smartphone. Calmly, but with tones of deep portent, he said, “Intel just bought Mobileye. Fifteen billion dollars.” Say what? The move to combine Intel and Mobileye, two pillars of the computing and vision markets, carries far-reaching ramifications for everyone involved in the automotive market.   But what, for example, might happen to a startup like Chronocam? Although the CEO has never described Mobileye as a competitor, Chronocam’s technology, if successful, could overthrow the conventional CMOS image sensors and image processing algorithms currently used in cars, drones and robotics. The startup’s sensor technology, designed not for human consumption but for machines to sense and detect, would completely alter today’s CMOS image sensor market. Chronocam’s event-driven sensor, still so new, has not yet been used in any commercial cars, drones or robots. Experts in the imaging/sensing market see Chronocam at the crossroads of imaging and sensing.  Charting the course of image sensors over the next 15 years, Pierre Cambou, imaging activity leader at Yole Développement, considers Chronocam’s technology to be one of many disruptive technologies emerging as the industry shifts from an era of photography to machine sensing. (Source: Yole Développement) Click here for larger image Chronocam’s story is intriguing — even more so in the context of a red hot Advanced Assistance Driver System (ADAS)/autonomous vehicle market in which competition has escalated to the point that big players are now beginning to merge. Enter the combination of Intel and Mobileye. In the face of such super-combos, is Chronocam tilting at windmills? Will the Intel/Mobileye deal quash Chronocam’s plucky plan to participate in the automotive sensor market? Maybe. But Luca Verre, CEO and co-founder of Chronocam, remains optimistic. Chronocam CEO Luca Verre A common thread that ties Chronocam with Intel and Mobileye (and by extension, Nvidia, NXP/Qualcomm and others) is that they’re all pursuing the same thing: An autonomous driving machine that can sense, detect and analyze massive data -- almost at real time -- so that a car can instantly respond to any imminent danger. Chronocam is nowhere near the same league as the big boys in the chip industry. But the startup isn’t discouraged. Here’s why.

Intel pursuing new chips as it plots a wearables future Intel is developing a new version of its Curie chip for wearables Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 16 March, 2017 07:41 0 - - - - print email Every year, Intel is present at Fashion Week in New York, showing off how technology will change fashion. It's an odd match, but the depth of technologies shown by Intel has changed every year. In previous years, Intel showed off cool bracelets, smart clothes, and an odd robotic spider dress by Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht. Intel's 2017 showcase was a lot different and more practical, sprinkling in retail technologies with otherworldly wearables. That move to the practical, in a nutshell, describes Intel's tryst with its wearables unit -- from starting as a lab for cool devices to becoming a bootstrapped group focused on practical products amid the company's efforts to reduce wasted spending. Intel believes the best wearable products are yet to come, and it wants to change the way we interact with computing devices, share information, and even entertain ourselves. Intel is developing pursuing chips for wearables like Curie, which will be smaller and faster than the existing chip, and help make sleeker wearables, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. "We have to run just like any other responsible business effort that Intel has," Bautista said. The wearables group started off under the New Devices Group, established in 2013. Intel subsequently acquired companies like Basis to boost its wearables offerings but the unit didn't turn a profit. Amid restructuring, reports emerged last year that Intel had quit wearables. But the effort is still alive and more focused on delivering products that complement Intel's broader focus in areas like servers and the internet of things. Wearables are a pretty small operation at Intel, and it'll keep operating under the radar, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. There are huge untapped markets in wearables, especially in vertical areas like health care. It's hard to say when Intel will find a commercially successful product, but the company will continue developing products, Brookwood said. "It's like Google: You keep throwing things against a wall, something may stick," Brookwood said. Despite a more disciplined approach, the cool products and bright ideas keep coming. Every trade show, Intel dazzles audiences with wearable technologies based on its chips and software. Intel's stage shows have featured Oscar winner A.R. Rahman playing music out of smartwatch-like devices, small shirt buttons that can gather health data, and helmets that can make driving cars and riding bikes safer. Intel has also shown its Project Alloy headset, a mixed-reality headset where objects pop up as floating images in mid-air. It's much like Microsoft's HoloLens -- which also uses Intel chips -- but with faster hardware. Recently, two smartwatches from New Balance's RunIQ and TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 carried Intel software and hardware technologies. An Oakley Pace Radar headset, which runs on Intel software, provides fitness guidance when training. The company's approach to wearables is being replicated in other areas like the Intel Sports Group, which is developing technology so users can watch 3D sports broadcasts as if they were in the stadium. One way to achieve that is by putting more cameras across the field, including helmets worn by players. Using algorithms, Intel servers slice and dice the images from the cameras to provide the customized footage. This will translate well to wearables like VR headsets, as users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Chips like Curie are already instrumental in improving the sports viewing experience from events like last year's Winter X Games. In real time, viewers were able to view key athlete performance data like the height of a snowboarder jump and how far they rotated. The data was captured from the Curie chip and sensors on the snowboards. Data has become extremely valuable, and wearables can help gather more information, especially biometrics. Wearables are edge devices that collect data and feed them to into the large flow of data being sent to cloud servers for analysis, Intel's Bautista said. In some way, one could think of wearables as an extension to Intel's interest in IoT, and it is in some ways similar to other technologies like connected thermostats and consumer sensor devices, Bautista said. Intel cares about how the collected data is analyzed and presented to the user, Bautista said. Wearables will be key for health-care application development, and Insight 64 analyst Brookwood identified galvanized skin response as a big wearable opportunity that Intel could pursue. Wearables also fuel the development of software applications that can be used for analytics, Bautista said. For example, Intel is developing software tools that will bring artificial intelligence to smartwatches like the new Tag Heuer smartwatch with Android Wear 2.0. Intel is taking an open architecture approach to IoT devices and wearables, and a device doesn't have to be tied to x86 chips. When planning the recently released smartwatches, Intel looked at the best chip and software that may fit into a device. Intel has packed the x86 Atom smartphone chips in the recent New Balance and TAG Heuer smartwatches, but it has put ARM processors into other wearables. It remains to be seen how long Intel plays in wearables, Brookwood said. The wearables market will take years to mature, so Intel has to remain in it for the long haul. At the same time, Intel has failed in many of its consumer-facing efforts, especially in media and TV. If Intel technology doesn't power a hit wearable device in the coming years, the effort could be canned. The days of Intel splashing money at efforts that don't produce are gone, Brookwood said. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Sure, SSDs are faster than HDDs, but it seems we’re stuck on those. Two years ago, Intel and Micron said “not anymore”, and the first consumable fruits of that labor has finally landed. Introducing the Intel Optane SSD DC 4800X, the first commercially available “3D XPoint” SSD. Sadly, it’s not something you can buy off shelves, unless you happen to be a well-financed business. There are two types of memory in computing (three actually, but L caches are different beasts). There’s volatile memory, more popularly known as RAM or DRAM in some cases. And then there’s the non-volatile or persistent ones, like HDDs and SDDs. Of the two, volatile memory is fast but expensive to make in large capacities. SSDs may be faster than HDDs, but they still don’t reach the same speeds as DRAM. As you can probably imagine by now, that’s where the Intel Optane SSDs come in. Utilizing the still mysterious 3D XPoint technology, this new breed of SSDs promise the same read/write speeds as DRAM but at capacities near that of your standard data storage. As you can also probably imagine, the Intel Optane SSDs aren’t targeted yet at regular consumers. Its primary beneficiaries are data centers and companies that require high-speed storage and store massive amounts of data. Those usually include activities like artificial intelligence and machine learning, medical records, search engines, and the like. That also means that Intel Optane SSDs aren’t going to be cheap. In fact, the Intel Optane SSD DC 4800X series starts at $1,520, and that’s for only 375 GB of storage. 750 GB and 1 TB SSDs will also be made available soon, for also astronomical prices.

Performance wise, expect it to be an absolute monster - with some new technologies being baked into it from Intel.     Skylake-EX Purley should ship with 6-channel DDR4 support, compared to 4-channel DDR support - with the AVX-512 instruction set, and exciting new 100G OmniPath interconnect technology.     100G OmniPath is a huge deal, as Intel's next-gen 100Gbps networking fabric technology takes things to the next level. We're looking at 100Gbps per port, with 25GB/sec bandwidth (bi-directional), and the Prairie River switch silicon provides switches with teh ability of hitting 48 ports, with up to 9.6TBps of bandwidth (1200GB/sec, or 1.2TB/sec).   There were even engineering samples that reportedly made it online last year, selling for $3845 - quite a steep price, but 64-threaded CPU? Yes, please. The base clock on the higher-end Xeon CPUs is always lower than the consumer-orientated Core family processors, with the monster 32C/64T chip to sport a 2GHz (or so) base clock.   We should see Intel deploy a new socket for these next-gen Xeon parts, with LGA 3467 sure to make an appearance - with support for 12 DDR4 DIMMs... as well as the fresh out of the oven Optane DIMMs, which we've just written about here.   NEWS SOURCES:Tweaktown.com, Anandtech.com Recommended for You Samsung to invest $7 billion in 7nm chips production...

They pointed a beam of X-rays at a piece of an Intel processor and were able to reconstruct the chip’s warren of transistors and wiring in three dimensions. In the future, the team says, this imaging technique could be extended to create high-resolution, large-scale images of the interiors of chips.  The technique is a significant departure from the way the chip industry currently looks inside finished chips, in order to reverse engineer them or check that their own intellectual property hasn’t been misused. Today, reverse engineering outfits progressively remove layers of a processor and take electron microscope images of one small patch of the chip at a time. But “all it takes is a few more years of this kind of work, and you'll pop in your chip and out comes the schematic,” says Anthony Levi of the University of Southern California. “Total transparency in chip manufacturing is on the horizon. This is going to force a rethink of what computing is”, he says, and what it means for a company to add value in the computing industry. Even if this approach isn’t widely adopted to tear down competitors’ chips, it could find a use in other applications. One of those is verifying that a chip only has the features it is intended to have, and that a “hardware Trojan”—added circuitry that could be used for malicious purposes—hasn’t been introduced.  The work, which was published this week in the journal Nature, was conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute’s Swiss Light Source. The facility is a synchrotron; it accelerates electrons around a ring at close to the speed of light in order to generate beams of X-rays. To produce a 3D rendering of the Intel chip—an Intel G3260 processor—the team shined an X-ray beam through a portion of the chip. The various circuit components—its copper wires and silicon transistors, for example—scatter the light in different ways and cause constructive and destructive interference. Through a technique called X-ray ptychography, the researchers could point the beam at their sample from a number of different angles and use the resulting diffraction patterns to reconstruct chip’s internal structure. They began their experiments with a chip they knew the structure of—an ASIC developed at the institute to read out data from a light detector. The team found an excellent match between the chip design and their measurements, and they were able to identify and study the features of a particular circuit inside the chip in fine detail. Image: Mirko Holler A reconstruction of a set-reset latch in the ASIC chip that the team imaged Then they moved on to image circuitry inside the Intel processor, about which they had limited information. The ASIC was produced using 110-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, more than a decade from being cutting edge. But the Intel chip was just a couple of generations behind the state of the art: It was produced using the company’s 22-nm process. (Intel then jumped to 14nm and 10nm is now in the works.) The resolution for this technique in any one direction is 14.6 nm, which rended individual transistor components fairly blurry. The resolution can be improved, but it may be a race to stay close to the smallest features in the chip industry: per Moore’s Law, chip dimensions have gotten smaller since 22nm and continue to do so. This is not the first time that researchers have attempted to use X-rays to image the interior of integrated circuits, says team member Gabriel Aeppli. But “the resolution is better than it’s been in the past. The scale is also larger,” he says. “It’s a huge chunk of the chip compared to what you could do with any other technique.” In this proof-of-concept, the team was using an experimental set-up that was optimized for cylindrical samples, and they had to carve a 10-micrometer-wide pillar out of the chip in order for the imaging process to work. But in the future, the group aims to move toward a different geometry that will allow them to image circuitry without having to damage the chip. Image: Mirko Holler A view of a 10-micrometer-wide pillar carved from the Intel G3260 processor, prior to its extraction. The team expects that changes to the experimental geometry will allow them to image circuitry without cutting into chips. The imaging itself was no small feat. The sample has to remain stable, and interferometers must be used to continuously measure its position. It took about 24 hours to perform the X-ray measurements and the data processing took about as long, says team leader Mirko Holler. But additional computers should easily speed the processing, he says. And improvements to X-ray sources as well as other parts of the experimental apparatus could improve the imaging speed by a factor of 1000. “I don’t see any other probe that could image a full processor without slicing it up,” says Jerry Hastings, a professor at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif. “You need something that simultaneously gives you the resolution and the penetrating power. And that’s where X-rays are unique.” “What they’ve done is a proof of concept and it’s quite impressive at that level”, says Dick James, an emeritus fellow at TechInsights, which strips chips down to the transistor level to examine how the devices are built and wired together.  James says there are practical limitations to the amount of circuitry that can be analyzed using those traditional tear-down techniques, which, depending on the packaging, can start with a bath in boiling sulphuric acid. But he notes a lot can be gleaned by piecing together small electron microscope pictures of the chip: “You can get most of the cell library by looking at smaller areas.”  And even with a perfect image of an entire chip, there will be some things you can’t know about how the chip was made. “So many steps are sacrificial,” James says. “Unless there’s some sort of residue or fingerprint left by a process, you can’t actually see what’s been done. You just have to infer it from the structures that are left behind.” Although X-ray ptychography does promise bigger, high-resolution views, it faces several obstacles, James says. For one, chip feature sizes at the cutting edge could prove a challenge for its resolution. “The industry is getting ahead of this technique already,” he says. Another impediment is the need for a synchrotron source. These aren’t likely to find their way into chipmaking fabs, although there are a number of such facilities around the world and it is possible to rent time on them. Because of these limitations, James says, the best application for this imaging technique could be on chips that are made with older manufacturing processes, and thus have larger features. This is the case for a number of chips used in military and space applications. “If you can look at the whole chip, then you can compare the chip with the original design,” James says, and “do a direct comparison [to] see if there are any obvious faults or any extra circuitry that’s been put in.” Learn More Intel X-ray imaging X-ray ptychography chip inspection integrated circuits intellectual property ptychography reverse-engineering tomography trade secrets Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Nanoclast IEEE Spectrum’s nanotechnology blog, featuring news and analysis about the development, applications, and future of science and technology at the nanoscale.

Of the Intel, Toshiba, and Samsung NVMe solid-state drives he has tested so far, he comes out recommending Samsung SSDs for performance, value, and safety. Matthew Dillon commented, "The Intel 600P is a piece of junk (never buy one), and while the Toshiba did very well in performance tests it also got rather hot, topping out at 81C, and didn't flag the over-heat or auto-throttle insofar as I can tell. The Intel actually did auto-throttle. Neither Samsung over-temp'd. The 960 EVO stayed very cool, in fact." You can read his thoughts on different NVMe SSDs under DragonFlyBSD via this mailing list post that's backed up by a lot of additional technical results. He seems to have much better luck than I did with the Samsung 960 EVO, which ended up dieing after a few days of use last year, but haven't been able to RMA yet since the Samsung SSD RMA web form was broken at last check... 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

MSI Z270 MPower Gaming Titanium doubles down on metal by Eric Born  10:00 AM on March 17, 2017 MSI hasn't left prospective Z270 gamers starving for options. After launching an opening salvo of models equipped with the latest chipsets from Intel, MSI has now released another motherboard for gamers looking to overclock a high-performance Core processor: the Z270 MPower Gaming Titanium. The board's Titanium branding doesn't just refer to the the silver metallic PCB, heatsinks, and covers. A board-wide backplate and three steel-reinforced PCIe x16 slots all help to ensure that heavy CPU coolers and graphics cards don't bend the PCB. The four memory slots have similar physical protection and come with fully-isolated memory circuits, earning the MPower Titanium a rating for memory up to DDR4-4000. MSI claims that it's even tested stable speeds beyond that mark, too. There's also SLI and Crossfire support on tap for those with a need for extra pixel-pushing power. The board has a total of three M.2 slots and a U.2 connector, all supporting NVMe SSDs and Intel's Optane Memory. One of them comes with a heat shield that latches down on top of an SSD and might help reduce thermal throttling. MSI also makes a play to appeal to audiophiles. There are dual Realtek ALC1220 audio codecs, each with its own amplifier—one for the rear-panel ports and another one for the front panel connectors. MSI claims that its electrically-isolated audio PCB traces help improve sound quality. Since setting up USB ports for a virtual-reality setup apparently takes some planning, MSI includes a USB 3.0 port on the back panel that it says has been optimized for VR. The company claims that a chip aboard the MPower Titanium ensures that this USB port has a clean and strong signal. The board offers plenty of USB ports all told: two USB 2.0 connectors, three USB 3.0 ports, one USB 3.1 Type-A connectors, and two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. Network connectivity comes by way of a Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet adapter. Other niceties include an external clock generator for BLCK tuning, voltage measurement points, onboard diagnostic LEDs and buttons, of course, RGB LED lighting. MSI says the Z270 MPower Titanium should be available right away, but we haven't spotted one for sale at online retailers yet. However, B&H Photo Video will let interested buyers preorder one for $330. Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies.

Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM.

Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 17:33 MajorLag says: Yeah, that makes sense given their reputation as “basically a mediocre PC”.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Twitter Facebook Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD The Optane DC P4800X SSD has 375GB of storage and is priced at $1,520 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 20 March, 2017 03:00 - - - - print email Comments Intel's first Optane storage modules came out in early January, but were only 32GB. Larger Optane drives with up to 1.5TB of storage capacity are on their way, and we now have a better understanding of how they're going to perform. The first large-capacity Optane SSD drive is the DC P4800X, which has 375GB of storage and started shipping on Sunday. The $1,520 SSD is targeted at servers. (Intel didn't provide regional availability information.) Intel says an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB will ship in the second quarter, and that a 1.5TB SSD will ship in the second half of this year. These SSDs will fit as add-in cards in the PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. That means they could work in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Optane will also ship in the form of DRAM modules next year. Intel did not share information on when it would ship consumer SSDs.Â  Optane has been hyped as a new class of superfast memory and storage that could replace today's SSDs and DRAM. Intel has claimed Optane is up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. The technology underpinning Optane is 3D Xpoint, a form of memory that stores data based on the resistance of cells. Intel developed 3D Xpoint with Micron, which later this year will release an Optane competitor called QuantX, aimed at enterprise SSDs. For the first time, Intel has shared internal benchmarks on the large-capacity Optane drives compared to conventional flash SSDs. TheÂ Optane SSD DC P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD DC P3700 flash SSD, which is considered one of Intel's fastest data-center SSDs in terms of random reads and writes. The benchmarks indicate that the new Optane drive, in most real-world uses, won't reach the levels of performance that Intel has been hyping up to now. On top of that, the benchmarks were conducted in complex environments that made the numbers hard to interpret. In a nutshell, Intel said that if you run sequential tasks, it would be better to use conventional SSDs. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes reach up to 10 times faster compared to conventional SSDs, but only when utilization is being pushed to extremes, while reads are around three times faster. In a standard 4K data block, with 70 percent read and 30 percent write, the P4800X was five to eight times faster than the older P3700. The responsiveness of the drive increased with the data load. Aside from the unusual benchmarking presentation by Intel, Optane has promise, and it could be the storage technology of the future. However, flash-based SSDs are well-established and Optane won't unseat them overnight, according to analysts. Optane is more expensive and still being developed, and joins the ranks of other technologies like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM) and RRAM (resistive RAM) trying to unseat flash. Intel took a long time to develop large-capacity Optane SSDs, and there is some concern about the drive's durability. The P4800X has a five-year warranty, but it remains to be seen how long the drive will last. Optane SSDs will speed up data movement among servers in data centers, said James Myers, director for NVM Solutions Architecture at Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Storage is a big bottleneck, and the Optane SSDs will reduce latency. That will improve the productivity of servers, and will help in applications like analytics, which deal with large data sets. Optane could be used for for caching or long-term or short-term storage. Optane SSDs could also be used to expand memory capacity in servers by mimicking DRAM with the help of a hypervisor, Myers said. To make this happen, Intel will sell software called Memory Drive for Optane drives. This feature will only work on servers with Intel's upcoming Xeon chips based on the Skylake architecture, and won't work with AMD chips. Applications that will benefit from Optane include MySQL and Memcached, which are popular with cloud providers. Data movement in servers run by companies like Facebook and Google is fast to ensure instant responses to social media or search requests. Intel's Myers also saw the storage fitting into hyperconverged environments, in which Optane is closer to the CPU, or in an array. Optane isn't a particularly good fit for typical networked storage arrays like EMC's EqualLogic, which are extremely popular, but Myers is pinning hopes on companies moving to hyperconverged infrastructures. Intel estimated that two servers with P4800X drives could provide 10 times more MySQL transactions than with P3700 SSDs. It would also result in a 91 percent reduction in cost per transaction. But there's a heavy cost involved in changing the data-center infrastructure to fit the superfast Optane drives. In the long run, the Optane drives may be beneficial in speeding up database, cloud and machine-learning applications, but switching over to a hyperconverged environment could call for wholesale changes in server hardware, virtualization environment, and organization of storage in data centers. Also, Optane SSDs don't play well in in-memory applications like SAP HANA. In theory, the Memory Drive feature could be used so the Optane SSDs mimic DRAM, which can ultimately be used by in-memory applications. Intel is in talks with major in-memory application providers to build usage of Optane SSDs, Myers said. Companies are increasingly backing Optane, Myers said. Facebook has been trying out Optane for more than a year, but hasn't reported results. IBM has incorporated Optane storage in its Bluemix cloud service, but hasn't talked about benchmarks. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to offer Optane SSDs as a media option in 3PAR arrays. The current latency for all-flash arrays is about 400 microseconds to 1 millisecond, and with 3D Xpoint/Optane it will come down to 200 microseconds, said HPE's Eduardo Duarte, 3Par product manager, in a video at the Discover trade show in London in December. Optane compatibility will also be validated for VMware's vSAN virtualized storage environments. Alibaba also has committed to using Optane in its database and machine-learning infrastructure, Myers said. Intel is also talking with Microsoft to validate Optane for Windows Server storage environments. In addition, a range of companies including Lenovo, Nutanix and Dell Technologies have confirmed that they will come out with hardware based on Optane. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

While the exact nomenclature of the chip is not known, it appears to be a Skylake-EP Xeon part that was sent to the Google Compute Engine team for initial prototyping. This is consistent with the news we have been hearing about Google Compute Engine now offering extended core counts to clients of their service. Intel’s massive Skylake Purley flagship, the Xeon E5 2699 v5, spotted in Geekbench database The chip manages to score an outstanding 49,647 points for all-core score and 3526 points on the single core score. Usually these Xeon chips don’t fare as well in the single core department but this particular CPU is something special and for good measure as well (as you will read later in the article). This score is probably one of the highest all-core scores (if not the highest) on Geekbench for a single socket, single package CPU and showcase very impressive performance numbers. Before we go on any further here are the screenshots of the benchmark score itself: Related Intel’s ‘Skylake Purley’ Family of Microprocessors Will Boast upto 28 Cores and 56 Threads – Next Generation Xeon Platform Landing in 2016 The leak only states that the tested CPU houses 32 cores (eliminating a 2S benchmark) which makes it one of the hugest dies we have seen from Intel. What is so mysterious about this particular chip is that the documentation of the Skylake Purley platform we have states that it maxes out at 28 cores/56 threads. This leak however, aims to challenge that statement since the Family 6 Model 63 designation puts it solidly in the Xeon family and the only place where such a processor could fit in is the Xeon E5-2699 flagship. Since this is a Skylake part it will have the “V5” suffix as well, for a full branding of Xeon E5 2699 v5. That said, even though the documentation maxes out at 28 cores/56 threads, we have previously spotted the processor on a Chinese forum and it is very much real. This processor has a base clock of 2.10 GHz and it has a pretty PCB since it’s designed for the latest LGA 3647 socket. The more interesting thing about this processor is its core count which shatters everything that Intel has done before. Advertisement In fact, one of the reasons Intel has increased the flagship core count is because AMD will be rolling out its Naples chip very soon and it will be boasting 32 cores under one CPU package as well. Since 2S and 4S designs usually have additional complications involved, a maximum number of cores under one CPU package is always desirable. Intel announced general availability of Skylake-EP chips in mid 2017 and we expect a launch around Computex 2017. Intel has made several HPC focused optimizations in Skylake-EP chips, some of which include Advanced Vector Instructions-512 to boost floating point calculations and encryption algorithms. Related Massive Intel Xeon E5 and Xeon E7 Leak – Skylake Purley to be the Biggest Advancement Since Nehalem Some more details of the Skylake Purley platform The Skylake Purley platform will be divided between three major categories 2S, 4S and 8S/8S+. This includes the family range from Xeon E5 to Xeon E7. The expected nomenclature should assume the ‘v5’ suffix thanks to the Skylake microarchitecture present in the processors and include the lineups of Xeon E5 2600 v5, Xeon E5 4600 v5, Xeon E7 4800 v5 and Xeon E7 8800 v5. The E5 family includes the dual socket and quad socket designs (2S and 4S) whileas the E7 family includes the 8 socket design structure with the C602 chipset and a scalable memory buffer. One of the biggest advancements that Skylake will have is the Intel Omnipath Architecture integration which will be called Storm Lake (Generation 1). The PCH will be codenamed Lewisburg while as it will also ship with updated Ethernet controllers. Another very important point to note is that the platform will be scalable up to 8 Sockets – which is frankly an absolutely insane amount for CPUs working in tandem in any given configuration. Specific SKUs have not been disclosed at this time. Since we already have in our possession the complete slide deck of this platform, I have taken the liberty to post the important bits here: Skylake EX Purley will be spread out amongst the entire scalable segment – unlike the previous iterations. The TDP will be configurable from 45W to 165W and will require Socket P. Another interesting point to note is the fact that not only will Purley update the number of PCIe slots to 48 but they will finally be configurable in x4, x8 and x16 divisions ( a major update). Previous reports had hinted on Intel working on some secret project that will prove Skylake to be quite a big architectural jump and not simply another Harwell. While we haven’t seen any evidence of this revolutionary change on the mainstream side – Skylake Purley does appear to be the aforementioned jump, incarnate. According to Intel’s own slides, Skylake Purley is poised to be the biggest update since the age old Nehalem platform. Along with the improved performance per watt that comes with every article iteration, Skylake EX Purley will actually ship with 6 Channels of DDR4 as opposed to 4. It will also include the AVX 512 instruction set and will boast the 100G OmniPath interconnect. Skylake Purley will also have Cannonlake graphics support not to mention FPGA integration (another important upgrade). The new platform also comes with an updated socket. The socket has been upgraded to feature 3647 pins that gives it the LGA 3647 name. The socket is surrounded by 12 DDR4 DIMM slots. This is due to support for next-generation hexa-channel memory and Intel’s Optane DIMMs for faster latency solutions. Overall, Purley will be expanding Intel’s server platform with a range of new features.

AMD’s new line-up of chipsets are positioned as high-performance chips for PCs Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar One of highlights of the new chipsets is the AI-powered Sense MI technology, which allows the chips to customise its performance based on how the user interacts with apps or games. After playing second fiddle to Intel in the PC segment for many years, AMD has decided to enter the high-end gaming segment with the new Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 series of processors. AMD’s chips are usually found in budget laptops while Intel dominates the high-end PC segment. Ryzen 7 series chips are now available for PC makers as well, which means we can see laptops and desktops based on them in the next couple of months. Ryzen 7 1800x is the most powerful of the lot with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and boost clock speed of 4.0GHz. It is priced at $499 (around Rs32,716). The Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700 have lower clock speeds and are priced at $399 (around Rs26,160) and $349 (around Rs22,887), respectively. There is no update on the Ryzen 3 series yet, but the Ryzen 5 series processor will be available in the market from next month. According to some reports, Microsoft will no longer support the older version of Windows such as Windows 7 and 8 on new Intel and AMD processor, including the Ryzen family chipsets. Users can still run older versions of Windows, but they will not receive any security or other updates from Microsoft. What the new line-up offers At the top of the Ryzen hierarchy sits the Ryzen 7 series which includes Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 chips. All three are octa-core chips and are based on AMD’s new 14nm Zen architecture which is more energy efficient than the 28nm based Bulldozer architecture used in earlier AMD chips. The new chipsets also support simultaneous multi-threading (equivalent to Intel’s Hyper threading technology) which means each core can run more than one thread at a time. The cache system has also been redesigned to allow faster access to data. For users looking for more affordable options, AMD has Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 line-up of processors. The Ryzen 5 series includes four different models. The Ryzen 5 1600X and Ryzen 5 1600 are the superior hexa-core chips sets with boost clock speed of up to 4.0GHz. The Ryzen 5 1500 and Ryzen 5 1400 are the quad-core variants with boost clock speed of up to 3.4GHz. Artificial intelligence One of highlights of the new chipsets is the AI-powered Sense MI technology, which allows the chips to customise its performance based on how the user interacts with apps or games. It uses neural networks and software algorithms which can predict how apps and games will run based on earlier runs and monitor user and app requirements to optimise clock speeds. Lower power needs Due to the smaller architecture and improved cooling system, the Ryzen chipsets have also got a lower TDP (thermal design power), which stands for maximum power consumption. The Ryzen 7 1800X and Ryzen 7 1700x have a TDP of 95W. Ryzen 7 1700 has a TDP of 65W. What it means for users For years, AMD has been providing a more cost-effective alternative to Intel’s chips for laptops and desktop PCs. But none of its earlier products were powerful enough to compete with Intel’s top-of-the-line chipsets. The Ryzen line-up changes that, and brings in some much-needed competition. What users will have to brace up for is that AMD chips will cost more than some of Intel‘s 7th gen chipsets. For example, the Ryzen 7 1800x costs $499, while Intel’s 7th gen i7 processor costs $350 (approximately Rs22,947). This means, the new AMD-powered PCs will cost as much as the high-end Intel 7th Gen based PCs.

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is an enterprise PCIe 3 x4 NVMe SSD that Intel promises will be the the most responsive data center SSD with lower latency than all of the fastest NAND flash based competitors. After months of touting 3D XPoint memory primarily with rough order of magnitude claims about its performance, endurance and cost relative to DRAM and NAND flash, and after some unexplained delays, Intel is finally providing some concrete specifications and pricing for a complete SSD that is shipping today. The information is more limited than we're accustomed to for their NAND flash SSDs, and Intel still isn't confirming anything about the materials or exact operating principle of the 3D XPoint memory cell. Current computer system architectures are based around the use of DRAM as working memory and NAND flash for fast storage. 3D XPoint memory falls between the two technologies on most important metrics, so Optane SSDs bring a new dimension of complication to a server architect's task. For most enterprise use cases, the most enticing feature of Optane SSDs over NAND SSDs is the former's higher performance, especially reduced latencies. Aside from the gains from switching to the NVMe protocol, the latency offered by NAND flash based SSDs has been mostly stagnant or even regressed with the disappearance of SLC NAND from the market, even as throughput and capacity have grown with every generation. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for a typical read or write latency under 10µs, compared to tens of microseconds for the best NAND flash based SSDs, and about 4µs minimum imposed by PCIe and NVMe transaction overhead. More impressive is how little latency degrades under less than ideal conditions. Queue depth 1 random reads are rated to remain below 30µs even while the drive is simultaneously accepting 2GB/s of sustained random writes (about 500k IOPS). Intel even specifies Quality of Service (QoS) standards for latency at the 99.999th percentile, with even QD16 random writes staying almost entirely below 200µs. A consequence of the low latency is that the P4800X can deliver full throughput at lower queue depths: the P4800X is rated to deliver maximum IOPS at QD16 while flash-based SSDs are specified for queue depths of at least 32. Unlike flash memory, the read and write performance of 3D XPoint memory is roughly equal, and this is reflected in Intel's specifications for the P4800X. Conspicuously missing from the performance specifications are sequential throughput. The P4800X can already use more than half of the available PCIe bandwidth with a completely random I/O workload. Rather than reassure us that the P4800X can do even better with larger transfer sizes, Intel suggests that being overly concerned with the sequential transfer speeds is a sign that you should be shopping for their 3D NAND SSDs instead. They'll offer plenty of throughput for a far lower price. Intel's 3D XPoint memory is being manufactured as a 128Gb (16GB) die, slightly behind the trend for NAND flash capacities. As a result, the Optane SSD DC P4800X will start with a 375GB model and later this year be followed by 750GB and 1.5TB models. The top-performing enterprise SSDs currently tend to be multi-TB drives. Intel has shared very few details about the new controller they've developed for the P4800X, but they have disclosed that the 375GB model uses seven channels with four dies per channel, for a total of 28 chips and a raw capacity of 448GB. Fourteen packages of 3D XPoint memory are visible on the back side of the drive in the photographs Intel has released, suggesting that fourteen more packages are hiding under the heatsink and that the 375GB add-in card model is using single-die packages. The controller implements a high-performance all-hardware read path that does not involve the drive's firmware, and while the exact stride of memory accesses is not known, a single 4k read will be spread across all seven channels. 3D XPoint memory can be read or written with byte granularity and modifications can be written in place, so it is free from the worst internal fragmentation and write amplification challenges that are caused by the large page sizes and huge erase block sizes of NAND flash. This means that further overprovisioning beyond the drive's native amount will have minimal impact on performance and that the performance of a full drive should not suffer severely the way flash based SSDs do. However, some amount of spare area is still required for error correction and other metadata and for a pool of spare blocks to replace failed or defective blocks. The write endurance of 3D XPoint memory is not infinite so wear leveling is still required, but it is a much simpler process that requires much less spare area. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X has a write endurance rating of 30 Drive Writes Per Day, and Intel is hopeful that future products can offer even higher ratings once 3D XPoint memory has more broadly proven its reliability. Today's limited release 375GB models have a three year warranty for a total write endurance rating of 12.3 PB, and once the product line is expanded to broad availability of the full range of capacities in the second half of this year the warranty period will be five years. Intel is offering the 375GB P4800X in PCIe add-in card form factor with a MSRP of $1520 starting today with a limited early-ship program. In Q2 a 375GB U.2 model will ship, as well as a 750GB add-in card. In the second half of the year the rest of the capacity and form factor options will be available, but prices and exact release dates for those models have not been announced. At just over $4/GB the P4800X seems to fall much closer to DRAM than NAND in price, though to be fair the enterprise SSDs it will compete against are all well over $1/GB and the largest DDR4 DIMMs are around $10/GB.

The Memory Drive Technology software is a custom virtual memory system implemented as a minimal hypervisor. The guest operating system or general-purpose hypervisor is presented with the illusion that a portion of the 3D XPoint memory on the Optane SSD is directly addressable, producing an apparent memory capacity that far exceeds the capacity of the system's installed DRAM. Under the hood and almost entirely transparent to the guest OS, Intel Memory Drive Technology monitors memory access patterns to cache actively used data in DRAM and prefetch from Optane SSDs. At a high level, this is merely duplicating the paging mechanisms all operating systems already provide. However, Intel claims that the heuristics used by Memory Drive Technology can far outperform those currently used by operating systems to manage swap space residing on storage that is far slower than Optane SSDs. On some workloads Intel Memory Drive Technology can offer performance approaching that of an all-DRAM memory pool of equal capacity, though this will depend highly on the specific application workload. Intel Memory Drive Technology has a substantial capacity overhead: a 375GB Optane SSD can provide up to 320GB of virtual memory. Multiple Optane SSDs can be used to provide virtual memory up to ten times the system's DRAM capacity, though Intel recommends Optane to DRAM ratios between 3:1 and 8:1. When multiple CPUs or Optane SSDs are in use, the Memory Drive Technology software will take into account non-uniform memory access (NUMA) effects and attempt to optimize data placement to put data in the DRAM or Optane SSD that is closest to the core using it. By default, the Memory Drive Technology software will present to the guest OS a NUMA topology equivalent to the underlying DRAM configuration plus a pool of memory that is not local to any of the processors, with capacity equal to the virtual memory provided by the Optane SSDs. However, this is implemented purely for the sake of allowing NUMA-aware software to adapt its usage patterns; regardless of the NUMA configuration seen by the guest software, the Memory Drive Technology software will not be statically allocating specific address ranges to DRAM or Optane storage. The approach taken by the Memory Drive Technology software allows operating systems and applications to function without modification and without requiring Optane-specific optimizations, but it also means there is no way for applications that are NUMA-aware or use system calls like madvise to communicate directly with the real memory allocator. The full licensing cost structure for Intel Memory Drive Technology is not clear, but the MSRP for a 375GB P4800X bundled with Memory Drive Technology is $1951 compared to $1520 for the SSD alone. The Memory Drive Technology hypervisor must be booted from a USB device or an IDE-compatible storage controller, and the guest operating system cannot be booted in UEFI mode. Intel Xeon E5-x6xx v2 or later and E7- x8xx v2 or later processors are supported. Future 3D XPoint-based Optane products on Intel's roadmap include Optane Memory cache drives for the client/consumer segment, due in Q2 of this year. They will also be followed by larger Optane SSDs for the client market. DIMMs featuring 3D XPoint memory are planned for 2018.

A huge downgrade from their initial presentation Reply Billy Tallis - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link I think the problem is mainly that Intel didn't do enough to emphasize the difference between the performance of the memory cell itself versus the performance achievable from an entire drive with a controller and with protocol overhead. The PCIe bus doesn't really allow for a 1000x improvement in latency over existing NVMe SSDs. We'll have to wait for the 3D XPoint DIMMs before we can conclusively declare that they've missed that performance goal. It does look like the endurance is falling well short of their projections, but the density has pretty much hit the target. Reply eSyr - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link > PCIe bus doesn't really allow for a 1000x improvement in latency over existing NVMe SSDs Bullshit. PCIe 3.0 has a round-trip latency less than 300 ns and sustained bandwidth more than 11 GB/s for 64-bit reads and more than 15 GB/s for 4K reads, it's more than sustained bandwidth of single DDR4 channel. Reply IntelUser2000 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link Yes, the hardware latency might be low, but it's the software part that slows it down. Even Intel's own presentations show this. https://www.google.ca/search?q=3d+xpoint&clien... Besides, if there truly was no difference between having it on a DIMM format and PCI Express, why not simplify things and put DDR4 on PCI Express as well? Reply ddriver - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link PCIE is really serial bulk transfer, whereas RAM is... well, Random Access. Plus the additional interface overhead, rather than having the MC directly connected to the CPU it will have to go through the PCIE protocol too. Plus eating up from the CPUs IO bandwidth to the point of starving the rest of the system. It will likely be faster in DIMM mode, not but that much because it avoids the bottleneck of PCIE per se, but because of the increased parallelism and the direct connection to the CPU via the MC. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link All I want is long term storage Give me a 20TB external X-Point backup drive with a write protect switch and enough onboard RAM to handle temporary writes while in READ ONLY mode ....and I want it for less than $200 Otherwise, just give me a PCIe 4.0 X 16 X-Point Drive for gaming with 30GB/sec load speeds for the same price Using this for persistent RAM makes no sense to me persistent malware will be there forever Latencies should improve "somewhat" over Flash based SSD's for gaming (regardless of interface) but I'm looking for better load times and LONG TERM storage! AT A MUCHHHHH LOWER PRICE! Reply kawmic - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I'm with you man! Way too expensive. Reply Samus - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link Serial memory interfaces have come and gone (Rambus) but HBM is serial. The bus is just ultra wide to make up for it. However, latency is definitely slower and that needs to be compensated for by the memory controller (currently, GPU's) I think Intel's approach here won't be limited by PCIe. Not in the least. Current Xpoint is turning out to be pretty low performance from what we were all (I think) speculating. It turns out it's benefits are durability (30 DWPD!) and low latency due to a simplified indirection table to read/write architecture that writes to cells not pages. This is very cool, but is simply out of the realm of most platforms. Even PCIe SSD's are overkill for most applications because unless you are hosting a database, or manipulating large files (large random IO) a SATA3 SSD already performs well enough to host an OS and applications. After all the entire Windows 10 OS can be transferred over SATA3 in 6 seconds, and you only need to read about 1GB into memory to complete a boot to login. Most large game maps are 2-3GB total (textures to load into VRAM) and they can only be done 3-5 seconds faster by the fastest mainstream NVMe drive over the fastest mainstream SATA3 drive (1800MB/sec vs 560MB/sec) That's the most reasonable scenario a desktop user is going to notice a large enough difference to justify the cost of NVMe. This will change in the future as programs get larger but the cost to NVMe still isn't justifyable for the majority of applications. Reply TelstarTOS - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link "pretty low performance" has to be seen yet. If the numbers at QD1 and QD2 are about half those announced at QD16 it will be awesome in a real world scenario. Reply beginner99 - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link Exactly. Especially also for a client PC. First time in a long time one will actually be able to see a difference between SSDs. But yeah, obviously not worth the price yet. The real deal for consumers as far as we know will be 32-64 GB cache drives. But looks like that software needs some serious work for this to happens as UEFI for sure is a must on consumer devices.

Single page Print Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X opens new frontiers in datacenter storage 3D Xpoint bridges DRAM and NAND by Jeff Kampman  11:00 AM on March 19, 2017 Intel's high-performance 3D Xpoint (say crosspoint) memory technology promised far-reaching changes for storage, memory, and computer architecture when the company first took the wraps off the technology in mid-2015. Of course, big promises begot high expectations, and despite a hunger for more information, we've heard relatively little about how 3D Xpoint will perform in the intervening time. That all changes today. 3D Xpoint will power Intel's first Optane device, the SSD DC P4800X, and that device demonstrates the wide-ranging potential of Optane to change how we think about the balance between memory and storage in a system. Optane from the ground up The SSD DC P4800X launching today packs 375GB of 3D Xpoint storage on a PCIe add-in card form factor. Intel is keeping the physical details of its Xpoint media under wraps, but we do know some of the basics of the stuff now. The first Xpoint dies are being fabricated on a 20-nanometer process and can hold 128 Gbits each. Intel says that because the Xpoint medium itself relies on low-resistance and low-capacitance interconnects in the back end of the device, it can switch a thousand times faster than NAND. Consequently, Xpoint delivers much lower access times and much higher performance. 3D Xpoint also offers much finer access granularity than NAND. Instead of working on pages with many kilobytes of data as NAND does, Intel says the structure of the Xpoint device allows for bit-level access. Practically, that means Xpoint can work with words of data, so it's a natural fit for delivering cache lines like DRAM does. Even though it's not as fast as DRAM, Xpoint can be manufactured with 10 times the density of that memory, giving it NAND-class capacity. Intel also says that chip-for-chip, Xpoint is a thousand times more durable compared to 3D NAND. Of course, Xpoint is non-volatile like NAND, as well. Xpoint is just one piece of the puzzle for Optane products, however. Intel has developed a custom controller to take advantage of the unique properties of the Xpoint material. For the DC P4800X, the controller talks over PCI Express using the NVMe protocol. Like an SSD controller, Optane products use multiple channels with multiple dies per channel to exploit parallelism for greater performance. However, Optane's controller ASIC handles both data and commands exclusively in hardware to deliver the full performance of Xpoint media (at least the performance possible on the PCI Express 3.0 bus). The Optane controller can also spread a 4KB read operation over all of its dies, which Intel contrasts with the single-die read handling of NAND. Thanks to Xpoint's fine-grained access characteristics, Optane devices can also write in place on the underlying medium, unlike NAND's read-modify-write cycle at the block level. In turn, Xpoint should match its higher performance with high endurance. With a drive as fast as the P4800X, Intel believes that up to 30 drive writes per day is going to be adequate endurance for the types of applications it believes will benefit from Xpoint's performance. With a rated maximum of 12.3 petabytes written, that means the 375GB DC P4800X drive could endure 30 DWPD for three years of constant use by our calculations. It's worth noting that the projected endurance figures in the graphs above come from the 750GB P4800X, not the 375GB drive. Larger drives should enjoy a greater total petabytes written figure if Xpoint endurance scaling is similar to that of NAND. The best-case NAND endurance figure, on the other hand, comes from Intel's DC P3700 800GB and its 14.6 PBW figure, good for 10 DWPD. The 375GB P4800X uses a seven-channel controller with four dies of 3D Xpoint per channel for 28 dies total. Although Xpoint devices don't require overprovisioning like NAND SSDs, the P4800X still reserves some extra space for ECC, firmware, and reallocation of bad regions of its total storage pool.

Larger Optane drives with up to 1.5TB of storage capacity are on their way, and we now have a better understanding of how they're going to perform. The first large-capacity Optane SSD drive is the DC P4800X, which has 375GB of storage and started shipping on Sunday. The $1,520 SSD is targeted at servers. (Intel didn't provide regional availability information.) Intel says an enterprise Optane SSD with 750GB will ship in the second quarter, and that a 1.5TB SSD will ship in the second half of this year. These SSDs will fit as add-in cards in the PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. That means they could work in some workstations and servers based on AMD's 32-core Naples processors. Optane will also ship in the form of DRAM modules next year. Intel did not share information on when it would ship consumer SSDs.Â  Optane has been hyped as a new class of superfast memory and storage that could replace today's SSDs and DRAM. Intel has claimed Optane is up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. The technology underpinning Optane is 3D Xpoint, a form of memory that stores data based on the resistance of cells. Intel developed 3D Xpoint with Micron, which later this year will release an Optane competitor called QuantX, aimed at enterprise SSDs. For the first time, Intel has shared internal benchmarks on the large-capacity Optane drives compared to conventional flash SSDs. TheÂ Optane SSD DC P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD DC P3700 flash SSD, which is considered one of Intel's fastest data-center SSDs in terms of random reads and writes. The benchmarks indicate that the new Optane drive, in most real-world uses, won't reach the levels of performance that Intel has been hyping up to now. On top of that, the benchmarks were conducted in complex environments that made the numbers hard to interpret. In a nutshell, Intel said that if you run sequential tasks, it would be better to use conventional SSDs. Optane lights up when running random reads and writes, which are common in servers and high-end PCs. Optane's random writes reach up to 10 times faster compared to conventional SSDs, but only when utilization is being pushed to extremes, while reads are around three times faster. In a standard 4K data block, with 70 percent read and 30 percent write, the P4800X was five to eight times faster than the older P3700. The responsiveness of the drive increased with the data load. Aside from the unusual benchmarking presentation by Intel, Optane has promise, and it could be the storage technology of the future. However, flash-based SSDs are well-established and Optane won't unseat them overnight, according to analysts. Optane is more expensive and still being developed, and joins the ranks of other technologies like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM) and RRAM (resistive RAM) trying to unseat flash. Intel took a long time to develop large-capacity Optane SSDs, and there is some concern about the drive's durability. The P4800X has a five-year warranty, but it remains to be seen how long the drive will last. Optane SSDs will speed up data movement among servers in data centers, said James Myers, director for NVM Solutions Architecture at Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Storage is a big bottleneck, and the Optane SSDs will reduce latency. That will improve the productivity of servers, and will help in applications like analytics, which deal with large data sets. Optane could be used for for caching or long-term or short-term storage. Optane SSDs could also be used to expand memory capacity in servers by mimicking DRAM with the help of a hypervisor, Myers said. To make this happen, Intel will sell software called Memory Drive for Optane drives. This feature will only work on servers with Intel's upcoming Xeon chips based on the Skylake architecture, and won't work with AMD chips. Applications that will benefit from Optane include MySQL and Memcached, which are popular with cloud providers. Data movement in servers run by companies like Facebook and Google is fast to ensure instant responses to social media or search requests. Intel's Myers also saw the storage fitting into hyperconverged environments, in which Optane is closer to the CPU, or in an array. Optane isn't a particularly good fit for typical networked storage arrays like EMC's EqualLogic, which are extremely popular, but Myers is pinning hopes on companies moving to hyperconverged infrastructures. Intel estimated that two servers with P4800X drives could provide 10 times more MySQL transactions than with P3700 SSDs. It would also result in a 91 percent reduction in cost per transaction. But there's a heavy cost involved in changing the data-center infrastructure to fit the superfast Optane drives. In the long run, the Optane drives may be beneficial in speeding up database, cloud and machine-learning applications, but switching over to a hyperconverged environment could call for wholesale changes in server hardware, virtualization environment, and organization of storage in data centers. Also, Optane SSDs don't play well in in-memory applications like SAP HANA. In theory, the Memory Drive feature could be used so the Optane SSDs mimic DRAM, which can ultimately be used by in-memory applications. Intel is in talks with major in-memory application providers to build usage of Optane SSDs, Myers said. Companies are increasingly backing Optane, Myers said. Facebook has been trying out Optane for more than a year, but hasn't reported results. IBM has incorporated Optane storage in its Bluemix cloud service, but hasn't talked about benchmarks. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is going to offer Optane SSDs as a media option in 3PAR arrays. The current latency for all-flash arrays is about 400 microseconds to 1 millisecond, and with 3D Xpoint/Optane it will come down to 200 microseconds, said HPE's Eduardo Duarte, 3Par product manager, in a video at the Discover trade show in London in December. Optane compatibility will also be validated for VMware's vSAN virtualized storage environments. Alibaba also has committed to using Optane in its database and machine-learning infrastructure, Myers said. Intel is also talking with Microsoft to validate Optane for Windows Server storage environments. In addition, a range of companies including Lenovo, Nutanix and Dell Technologies have confirmed that they will come out with hardware based on Optane. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X will be offered in both PCIe add-in-board and U.2 form factors, but for our article today we’ll be showing just the PCIe version. Intel is very conservative when it comes to making bold claims, but they are calling this the ‘World’s Most Responsive Data Center SSD.’ The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is a low-latency drive with responsiveness all the time thanks to high-performance at low-queue depths. Intel believes that this drive will fit the bill when it comes to fast storage and caching as well as extending memory for larger data sets to be used in the workplace. Let’s take a quick look at some of the key specifications of the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. FEATURE SPECIFICATION Capacity 375GB Form Factor Add-in-Card (AIC); Half-height, Half-length, Low-profile Interface PCIe 3.0 x4, NVMe Latency (typical) R/W <10μs  Quality of Service (QoS): 99.999%  4kB5 Random Queue Depth 1, R/W: <60/100 μs 4kB Random Queue Depth 16, R/W: <150/200 μs  Throughput  IOPS Random 4kB R/W: Up to 550/500k IOPS Random 4kB 70/30 Mixed R/W: Up to 500k  Endurance  30 Drive Writes per day (JESD219 workload) 12.3 Petabytes Written (PBW) The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB drive looks like a beast with 4kB Random speeds of up to 550,000 IOPS read and 500,000 IOPS write! The endurance on this drive is 30 drive writes per day or 12.3 Petabyts Written! Intel Optane drives using 3D Xpoint don’t need to be over-provisioned like NAND-based drives nor does any defragmentation need to be done. Intel does keep a very small amount of spare space available Intel is specifying this drive a little different as they are now focusing on low Queue Depth performance and that is where this 3D XPoint drive really separates itself from traditional NAND SSDs in the enterprise market. Intel explained that most low depth matters and highlighted that most desktop PCs (client market) use queue depths of 1-4 on a regular basis and not much more than that. The data center is actually quite similar to this as most servers are running 2-6 VM’s on a server. Inside each of those VM’s are you have 1-2 threads and maybe Intel Hyper-Threading running and you’ll find out that most of the time you are at a QD of 16 or less for most all workloads. And, that is if all those workloads are accessing the storage at the same time and that is pretty rare. Intel noted that they are seeing most data center drives are being accessed between a QD of 4-8 and as SSDs or storage media in general gets faster, those queues get shorter as the workloads can’t keep up with the drives. This is pushing the queue depths down and in mixed workloads and low queue depths the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X brings 5-8x more performance at those low queue depths. In the chart above Intel compared the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X with 3D Xpoint memory versus the Intel SSD DC P3700 with NAND on a 4K 70/30 mixed RW performance test at a QD of 1-16 and found that as a QD of 1 the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X was 8x faster and then at a QD of 16 it was 5x faster, so while the maximum performance ratings of the drive aren’t insane, the numbers where Intel says it matter are dramatically different. When it comes to Quality of Service (QoS) the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X has 60x better than the Intel SSD DC P3700. To get this measurement Intel ran a 4K 70/30 mixed workload and during that workload Intel is measured the read latency. This is important as the applications waiting for data as they need that data to move forward. The y-access on this chart ranges from 0-3,00 us, so the top mark is just 3 milliseconds. Intel had to zoom into this level of analysis in order to even see the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X read latency results at the bottom of the chart. The slowest transactions on the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X are equivalent to the fastest transactions on the Intel SSD DC P3700, which is pretty crazy if you think about that for a second. Intel is looking at a new concept of testing data center drives and the result of this is shown in the chart above. The scenario is a multi-tenet environment where there is a VM that is running a database and that database is being read from and you want it to be responsive. The problem is that other tenets are also accessing the same database and that impacts your responsiveness due to what they are wanting to d.  The right hand xis is an offending random right workload (top stair step line) that steps up in time over the benchmark test. Intel then measures the latency of response of the reads. You got from latencies  in the 175us to 800us range on the Intel SSD DC P3700 (blue line) and you can see the average read latency go up as the workload ramps up.  The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X (orange line) is 20us or less!  Intel stopped the test at 750 MB/s because the Intel SSD DC P3700 couldn’t handle any more than that, but the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X can maintain this performance up to 2GB/s if the chart continued that far. When it comes to endurance, the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is rated for 30 drive writes per day and that is a conservative number. This number works out to offering 2.8x more Total Bytes Written (TBW) when compared to the Intel SSD DC P3700. Intel picked 2.8x as they were using a Intel SSD DC P3700 800GB and the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 750GB, so there is a little difference in the capacity of the drives and that impacts the specification. Where does Intel see Intel Optane SSD’s being used? Intel sees customers using this drive in a couple different ways: fast storage and cache or as extended memory. The fast storage and cache applications and in the data center that is where SSDs are being used today.  You can drop this in and it can be cache or fast storage tier, where you put your database files, it is just another storage device that you can drop in and just start using. You can also use it to extend memory and that is gets a little more complicated with both the DDR and PCIe bus, but it can be done. Intel showed an example where they had two MySQL servers configured and the database was too large to fit entirely inside the RAM. They then ran  Sysbench 0.5 with a 70/30 RW split and found that that Intel SSD DC P3700 could only handle 1,395 transactions per second where the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X could handle to 16,480 transactions per second. That number is impressive since the only difference between the systems was the SSD and Intel shows that as a cost savings per transaction as you can see in the chart above. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB PCIe model is the only capacity that Intel is talking about today (besides the 750GB model they used in the endurance chart) and that drive will be priced at $1,520 or $4.05 per GB with limited availability today and broad availability in the second half of 2017. Intel will also be offering a 750GB version of the drive in Q2 2017 and then a 1.5TB drive in the second half of 2017. The U.2 version should start coming to market in the second quarter of this year with the 375GB model leading the way. That price is nearly 3x the cost of the Intel SSD DC P3700 400GB Drive at $799.99 shipped, but you can see there are huge performance gains to be had. Now that Intel Optane SSDs have been released for data centers it is only going to be a short period of time until we see this technology come to the client side!   Check out LegitReviews' Polls on LockerDome on LockerDome Tweets by @LegitReviews Explore Editorial Events Interviews News Forum Folding Shop Content Bluetooth Cooling Editorial Events Interviews Memory Misc Mobile Mods and Ends Motherboards News PC Cases Power Supply Press Releases Processors Reviews Storage Video Cards About Contact Us Disclaimer About Us Follow Us         Copyright © 2002-2017 LegitReviews.com - All Rights Reserved.

By: Jon Coulter | Editorials in IT/Datacenter | Posted: 3 days, 21 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Introducing Intel's Optane with the Intel DC P4800X Enterprise/Datacenter SSD   Filling the gap     Today's current storage technologies leave a technology gap in data storage tiers. DRAM is far too expensive to scale, and while NAND has the capacity and cost structure to scale, it lacks sufficient performance to function in the memory space. To address the gap, a storage solution that behaves like system memory is needed. Intel's DC P4800X Datacenter SSD is designed to fill this gap, and it is the first SSD based on 3D XPoint memory technology to hit the market. Starting today, NAND flash is relegated to a lower performance storage media.     A new non-volatile storage media     For ten years, Intel has been working on 3D XPoint technology. While Intel has declined to reveal the specific material that makes 3D XPoint what it is, we speculate that it is a form of phase-change material or "PCM." Whatever the material actually is we do not know for sure at this point, but we do know that on a cellular level that 3D XPoint is 1000x faster and 1000x more enduring than NAND flash memory. If there were a way to integrate 3D XPoint onto the CPU, we could actually see this level performance. In the real-world, actual performance is limited by bus performance.     Optane - Intel's 3D XPoint     Intel calls their 3D XPoint technology "Optane." Optane consists of 3D XPoint memory, Intel memory and storage controllers, Intel interconnect IP and Intel software. 3D XPoint memory is a joint venture between Intel and Micron (IMFT). The actual IP outside of the memory itself is separate proprietary technology.       The Intel DC P4800X Datacenter SSD     Intel's DC P4800X is the first actual product based on 3D XPoint technology to hit the market. The DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage. The DC P4800X features a 7-channel Intel ASIC controller. Performance is best with an even die to channel loading. For the 375GB drive, there are four 128Gbit media die per channel or 28 die total. Spare capacity beyond the user capacity is minimal. It is used for ECC, firmware, and ensuring reliability meets the high standards customers expect of an Intel datacenter-class SSD.   3D XPoint memory media is a write-in-place media; there is no defragmentation needed, and therefore no performance can be gained in an Intel Optane SSD by increasing spare capacity. Additionally, capacity does not factor into a performance advantage like it typically does with NAND-based SSDs. A 375GB Optane SSD performs the same as a 1.5TB Optane SSD.     The Intel DC P4800X utilizes the NVMe software stack over a PCIe Gen3 x 4 interface. The DC P4800X can reach as much as 525,000 IOPS at a queue depth of 11. Contrast this with current flash-based NVMe SSDs that reach maximum performance at queue depths of 256, and it is easy to why the DC P4800X is the world's most responsive datacenter SSD. The DC P4800X running a 70/30 mixed random workload will deliver QoS that is up to 77x better than NAND flash-based NVMe SSDs.     The DC P4800X is designed to deliver 5-8x faster performance at low queue depth workloads than current NAND flash-based SSDs. Low queue depth random performance is by far the most important performance metric because whether it be enterprise or consumer type workloads, queue depths almost never exceed four queues.     Efficiency = Cost   Efficiency is intertwined with QoS (Quality of Service).     With Intel Optane SSDs improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service. This translates in up to 91% lower cost per transaction. This perfectly illustrates why you cannot afford not to have Optane in your datacenter.     Using Optane SSDs to Increase System Memory Pool   Bundle Optane SSDs with Intel Memory Drive Technology.     Intel's Memory Drive Technology enables datacenters to deliver more affordable memory pools by displacing a portion of DRAM or significantly grow the size of memory pools. When bundled with the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, Intel Memory Drive Technology transparently integrates the drive into the memory subsystem and makes the SSD appear like DRAM to the OS and applications. Due to the low latency and ultra-high endurance of the DC P4800X Series, it is optimal for use by Memory Drive Technology.     Together, the DRAM and the SSD emulate a single volatile memory pool. The software intelligently determines where data should be located in the pool to maximize performance, enabling servers to deliver performance across many workloads - even when DRAM is only supplying one-third to one-tenth of the memory pool capacity.     It turns out that Optane is everything it was cracked up to be. The Naysayers have turned out to be wrong. Intel sees Optane as creating a "New Normal." The new normal will be performance, endurance, and density that far exceeds the current normal offered by NAND flash-based storage.   Optane presents new opportunities and possibilities. Some new companies have been in waiting in "Stealth Mode" for Optane to become a reality. Without what Optane has to offer, their goals were not even feasible. As for us, we are excited to how the "New Normal" will evolve in both the consumer and enterprise space. Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

The TL;DR version is that the “Optane SSD DC P4800X” will ship by year-end, starting with a 375GB product that has amazing computed random read IOPS numbers, and can work as memory or as storage. Intel says the SSD is built with 3D Xpoint media, plus its own memory, controllers, interconnect IP and Intel software; we get it; wall-to-wall chipzilla tech makes the sucker go faster for longer, etc. It claims the P4800X has "an industry leading combination of low latency, high endurance, QoS and high throughput." IT has breakthrough performance, predictably fast service, is responsive under load and has "ultra endurance." Intel is pleased with the P4800X's latency under load, saying it's much better than its previous DC P3700 SSD, with a chart to prove it; Click chart for larger version. The "ultra" endurance claim rests upon the P4800X having a 30 drive writes per day (DWPD) rating compared to a 0.5 to 10 DWPD rating for NAND SSDs. It says the P4800X has up to 2.8x more total bytes written at similar capacity to a DC P3700 SSD with its 17 DWPD for 5 years. Performance Chipzilla says the P4800x has excellent performance at low queue depth. Here's the specs: Intel claims the P4800X is 5-8x at low queue depths and this is relevant because the majority of applications generate low queue depth workloads, rather than just relying on raw IOPS. It therefore says the P4800X is "Ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." Annoyingly Intel is not providing direct performance numbers, instead relying on multiples of DC P3700 SSD performance. This is a 2D 20nm MLC (2bits/cell) NAND drive launched in June 2014. P3700 capacity points are 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB and 2TB. Its sequential read/write IO latency is 20/20 microsecs. We’ve built a table comparing the two drives, using Intel-sourced numbers for the P3700 and then calculating the P4800X numbers using the Intel briefing multiples in the slide below. Intel slide comparing P3700 and P4800X SSD performance. All table numbers are “up to.” P3700 quality of service data can be found here and we’ve used the 400GB capacity write number. We were unable to find P3700 responsiveness under pressure numbers. Performance Category Parameter DC P3700 DC P4800X Comparative Multiple Derived P4800X Value Low Queue Depth 70/30 Mixed 150,000 8x 1,200,000 Random Read 460,000 10x 4,600,000 Random Write 175,000 3x 525,000 Quality of Service Read/Writes 99% 0.12/0.9 ms 60x 0.002/0.015 ms Reads/Writes 99.99% 4/0.5 ms 77x 0.052/0.0065 ms Responsiveness under Load 200MB/sec write pressure 12.5x ? 400MB/sec write pressure 25x ? 600MB/sec write pressure 35x ? Random Read IOPS The significant number for us here is the random read IOPS. Previously, and according to a leaked Optane P4800X datasheet, the random read IOPS were up to 550,000. Our computed value of 4,600,000 is so far away from 550,000 as to leave us incredulous. And yet Intel's Optane deck is Intel's Optane deck and Intel's DC P3700 random read IOPS number is indeed Intel's DC P3700 random read IOPS. Intel DC P3700 performance numbers. Click image for larger view. Perhaps computing a number from two "up to" numbers is taking us some way away from the real world? An expert technology exec who has been close to 3D Xpoint commented; As for Intel's claims, they are plausible. 3D Xpoint is certainly fast enough media. The question is, can their controller/firmware provide such a figure? The world's best NAND devices are around 1 million 4K random reads, at high queue depth loads. NVMe allows 64K queues each of 64K depth, and to the extent Intel has leveraged that capability, 4.6 million is certainly not out of the question. How does it compare to competing NVMe SSDs? Samsung's PM1725a NVMe SSD (48-layer 3D TLC NAND) does up to 1,050,00 random read IOPS. The next fastest we could find is Seagate's Nytro XP7200 which does 940,000. The 4.6 million number is amazing. We have asked Intel to verify it and a spokesperson said; The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is spec’d at queue depths at or below 16, which is where the figures come from on that slide. The P3700 specs are at much higher queue depths. At a QD of 16, Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is 10x better than the DC P3700. So the P4800X's random read IOPS number is less than 4,600,000 but we don't know by how much. Grrr. Moving on The 70/30 mixed IOPS value for the P3700 comes from an Intel webpage and applies to the 400GB P3700. With regard to the QoS the improvement of 60x at 90 per cent and 77x at 99.99 per cent means the difference between the two percentage levels is reduced, which is a good thing. The 3D Xpoint DC P4800X SSD Intel suggests the P4800X is used as fast storage and cache or to to bulk out DRAM, with its PCIE 3D NAND SSDS providing a tier of storage below Xpoint. Future Intel Xpoint DIMMs will also increase the memory pool in a server. The company also claims that the DC P4800X integrates transparently into memory subsystems, thanks to “Intel Memory Drive Technology” that loads after the BIOS but before the OS. That software makes it possible to create a single pool of memory comprising DRAM and the P4800X SSD to emulate a single volatile memory pool. This will work on any OS, but does need a Xeon CPU to make the magic happen. Optane SSDs can provide DRAM-like performance, it says, in select applications, such as ones with matrix multiplication with optimised data locality. Chipzilla's keen to point out Optane will be cheaper than DRAM, too. Listed OEMS for the DC P3800X include Dell EMC and HPE, both of which plans to use it as a tier of cache, plus Lenovo, Nutanix and Supermicro. As for how the P4800X' performance compares to Intel's original 3D XPoint performance claims - such as being 1,000 times faster than flash with up to 1,000 times flash's endurance and 10 times denser than conventional memory - we're bored with the whole farrago and don't intend to go there. For now Intel is only shipping the DC P4800x to special friend. Broader availability will start in the second half of this year; a 6-month window. The detailed availability info is; AIC 375GB - Initial Mar 19, broad 2H 750GB - Q2 1.5TB - 2H U.2 375GB - Q2 750GB - 2H 1.5TB - 2H We're also told that Optane will eventually make it onto DIMMs, but there's no timeframe for that happening. ® Tips and corrections 23 Comments More from The Register MacBook killer?

Peter Bright - Mar 19, 2017 4:00 pm UTC A 3D XPoint wafer. Intel reader comments 173 Share this story Intel announced today the first Optane-branded product using its new 3D XPoint memory: the catchily named Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It's a 375GB SSD on a PCIe card. Initial limited availability starts today, for $1520, with broad availability in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, a 750GB PCIe model, and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor will be released, and in the second half of the year, a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 stick, are planned. 3D XPoint is a new kind of persistent solid state memory devised by Intel and Micron. Details on how the memory actually works remain scarce—it's generally believed to use some kind of change in resistance to record data—but its performance characteristics and technical capabilities make it appealing for a wide range of applications. When it was first announced in 2015, Intel claimed it would be 1,000 times faster than NAND flash, 10 times denser than DRAM, and 1,000 times better endurance than NAND, though without saying "faster at what" or "what kind of NAND" or anything like that. With the shipping product, these comparisons are now clearer, as one of Intel's slides make clear: 3D XPoint has about one thousandth the latency of NAND flash (or about ten times the latency of DRAM), and tens times the density of DRAM. The raw specs for the P4800X leaked in February. To summarize: it's a datacenter-oriented part, built for applications with high read/write loads, looking for low latency. The sequential transfer rates of 2400MB/s read, 2000MB/s write, are good, but some of the fastest NAND flash can pull slightly ahead. Where the P4800X excels is its ability to sustain high I/O loads, courtesy of those low latencies. Enlarge Intel SSD manufacturers often quote huge numbers of I/O operations per second (IOPS), but there's always a footnote: the figures are typically generated with queue depths of 32, which is to say, the drive is bombarded with read or write requests (depending on what is being measured) so that there are always 32 outstanding operations. With these deep queues, NAND flash SSDs can achieve 3-400,000 IOPS. The P4800X can do 550,000 read IOPS and 500,000 write IOPS, but critically, Intel says it achieves this even at low queue depths. The spec sheet figure has a queue depth of 16, and the company says that a queue depth of about 8 tends to be about the limit seen in the real world. Moreover, Intel says that the latency of each I/O operation remains low even under heavy load. 99.999 percent of operations have a read or write latency below 60 or 100 microseconds (respectively) with a queue depth of 1, rising to 150 or 200 microseconds with a queue depth of 16. Under a comparable load, Intel's own P3700 NAND SSD can only serve 99 percent of operations with a latency below about 2,800 microseconds. Likewise, under sustained write workloads, the P4800X retains its low latency for reads, whereas the read latency of the P3700 NAND steadily deteriorates as the write bandwidth increases. This already makes the Optane drive interesting for applications like caching, but Intel is aiming at more than just that. 3D XPoint is byte addressable; that is to say, each individual byte can be overwritten. This sets it apart from NAND flash. NAND is typically arranged in pages of 512, 2048, or 4096 bytes. Pages are arranged into blocks, typically of 16, 128, 256, or 512 kilobytes. Reading and writing takes place at page granularity, but each page can only be written once. To write it again, it must first be erased, and erasure takes place not at page granularity, but at block granularity. Spinning hard disks can perform reads and writes at the granularity of a sector, typically either 512 bytes (or 512 bytes plus some extra bookkeeping space), or 4096 bytes (or 4096 plus some extra). With 3D XPoint, the reads and writes can occur on individual bytes. Enlarge Intel Unlike flash, which physically wears out due to the stress placed by erases, 3D XPoint writes are non-destructive. This gives the drives much greater endurance than NAND of a comparable density, with Intel saying that Optane SSDs can safely be written 30 times per day, compared to a typical 0.5-10 whole drive writes per day. The low latency and high endurance make Optane a good fit for applications like caching and database servers. But taking further advantage of these two properties, Intel has developed a new way of using Optane. The P4800X can be used as a regular PCIe attached SSD, but Intel has developed something it calls "Memory Drive Technology" that allows the P4800X, when used in conjunction with an appropriate chipset and processor (which means you'll have to use a Xeon processor), can be used as if it were RAM. Optane's latency and bandwidth are both worse than that of DRAM, but the density is higher, and the price substantially lower. Enlarge Intel Memory Drive Technology uses a middleware layer that boots before, and is transparent to, the operating system, and it combines regular DRAM with the SSD to make a single large pool of volatile memory. For most workloads, this will be slightly slower than if the same amount of DRAM were being used, but the cost should be substantially lower, and the power consumption modestly improved. Intel even claims that some workloads will go faster; although Optane "memory" is slower than regular RAM, the middleware layer that manages the memory can move data around so that it is closer to the processor that is using it, which can assist when using NUMA configurations. The biggest benefit may be from substantially increasing the amount of physical memory in a server: 2 socket Xeon systems can hold up to 3TB of RAM, but 24TB of Optane, and 4 socket systems support up to 12TB RAM, but 48TB Optane. This could be a huge boost for applications that need truly enormous quantities of memory. If using the PCIe bus to attach storage and then use it as memory seems a bit awkward, next year Intel plans to release Optane DIMMS. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. Dell's powerful 15-inch Precision 5520 now has the latest Intel Xeon processor and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. This bulldozer of a PC with a 4K display may be your best bet if you're a graphics professional. Here's why. At first glance, you may confuse the new Dell Precision 5520 with the more common XPS 15 (9560). That's because in many ways they are the same, but with some key differences, because the Precision 5520 is aimed at enterprise and professional users rather than consumers. Those differences come down to two areas — the CPU and GPU — but there are some other fundamental differences as well. Much of this review will seem similar to my XPS 15 (9560) review, in which I rated it as one of the top and most powerful non-gamer laptops around. Here I'll focus on the Xeon processor, Quadro graphics and a few other hardware differences. XPS 15 versus Precision 5520. Which is which? About this review The Precision 5520 was supplied by Dell for this review. It features a 4K IGZO display, 32GB of RAM, Intel Xeon processor, NVIDIA Quadro graphics and 512GB of Class 50 solid-state drive (SSD). The starting price for the Precision 5520 is $1,399. The unit we evaluated in this review retails for $2,867. See at Dell Hardware choices and differences Like many professional laptops, Dell offers a full gamut of hardware options for the Precision 5520 that often mirrors those of the XPS 15 line. Dell lets you choose between the UltraSharp matte Full HD (1920 x 1080) Infinity Edge display or the UltraSharp IGZO 4K (3840 x 2160) Glossy touchscreen found in the XPS 15. The Precision 5520 looks exactly like an XPS 15 (9560). For the processor, Dell lets you configure the Precision 5520 with an Intel Core i5-7300HQ (2.5GHz and 3.5GHz Turbo), slightly faster Core i5-7440HQ (2.8GHz and 3.8GHz Turbo), or the Intel Core i7-7820HQ (2.9GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo). None of those are consumer processors, because they bring support for Intel vPro and Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX-NI) technology. Both technologies are important to different groups, namely enterprise, programmers and other professionals. They have no practical consumer application. Dell Precision 5520 specifications Category Dell Precision 5520 Processor Intel Core i5-7300HQ (2.5GHz and 3.5GHz Turbo) Intel Core i5-7440HQ (2.8GHz and 3.8GHz Turbo) Intel Core i7-7820HQ (2.9GH and 3.9GHz Turbo) Intel Xeon E3-1505M v6 (3.0GHz and 4.0GHz Turbo) Internal storage Up to 1TB SSD SATA, Class 40, Class 50 PCIe at various sizes RAM 8GB ,16GB, or 32GB DDR4 2400 MHz 2 DIMMs Display 1080p matte, non-touch 4K glossy, full touch Graphics Intel HD Discrete graphics NVIDIA Quadro M1200 4GB GDDR5 Ports HDMI 1.4 two USB 3.0 with PowerShare Headset jack SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC) Kensington Lock slot USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 Wireless Dell 8820 | Intel 8265 Out-of-band systems management Yes (Intel vPro) Battery 56WHr or 97WHr Weight 3.93 lbs (1.78 kg) to 4.56 lbs (2.06 kg) Colors Silver Besides the big Core processors, all of which are the last generation "Skylake" variants, there is the big kahuna with the Xeon E3-1505M v6. Introduced this year, this Intel Xeon is a quad-core processor with support for ECC memory, 8MB of cache (up from the usual 6MB in a consumer Core i7), and a slightly higher base clock rate of 3.00 GHz with Turbo up to 4.00 GHz. These specs make it one of the fastest mobile processors around, besting the Core i7-7700HQ found in the XPS 15 (9560) by 200MHz. That CPU will cost you an extra $392 compared to the base Core i5-7300HQ. For graphics, you can opt for the native Intel HD type found with the Core processors or add a dedicated GPU for an extra $70. That discrete GPU option comes in the form of the new NVIDIA Quadro M1200 with 4GB of GDDR5 memory and contrasts with the XPS 15 (9560), which has the powerful NVIDIA GTX 1050. On benchmarks, the GTX 1050 beats out the Quadro, but the latter is not meant for gaming or consumer applications. Instead, Quadro graphics are optimized for things such as 2D computer-aided design (CAD) programs (Autodesk or Solidworks), OpenCL work (as opposed to DirectX, and not to be confused with OpenGL), and they're considered a "professional solution." In other words, if you need a Quadro card, you'll likely know it due to your job requirements. Other perks with the Precision 5520 are more storage solutions, including the top-tier SSD, right now the Samsung SM961, which is equivalent to the consumer Samsung 960 PRO. That SSD has ludicrous read times of 3,200 MB/s and writes up to 1,800 MB/s, which again are ideal speeds for those working with large CAD outputs and professional workloads that require a lot of writing to disk. Finally, instead of a consumer-focused Killer AC-1535 wireless card, the Precision 5520 can get the similar Intel AC-8265 wireless card with Bluetooth 4.2. Design and build quality The XPS 15 and Precision 5520 have the same chassis designs, down to the black carbon fiber interior with soft touch paint and machined metal for the outside shell. At this point, Dell's design choices here are almost "classic" for the Precision and XPS line, because they've been used for some time. That's a good choice, as the Precision 5520 is solid feeling, especially because it's a 15.6-inch laptop packed into the frame of a 14-inch PC. Combined with the heavier 4K touch display, the Precision 5520 grips well and should hold up for a few years of being tossed into a bag every day. Choice of color is limited to the standard silver without any options for "rose gold," unlike the XPS 13 (9360). No option for Windows Hello One deviation from the XPS 15 (9560) is the lack of a $25 optional Synaptics fingerprint reader for instant log-ins using Windows Hello. It's an odd oversight due to the inclusion of features like vPro, and it may be coming in a later release. Keyboard and Precision trackpad are solid performers The Precision 5520's keyboard uses plastic keys with 1.3mm of travel, which is a bit on the shallow side. This shallow travel results in a faster "bottoming-out" experience compared to keyboards that offer 1.5mm or more of travel. It's not bad, but it takes a little time to get used to if you're coming from a desktop keyboard. Still, it's a good keyboard with no fatal flaws. The keys are backlit and turn on automatically based on the surrounding environment. The backlight brightens the letters and surrounds the keys. There are also two levels of brightness that users can select using the Function key. The keys are black, and the backlight is white, so the contrast is good. Where the Precision 5520's keyboard is unremarkable, the trackpad is a much better story. It is Precision, relying on Microsoft's drivers and settings for performance versus Synaptics, which I only tolerate these days. That also means more robust support through Microsoft, especially with the forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update due in April, which adds even more gestures and customization for Precision Touchpads. A 4K IGZO display to love Like the XPS 15, the Precision 5520 comes in two variants, one with a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) Matte, non-touch display and the other with the more popular 4K (3840 x 2160) IGZO IPS touch screen. Neither panel has changed from last year's Precision or XPS models, and both rank at the top of my favorite laptop displays. Both display types are also nearly bezel-less, what Dell calls "Infinity Edge" in its marketing. The Full HD version results in a lighter laptop — 4.32 lbs (1.96 kg) versus 4.56 lbs (2.06 kg) — which is not a huge difference but it is noticeable. Also, the Full HD version will net about an extra three hours of battery life over the 4K option. Not every consumer needs a full 4K panel on a 15-inch laptop, but it makes sense with the Precision 5520 due to it being aimed at graphics professionals who need the higher resolution and more accurate colors. In calibration tests, the 4K panel measured 99 percent sRGB, and the extra presets through Dell Premier Color, such as Cinema (DCI-P3), Photo (Adobe RGB), HD Video (Rec. 709), and Vibrant (Full), are invaluable tools for video editors. The Full HD matte display reached an excellent 97 percent sRGB rating. Both displays are outstanding, but they offer unique experiences. The non-touch matte is better for reading and writing due to the anti-glare design. It goes without saying that neither has a fantastic webcam experience due to the odd placement of the camera below the display. The camera works well enough, but the angle is not flattering. That's a small price to pay for the super-thin bezels on the top and sides. Benchmarks and performance The strength of the maxed-out Precision 5520 comes down to that Xeon processor, which can ramp up to 4GHz via turbo. It's a powerful CPU edging out the consumer-orientated Core i7-7700HQ due to the extra 200MHz. Taking a closer look at Geekbench 4.0, which is very CPU dependent, you can see how the Precision 5520 takes the lead compared to other high-end PCs. Geekbench 4.0 benchmarks (higher is better) Device Single Core Multi Core Precision 5520 4,799 15,055 XPS 15 (9560) 4,503 13,587 Surface Studio 4,200 13,323 Razer Blade 14 3,774 12,638 Razer Blade Pro 3,660 12,325 XPS 13 (9360) 4,120 7,829 Spectre x360 15 4,098 8,022 Surface Book Performance Base 3,948 7,415 Things shift a bit with Futuremark, mostly because of the NVIDIA Quadro GPU. As mentioned earlier, that GPU is optimized for CAD, rendering and other professional environments that are not reliant on DirectX 12. Launched in January 2017, the Quadro M1200 Mobile is a very new professional solution GPU for workstations. The GPU operates at 1093MHz with memory running at 1253MHz, and it draws just 45W. The M1200 Mobile features 640 shading units, 40 texture mapping units and 32 ROPs, and it ships with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. The Quadro M1200 Mobile also supports DirectX 12, which is a significant change from previous versions.

That's not a fair comparison, of course, but it's still instructive for those curious about the differences in architecture and performance of the M1200 Mobile. Obviously, for consumers who have more interest in gaming, the XPS 15's new NVIDIA GTX 1050 is a better solution. Turning to storage and Precision 5520 does quite well. The results here are dependent on purchasing the PCIe 512GB SSD Class 50 (an extra $479), which evidently means the Samsung SM961, one of the fastest SSDs on the market today. That SSD is the OEM version of the prosumer Samsung 960 PRO. Choosing a cheaper Class 40 or SATA will bring slower read and write times. CrystalDiskMark (higher is better) Device Read Write Precision 5520 (SM961) 2,491 MB/s 1,602 MB/s Razer Blade Pro (RAID-0) 2,571 MB/s 2,467 MB/s Dell XPS 15 (9560) 2,207 MB/s 1,628 MB/s Razer Blade (960 EVO) 2,079 MB/s 1,809 MB/s Surface Book 1,018 MB/s 967 MB/s The Razer Blade Pro is the outlier because it actually uses two Samsung PM961s (960 EVOs) in a RAID zero setup, which is quite extreme and unusual. While an expensive choice, it's great that Dell lets you pick and choose the storage solution for the Precision 5520, unlike in the XPS 15 line where PCIe SSD can mean everything from a modest Toshiba to a powerful Samsung PM961 (960 EVO). Overall, the performance of the Precision 5520 is as expected for a mobile workstation. Of course, a lot of that depends on how you configure the device during the ordering process. Maxing out to the Xeon processor, along with 32GB of RAM and Class 50 SSD will yield the highest overall performance, but the total cost will be just shy of $3,000. For Wi-Fi, the Precision 5520 can either come with a Dell 1820 or Intel 8265 depending on user choice. My advice: Get the Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 8265. The 8265 is the fourth generation of Intel 802.11ac, and it offers support for newer features such as MU-MIMO, 802.11r, 802.11k, and 802.11v. Plus, Intel has the best Wi-Fi drivers in the business, and they have fewer problems. Considering it costs nothing extra for the Intel card, there's no downside. If you prefer a Killer Wireless card you can swap it out yourself for about $35. Finally, like the XPS 15 (9560), the Precision 5520 is easy to upgrade for more RAM, SSD, and Wi-Fi down the road. There are two DIMM slots for RAM, so you can easily order 16GB and replace the two sticks with 32GB (two 16GB sticks) at 2,400MHz should you need it. The SSD is also simple to replace if you need more (or faster) storage. Precision 5520 battery longevity Despite packing a Xeon processor at 3GHz, the Precision 5520 with 4K display gets around seven hours of battery life at 50 percent brightness and while doing moderate, non-GPU intensive Windows tasks. That's with the larger 97WHr battery. (There's a smaller, cheaper 56WHr option, as well.) While not that's not a massive number considering the speed of the CPU, the Quadro graphics, 4K display, and 32GB of RAM, it is impressive for a mobile workstation. If you push the Quadro GPU to full throttle for extending time while doing CAD, it will likely cut in half that battery result. Stepping down to a slightly slower Core i7 or Core i5 will likely yield more battery longevity, but not nearly as much as switching to the Full HD matte display. Going to the lower resolution screen should add two to three hours of life. That's a tough choice to make, so consider the pros and cons of each. Smart software: Dell Command and Precision Optimizer Dell's included software (McAfee notwithstanding) is all excellent. Besides Dell Premier Color, which lets you toggle color profiles, adjust white balance, and contrast for the IGZO 4K display, Dell also includes Dell Command and its Precision Optimizer. Dell Command and Precision Optimizer are great included apps. Dell Command checks for system updates and can pull down new drivers or updates for the other Dell software. It's simple to use and has an excellent design. The Dell Precision Optimizer app is more impressive. It allows users to see the utilization of their CPU, GPU, storage activity and memory, along with detailed system information. There are also Independent Software Vendor (ISV) presets that tune the Precision 5520 with popular professional apps, including AutoCAD, 3dsmax, Fluent and Illustrator. The system can also do an analysis of the hardware using data collection and workload usage for custom profile optimizations. It's all clever software, and I wish Dell would include something like Dell Command in its XPS lineup. (Consumers can technically go and download it themselves, but it needs to be configured.) Dell Precision 5520: A powerful mobile workstation worth buying The Precision 5520 is very much like the Dell XPS 15 (9560), with only a few key differences in the internal hardware. Those changes don't benefit consumers, but for mobile professionals, architects, video editors and others who need a Quadro GPU for work, the Precision 5520 is a perfect solution for their needs. Delivering the same excellent build quality, Infinity Edge 4K display, and ample hardware selection, there's not much to ding the Precision 5520 for in everyday use. It is curious that a fingerprint reader is not an option, which would seem apropos for this category. But perhaps Dell will add that down the road. See my review of the Dell XPS 15 (9560) Dell should still solve the oddly-placed webcam issue. and like the XPS line. Precision could maybe use some sprucing up in the design department. Still, these are minor complaints. There's nothing wrong with the looks of the Precision 5520 and considering it's for professional developers and architects, the conservative design is more appropriate. Performance and battery are the top for this class, and there are few choices in the category that look as good while lasting most of the day untethered from a power cord. If you need things like Intel vPro and Quadro graphics for work, the Precision 5520 has you covered. You'll look good using it too. See at Dell Pros: Excellent SSD, GPU, RAM and CPU options. Perfect professional-class mobile workstation. High-quality machined aluminum and carbon fiber build. Best display in its class (matte FHD and glossy 4K). Outstanding battery life, especially in Full HD. Large Precision touchpad. Cons: Web camera is still oddly placed. Can be expensive.

Israel is gaining a name as the builder of car brains. — Picture by Jeff Swensen/The New York TimesJERUSALEM, March 19 — Intel’s US$15-billion (RM66.5 billion) purchase of Israeli firm Mobileye could help fuel the country’s rise in the driverless car industry — not as a builder of vehicles, but as the brains behind them. Monday’s deal, the largest ever in Israel’s tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled “startup nation” has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than US$1 billion for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday’s US$15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi — considered one of the fathers of Israel’s high-tech startup scene — said the automobile industry’s growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. “It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology.” In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don’t involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed “Siri for cars.” Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. “Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars,” he said. “Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving.” ‘Doors will open’ Vardi said the country’s military experience, with some of the world’s most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. “When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate,” Vardi said. “This kind of talent you find in the military — in airplanes etc.” The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around US$70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by “somewhere between 25 to 40 per cent.” “We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising,” he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking US$10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. “Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time,” he told AFP. “Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles,” he said. “Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier.” — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Banksy’s West Bank hotel to receive first guests Russia summoned Israeli ambassador over Syria strikes Israel carries out air strikes on Syria Israel brands Palestinian fund ‘terrorist’ organisation UN report: Israel imposes apartheid regime on Palestinians Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Is NVIDIA Corporation Running Out of Steam or Taking a Breather? NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the hottest stocks in 2016, surging 220% throughout the year and crushing the NASDAQ’s 20% gain. But that rally abruptly petered out in 2017, and the stock has declined 3% year-to-date. Does that weak start indicate that NVIDIA could be running out of steam? Or is the stock merely taking a breather before fresh catalysts propel it to new highs? Let’s take a closer look at the bearish and bullish cases to find out. NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 powered Roborace vehicle. Image source: NVIDIA. Why NVIDIA might be running out of steam A common bearish argument against NVIDIA is that the stock simply got ahead of itself. NVIDIA’s current P/E of 40 marks a multi-year high and doesn’t compare favorably to analyst expectations for 10% non-GAAP earnings growth this year. That’s a significant slowdown from its  83% growth in fiscal 2017. NVIDIA’s revenue is only expected to rise 16% this year, compared to 38% growth in 2017. Several factors are causing this slowdown. First, the expiration of NVIDIA’s graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) this month will reduce its  revenues by $66 million per quarter. While that impact might seem small relative to the $2.2 billion in revenues it generated last quarter, it was „free” revenue which went directly to NVIDIA’s bottom line and accounted for 9% of its non-GAAP net income. NVIDIA also faces fresh competition in its high-growth gaming GPU and automotive CPU markets this year. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) will launch its next-gen Vega GPUs within  the next three months, which could put a lot of pressure on NVIDIA’s current-gen Pascal-based GeForce cards. NVIDIA’s high-end GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel  are both aggressively scaling up their automotive chip businesses. Qualcomm will likely close its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors , making it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world. Intel recently announced that it will acquire Mobileye , which  supplies 90% of the world’s top automakers with collision detection systems. Both Qualcomm and Intel believe that these purchases will bolster their presence in connected and driverless cars — which could threaten NVIDIA’s early lead with Tegra processors. Intel has also taken notice of NVIDIA’s progress in data centers, where it’s been pairing its Tesla GPUs with non-Intel CPUs for machine-learning purposes. To strike back, Intel recently launched its new „Knights Landing” Xeon Phi processor, which reportedly outperformed the Tesla GPUs in  several scientific benchmarks. Why NVIDIA might be taking a breather NVIDIA faces more challenges this year than it did before, but the company has kept its core businesses healthy with a steady stream of fresh partnerships. In the driverless car market, NVIDIA partnered with Baidu to develop a driverless platform last  August, partnered with Bosch to create a next-gen driving supercomputer called  Xavier in early 2017, and unveiled a proof-of-concept autonomous truck with Paccar  in March. In the data center market, NVIDIA launched a new hyperscale GPU accelerator blueprint with Microsoft  in March, which is aimed at strengthening its cloud-based AI computing capabilities. NVIDIA also pushed back against AMD in the console market by supplying Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) with the Tegra X1 SoC for its new Switch console. Initial demand for  the Switch seems strong, which indicates that the console could become a new pillar of growth for the Tegra line alongside connected cars. The Nintendo Switch. Image source: Nintendo. As for gaming GPUs, NVIDIA plans to counter AMD’s Vega with  its next-gen Volta GPUs. The Volta probably won’t arrive until early 2018, but hardcore gamers might skip the Vega in favor of this next-gen chipset. All these factors indicate that its core growth businesses of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and Tegra CPUs should all continue growing for the foreseeable future. The verdict: NVIDIA is just taking a breather NVIDIA faces a lot more headwinds than it did before, but it’s still making solid progress across the gaming, AI, and connected car markets. Its P/E of 40 admittedly looks high, but investors should also note that the stock also trades at  37 times 2018 earnings, 31 times 2019 earnings, and 24 times 2020 earnings — so that multiple will eventually cool off to more reasonable levels. Investors shouldn’t expect NVIDIA to repeat its massive gains from last year, but they also shouldn’t believe the stock will fall off a cliff. I believe that the stock will trade sideways over the next few quarters, until the company proves that new challenges from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm won’t throttle its long-term growth.

View Latest Posts >>> Vault 7 Leak Exposes a Secret War against We The People By Preston James, Ph.D on March 19, 2017 The Vault 7 leak has merely disclosed the tip of the Secret Shadow Government iceberg. It quickly becomes obvious that there is also Secret Space War program and secret Deep Underground Military Base program that the CIA runs interference for. by  Preston James Note: This is a long article, and involves information you were never supposed to find out about. Over the years, hundreds have been murdered who bucked this evil system, and thousands of good Americans from all walks of life and positions (low and high) have been harassed into silence. Thankfully all secrecy is ending bit by bit thanks to the Internet, the New Gutenberg Press. The CIA and the Secret Shadow Government are desperate to stop these disclosures and doing everything they can, but such efforts are now doomed. This article is dedicated to all the innocent blood and ruined lives of all the many thousands of the CIA’s victims, including many children ritually abused and sacrificed for control, power and money.  To save time, you can read the bold print and the conclusion to get a pretty good summary of the article. Thanks to the Vault 7 leak the curtain has been pulled back and the CIA’s massive crime spree against We The People has now been exposed. And it’s just the tip of the iceberg. This disclosure of CIA RICO crimes is just 1% of what will be coming in future months about the CIA’s dirty secret crimes against We The People and the existence of a massive secret war against We The People by a Secret American “invisible” Government, best referred to as the Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Yes, not only do the Vault 7 disclosures disclose massive illegal CIA spying against the American people, but they also suggest that a major war is being waged against We The People by a Secret Shadow Government (SSG) most of the American masses never heard of, something never mentioned in the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM). The original reason that the CIA was created was because of the cold war with the Soviet Union and China, at least this is what was claimed to the American public. We now know for certain that the large subterranean Intel monster best referred to as the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) was spawned from and by the CIA’s excessive secrecy and tendency to commit an endless series of serious crimes, all rationalized under the misused concept of “protecting national security”. Here is the secret process by which this all occurred. Paperclip scientists in America – US Sponsorship was not limited to German physicists and engineers At the end of WW2, the USG decided to import the Nazi spy system. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was the clandestine arm of the US Military during WW2 and realized that they were ill equipped to spy on the Soviet Union effectively. So at the end of WW2 efforts were made by the US Army to convince President Truman and his top advisers that it was essential to import the Nazi’s ready made Intel system which they believed had fully penetrated the Soviet Union. But the immediate impetus to create the CIA by passing the National Security Act of 1947 was the UFO crash with 5 alien ET bodies and one live ET survivor from another nearby crash sent the Army Air Corps into shock. Roswell depiction This Roswell incident sent major shock-waves through the highest echelons of the US Military High Command, the president and several of the top Senators who were briefed. That very night that the Roswell incident was exposed in an article published in the newswires that a flying saucer had crashed and been recovered at Roswell, absolute secrecy was locked down and a phony weather balloon cover story was quickly substituted under threat of court martial. Years later when witnesses began to adequately debunk this, another second fake cover story was presented that it was the crash test of a Project Mogul test dummy. That too has now been fully debunked. When the National Security Act of 1947 was passed, President Truman in essence unknowingly signed away US sovereignty by allowing the creation of a Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Years later he realized this mistake and was sorry, or at least that is what he claimed. From that point on from the moment it was created by the national Security Act, the CIA morphed into the secret control arm of the Fourth Reich, a reconstituted three-piece suit Third Reich that had formed an symbiotic alliance with US Intel over Alien ET technologies gained from recovered crashed UFOs, one in Bavaria for example. This is an extreme claim that the CIA became the Intel arm of the new Forth Reich but one that has legs. And here is how it happened. After the end WW2, President Truman and his Military High Command imported over 9,000 Nazi scientists, technicians, bio-weapons experts, spy-chiatrists and mind-kontrollers, and Intel agents under Operation Paperclip. Midway through the war, US Naval Intel had become aware of the secret Nazi weapons research on jet aircraft, rockets, nuclear bombs and anti-gravity craft. US Navy Intel had deeply penetrated these secret Nazi weapons programs. And naval Intel was fully aware that the Nazis had recovered crashed UFOs, had formed a working alliance with an Alien ET group which abandoned them midstream. Senior US Naval Intel Officials knew the Allies would win the war and wanted to be able to get control over those technologies and the technicians working on them before the Russian could. A special deal was negotiated through back channels with certain Nazi Intel officials and General Kammler to do this before the war’s end. Secret negotiations were made through back-channels before the end of the war with General Kammler to import all this technology and those Nazis involved into the USA at the end of the war and give them full immunity if they agreed to work for the USA. So the USG wanted not only all this Nazi secret technology, it wanted access to what they believed was the Nazi’s exceptionally proficient network of spies deeply embedded inside the Soviet Union. However, General Kammler had a secret plan. He decided that he would share the rocketry, and guidance systems and the jet aircraft but would hold back on much of the Alien ET technologies and instead attempt to create a secret separate Nazi space program running parallel. In a strange unanticipated turn of events, many of the top technicians working on de Glocke (the Bell) and related anti-gravity were murdered so they could not talk or be taken to America. It has been suspected and rumored that a select group of the best were Scientists and technicians working on anti-gravity were secretly transported to South America, some say to a secret base in Antarctica. This group of Nazi scientists and technicians was to re-establish connections to a Alien ET group and continue developing weapons. What happened to them is unclear but perhaps will be disclosed with all the big disclosures coming soon over Antarctic archaeological digs, which according to rumors may involve beings frozen in the ice from ancient times and alien ET matters. After NASA was developed, it was rumored that a secret Nazi section was developed to set up Space War division to rival the USAF and the USN’s. Because of all the excess well-compartmented secrecy levels set up based on “need to know” only, it is always difficult to get accurate information on any of this. This cylinder device generated a tremendous vortex in the etheric field by counter-rotating mercury plasma, though many speculate it was merely an anti-gravity flying device, it seems more likely to have been a primitive attempt to create an artificial ‘wormhole’ portal that could pierce the quarantine barrier. The Bell project and its designers vanished just before WWII’s end. Up until about five years ago, any mention of the Secret Space War program usually resulted in the discloser being murdered without mercy. The late New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff (1947-1998) Some of the murders have seemed to be from defense contractor security teams, but others are suspected of being from strange “Men in Black” (MIBs who have been alleged to be human looking Alien ETs). Over the last 20 years those who run the programs, Majestic Twelve, has had a big split in perspectives among its members with the younger set wanting disclosure and pushing for it. This split has allowed a softening of the policy to immediately murder anyone disclosing. And now with Dr. Steven Greer’s disclosure project over 100 American heroes have disclosed collectively. Offers have been made to present all this in open Congressional hearing, but because NM Congressman Schiff appeared to have been murdered (CIA Flu) trying to break it open, most Members of Congress are too afraid of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) to attempt to set up disclosure hearings. If you think the claims that the USN had serious Intel during WW2 from inside the Nazi high technology programs that dealt with recovered UFOs and Alien ET partners is complete bunk, not so fast. Jeff Rense (of Rense.com) who is a Veterans Today affiliate has a Radio Network which carries some remarkable guests. One of his recent guests is a highly respected man William Tompkins, who has produced supporting credentials showing long term participation in the Secret Space War program. Some of these very interesting Rense programs with William Tompkins have been posted on Rense.com and also on Youtube.com and are well worth listening too. Take the time to listen to this remarkable man before you just discount such claims out of hand about the Navy penetrating Nazi alien ET/UFO high technology development during WW2. These matters are incredulous to most and even for a period of time to those who have worked in these programs at the highest levels. Yes, this is “twilight zone” time, but you will find it to be real if you do enough deep research. In 1990 the respected “Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine” confirmed development of exotic top-secret flight machines. In two feature articles, the lid was ever so slightly lifted on super-classified projects under way at Nellis AFB in Nevada and Edwards AFB in California. Both bases “…have been home to ‘classified’ vehicles for decades.” But here is what we actually do know for certain. Nazi Intel Gehlen and Mueller were brought over and used to help set up the CIA under the infamous, now declassified Operation Paperclip. Joseph Mengele  (aka Dr. Green) traveled in and out of America from his South American home and was brought over to help set up the CIA’s secret Mind-kontrol programs, which included MK-Ultra and numerous subprograms, many of which are ongoing even to this very day, although completely denied.  Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were supportive of the Nazis. Prescott and GHWB both have been accused of being secret Nazis. Prescott for his part in the Union bank support for the Nazis in WW2, in which he was arrested but given immunity to become an “informant,” as long as he signed an agreement that his progeny would never run for political office. Caught with his pants down literally! Sandy Berger was caught attempting to steal this document out of the national security archives and received a minimal hand-slapping where anyone else would have  been given a life sentence. GHWB was responsible for running CIA Op40 (run out of Room 40 at Langley which mimicked the old British room 40 Intel group from WW2. GHWB’s reward for murdering JFK and stopping his plan to break up the CIA into a thousand pieces was to become head of the CIA, Vice President and then President. It was GHWB that ran the assassination attempt on President Reagan for the CIA and formed a strong alliance with the Nazi Fourth Reich, the Mossad and the South American drug Cartels to traffick massive quantities of illegal drugs into America through Zapata and DEA controlled deliveries into Mena, Arkansas, LA (Freeway Ricky Ross) and every major American city. And the CIA formed a strategic alliance with the NY mafiosi John Gotti to distribute the Mena cocaine. It’s no coincidence that well-informed insiders have referred to the CIA as “Cocaine Importing Agency” for many years. Isn’t it interesting how John Gotti came down with a strange rare case of throat cancer so he couldn’t talk. When the Secret Shadow Government was initially being formed, there were struggles to gain control over the Alien ET/UFO matter between the US Army and the US Navy. After the CIA was created entered the fray, a strained but workable partnership was established allowing each entity to carve out their own areas of control in these matters. It wasn’t long before main responsibilities for back-engineering the recovered UFO technologies was transferred to numerous Defense Contractors which had the specialization and expertise needed. These defense contractors became more and more engulfed in higher and higher levels of secrecy deemed necessary to protect the recovered and developed technologies from other nations, especially the Soviet Union. Soon these Defense Contractors in a sense became independent and unaccountable to the American People and part of a large subterranean (literally and figuratively because of their numerous Deep Underground Bases) Secret Shadow Government, accountable to themselves only with no serious Congressional or Presidential oversight. As the Secret Shadow Government grew larger, more diversified, it also became stronger and more tyrannical toward the American people, setting up massive spying and surveillance systems against war protesters to begin with, then with the advent of the cell phones and Internet against every single America. Soon America became run by the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) as its main controller which either picked and promoted its elected officials. Once elected if not chosen these officials are usually “human compromised” by using sophisticated sexual and pedophile “honey traps” often using alcohol and hypnotic drugs like Rohypnal, Placidyl, Chloral Hydrate, and Scopolomine (Boradinga). The United States has become a nation that has been secretly transformed into a Super-Fascist State. Soon the United States of America became a secretly Fascist nation, best described as a “Super Fascist” nation. Fascism in general is the fusion of the State and the Corporations with the state setting policy and deploying the corporation as its political servant. With Super-Fascism, the corporations become dominant and stack the government with their puppets and thus the Government itself is controlled by a select set of major corporations. In America today we have Super-Fascism but it is a situation where the Corporations which are stacking the USG (the State) and running it just happen to be the very same large and power Defense Contractors that run the Secret Space program, the various spy operations for the CIA and the Contractors that run the Deep Underground military Base network of 140 DUMBs all connected by a high speed maglev railroad. In essence, this Secret Shadow Government had become a sovereign nation unto itself. The original mandate of the CIA was to engage in foreign intelligence, with the FBI’s Division Five handling counter-intelligence inside the USA. This mandate remained the same until the illegal unconstitutional passage of the Patriot Act, which has been used by the CIA as a false mandate to spy on Americans under the guise of protecting national security and stopping terrorism inside America. And now we have the massive leakage of Vault 7 from Wikileaks which has disclosed what is claimed to be a mere 1% of all the secret CIA crimes against We The People. The source of this leak has to track back to the NSA, one way or another. No one else has the technology to have collected and dispersed all these secret methods that have been used to criminally spy on Americans without probable cause and a warrant signed by a judge, not some puppet, backslapping FISA court which is a joke. Who has access to all this NSA data that could be motivated to have leaked this. The answer in that it would have to be some powerful Intel faction and anyone who is part of the Six Eyes System — normally called Five Eyes publicly by the USG, but Israel was secretly brought in, and now has had full access to all NSA raw feeds, so realistically it should be called the Six Eyes System. It well known that numerous powerful factions exist in non-CIA American Intel groups that are sick and tired of the crimes and corruption of the CIA. I will briefly list the most egregious of them here: (Note: these are all major RICO crimes). Do not be surprised if it turns out some inside the CIA have assisted in this major leak, which is just 1% of what is coming. Although candy-coating the facts as much as possible, the CIA Internal Investigation report by Frederick Hitz showed conclusively that at a minimum the CIA looked the other way and “allowed” illegal narcotics to be trafficked in and shared in the profits for covert operations. Hitz resigned as soon as his report was made public. 1- Major illegal drug trafficking into the USA designed to provide lots of off the books black money and to create massive chaos in the US urban areas to destroy society. 2- Setting up, training financing private mercenary armies in foreign lands to start color revolutions, and deploy terrorists, all done to start wars for the Industrial, Banking Defense Complex which need wars to make profits for their 66 major family shareholders. The CIA’s main job today besides drug trafficking is to use creative means to set the stage for starting foreign wars that the Military Industrial Banking Complex needs to generate massive profits for the big 66 families that own the big blocks of their stock. 3- Running massive Mind-kontrol operations inside America by using the Satanic Cult Network as cover and sharing in their Satanic Ritual Abuse, pedophilia, and human sacrifice rituals (the CIA Finders program is but one example, many like this are currently active too). Top Satanic pedophiles and Trauma-based  Mind-Kontrollers are given the status of informants, considered CIA assets and are treated as if they had full diplomatic immunity. The CIA runs these Satanic pedophile ops like the “Finders” and the FBI’s job is to keep them covered up (forever). 4- Deploying advanced highly sophisticated psychotronics and Psyops against the American public without their consent through targeted EMF, ELF, Scalar, Wi-Fi, cell phone towers, Doppler radar, dirty electricity and Lilly Waves. The CIA is responsible for shaping the masses group mind set and psychotronics allows them to directly entrain thought and attitudes into the brains of the American People without them knowing or understanding it. These systems are designed to also dumb-down the masses, keep them tranquilized, cause sleep disorders and many have symptoms like fatigue, fibromyalgia, short term memory problems even in younger folks, ringing in their ears, hot flashes followed by cold flashes with no temperature changes, dental problems, stomach problems, and migraine headaches, EKG and EEG irregularities. 5- Running numerous sophisticated bust-out schemes using infiltrated banks, consumer scams, infiltrated and hijacked corporations, and secret proprietaries to gain access to vast amounts of money needed for their black budget. It is no coincidence that insiders call the CIA the “Company”, since it functions like a greedy, illegal organized-crime enterprise that is oriented to asset-stripping anything it can, using any means to gain vast amounts of black funds. 6- Controlling each and all of the six Major Mass Media (aka the CMMM), which functions as a News and Media Cartel, an illegal monopoly controlled by a secret “News Council” which answers to a large investment firm that claims to be on the vanguard of investments. This large investment firm has two parts, a legitimate part for investors and an illegitimate criminal part used to finance foreign mercenaries and terrorist armies such as ISIS; it financed the tankers ISIS has used to transport stolen crude oil in for Turkey. The CMMM specializes in the use of specially constructed false narratives, big lies and twisted propaganda designed to mislead and mind-kontrol the American masses to love their captivity under the thumb of the CIA and the SSG. The CIA is notorious for running serial mass-murder operations against a single terrorist usually by taking out many innocents with them and then hitting their funerals to murder their families too. These are blatant war crimes, and these terrorists were set up, trained, financed, supplied and mind-kontrolled (radicalized) in the first place by the CIA and the Mossad. A massive, unprecedented CMMM coverup was rolled out to discredit this 100% truthful book which laid out the truth about CIA Treason, Sedition and RICO in spades. Gary Webb was murdered for this and for a new book he was working on, which would have rocked and shocked the world. 7- Assassinating folks who the CIA decides must be “Terminated With Extreme Prejudice”, such as Presidents like JFK and politicians like Robert F. Kennedy, Senator John Tower, Senator Paul Wellstone, public figures like Martin Luther King. The list is a very long one that includes hundreds, some obvious, some completely masked by highly sophisticated means, and some obvious murders classified by crooked, compromised LE as suicides, like Gary Webb supposedly shooting himself twice in the head with a shotgun. Arranging for masked assassinations that look like death from natural causes or suicide (aka “arkencides). Insiders typically refer to such deaths as “CIA Flu”. Naturally the CIA specializes in painting automotive steering wheels with short acting poison mixed in DMSO for good skin penetration or placing short acting, dissolving Cesium radioactive discs close to where targets sit at their office or home or spraying such materials inside the vents of their automobiles or running “Boston Brakes” cyber interfaces with their autos to cause strange accidents like the way they murdered Michael Hastings for writing his last article on why Democrats love spying on the American people. Toyota was a victim of Industrial sabotage by this means with runaway cars and allegedly so has been the recent Samsung battery fires. 8- Forming strategic alliances with organized crime and giving immunity to major Felony offenders in exchange for becoming “informants” and CIA partners in crime. This provides great cover for secret deep black CIA covert operations, good deniability and access to Intel otherwise denied. Like the phrase goes, “if you sleep with dogs, you get fleas”. Well the CIA has become as soulless and dirty as the worst organized crime thugs out there. 9- Setting up lots of special interest political groups, NGOs, fake charities, infiltrating certain churches, infiltrating legitimate political action groups to generate conflict to disjoint them, etc. These actions have been fully disclosed in the past as Operation Chaos and claimed to have been stopped. Actually the name of the operation has been changed and they have expanded into hundreds of sub-programs each working to help implement the Globalist NWO Agenda of the main group at the top of the Pyramid of Power that controls everything, the Babylonian Talmudic private central Banksters run out of the City of London, also known as the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia. More will be disclosed on this important root cause soon in a new series of articles by Preston James and Mike Harris. _________ Conclusion Deep underground levels (file photo) The Vault 7 leak has exposed the CIA massive illegal spying crimes against all Americans and all US Politicians but it is only the tip of the Iceberg of the massive crimes and theft of assets of the Secret Shadow Government. The SSG has become the real, operational USG and transformed the visible USG including Congress, the President, the Administration and Judiciary into a ceremonial government system, designed to fool We The People and make us believe we have a system sensitive to our needs. The fact is the SSG and the CIA itself will only yield control when populism has arisen to the point those in its own ranks rebel and feel 100% supported by We The People and the Military. Consider this. Approximately 985-Billion dollars goes to American Defense and Intel. The actual figure could be as high as one Trillion USD per year. But this figure does not include all the money that is spent on the highly classified Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) or in the deep black and beyond-black Secret Space War Programs. Insiders estimate this to be between 1/2 trillion to one trillion USD total that is secretly spent in space and underground. Thus, this is all “off the books” black budget unsupervised expenditures. Yes this is a lot of money that has been asset stripped from Americans one way or another. If you are wondering why you don’t have the spendable income you used to have and are losing hope for any decent economic future for yourself, your family, and especially children or grandchildren, now you know why. Yes, there are a lot of reasons, like too many immigrants taking our jobs, too many factories exported from so-called Free Trade (a Globalist ploy), and too many illegals on our welfare. Yes, it’s all part of the Globalist agenda that the CIA assists with. But the biggest reason of all is the Secret Shadow Government massive expenditures that require massive stripping of the American taxpayers in hundreds of ways you never ever thought of. Be thankful for the Vault 7 leak, because for once a very powerful faction has decided that the CIA has just gone too far, and the Secret Shadow Government must be exposed and deconstructed piece by piece down to a workable size fully known by and authorized by We The People. Stay tuned because the CIA and the SSG is going to be exposed piece by piece in the months and years to come. As the CIA is fully exposed and deconstructed, hopefully eliminated, the USG must start telling We The People the truth about Alien ETs, crashed and recovered, back-engineered anti-gravity craft and our own Secret Space War program. And it is time that all the new zero point energy technologies be shared too. The time for all these massive official USG lies to stop has come. In short all the massive USG and SSG lies proclaimed by the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) needs to stop. The CIA and its propaganda stooge the CMMM must both be broken into a thousand pieces. The CIA must be prosecuted under RICO, for serving as a tool of foreign espionage inside America (Nazi Fourth Reich, Mossad and City of London Banksters). The CMMM must be broken up under anti-trust laws and the CEO’s who set these editorial policies requiring lies be fully prosecuted for doing espionage against We The People. Their FCC licenses need to be immediately revoked for violating them and not meeting the base requirements to serve the public’s needs. _________ _________   _______________ Related Posts: Secret Space War VIII: Alien Quantum Computing and the End of Secrecy?

A lot to cover because of the interrelational connections. So much, you could write a book, (and how is that going btw?) You can’t really speak about the SSG without the Corporations or SSP or underground bases or the satan worshipping elite because they all tie together. The SSP and SSG are their own sovereign nation! The corporations and their protectors are looting all the resources on Mars and other planets. They gave up on planet earth a long time ago after stashing all gold, minerals and resources from all countries. With the help of the alien technology they exchange for humans, they are so technically advanced now they rarely return to earth. They can be on Mars in minutes. The moon is a shared base. They have a large slave labor force of kidnapped humans on Mars. They were taken mostly from Nepal, Tibet, Finland, Iceland, etc for their ablility to withstand harsh windy weather, which exists on Mars. William Tompkins is the real deal and there are many others ready to come forward.

It is not within the god particle contained within human DNA for one human to easily kill/sacrifice/abuse another. Such actions are implanted. Here are two videos which explain what I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvl-PxSjzf0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BSgE1KyBDg According to Simon Parkes of Connecting Consciousness earth is the firebreak for the parasitic archon virus and humanity is now in a War of Light vs parasitic evil. If we can’t raise ourselves en masse into the Light before September 2017 then we will be plunged further into depravity, A.I. and cyborgs. RFID chips, chemtrails with black goo and vaccinations are just the first steps. For the most part the CIA are alien entities with a few befuddled humans mixed in.

Log in to Reply Leif Oldhart  March 21, 2017 at 11:57 am A question, Preston James: what’s the chance that we are approaching another ice age, as in a real ice age (not the mini-type)? Could that be part of the reason for the underground complexes. As you probably know there have been large underground habitation areas built in the remote past, though not so huge as these that are made possible by the technology you mention. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  March 21, 2017 at 4:55 pm Probably zero chance. Several Intel insiders have claimed that the Earth would be getting hotter and hotter perhaps scorched for a period of months by a large solar flare-out or solar storm. That seems more possible, but if the govt was seriously concerned that Global warming, man caused climate change, or too much carbon being emitted into the air, they would greatly restrict airlines and go to a high sped rail system connected to every major city. Helena M Jordan  March 20, 2017 at 12:32 pm Thank you Preston James. The Secret Space Program is darker than anyone knows or can understand given the science taught in universities. Elena Kapulnik explains what’s happening in her latest video. Human DNA is made up from many aliens races. Human DNA is of enormous value to malevolent self-serving alien races. Hence reason for why so many humans go missing every year. Human DNA is a hugely valuable off-planet export commodity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzTcg9SPes8 Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  March 21, 2017 at 5:03 am An interesting comment. Some including myself believe that there is a God Almighty, creator of all, first cause, the Great I am, and that He created man in his image. As far as what Alien ETs are, there are many different perspectives, but we do know for certain that some of these entities are anti-human and evil. jensingr  March 21, 2017 at 5:49 pm They are definitely after our DNA. Their purpose is two-fold. To use in their underground hybrid creation labs..mixing our DNA with theirs and other robotoid half-humans who will become their slaves. And to collect DNA from individuals who may be connected to the “bloodlines”. Ancestry and other websites were created for the purpose of seeing who is related to “them” and if they can get you to give up your DNA willingly because you are “curious” about where you came from, then they got your DNA with hardly any effort that were given voluntarily which they will keep in the collection vaults.

Thank you, Preston. I can’t wait for the day these thugs face the fire for what they’ve done. I hope it happens within my lifetime. I would be surprised if the world could continue on the same path for more than a decade or so, without humanity becoming extinct. Since governments are PR puppets for their evil paymasters and law enforcement agencies exist to ensure the continuity of their existing tyranny, I wonder who will hold them accountable? It seems we might need a miracle. Thanks again, Preston. RIP Gary Webb.

Amelius  March 21, 2017 at 12:48 am Indeed! Thanks for sharing the excellent news. Rarely do I feel it’s appropriate to celebrate the death of anyone. But in this case, let’s just say I’ll sleep a little easier tonight, knowing one of the most evil and repulsive men of our time is no longer with us. After a lifetime of parasitical scheming to expand his already tremendous fortune and influence, the worms will now crawl through his corpse, the same way they crawl through the corpse of a man who had nothing. Good riddance! Alex B  March 20, 2017 at 11:46 am Michael Hastings: occult code “3 9”,Gary Webb: “2 6”, John Tower: “1 9”=6 1”, Paul Wellstone: “3 9”. Respectively:“Journalist dies in a high-speed car accident” =362/38=390/(-30+11)+11.“Investigative journalist commits suicide by shooting himself TWICE in the head” = 803/68=11+110/(60/(-2+6)+ 11*11) – note “11:11” TWICE as well. “A leading Republican US Senator dies in a plane crash” =444/44= 666/(6*10+6)=(10+9*10+11)/11. “American politician and academic is killed in a plane crash” = 432/50= 6*6*6/300/(9+3). Those are just one point out of dozens of such for each case, present in names, places, dates (where, sometimes, it can be seen even by an “unarmed” eye, like in Gary Webb’s case: 12.10.2004=11*110.(2006-2), etc. Log in to Reply jensingr  March 22, 2017 at 11:11 am wow, I am glad you are keeping track of this…. we all have our expertise! alan colorado  March 20, 2017 at 6:50 am We need more people to lay out the big hidden picture. When presented with the picture the average man cannot totally deny it for it explains the whys and wherefores of everything. It makes all the puzzle pieces fit revealing the big ugly picture for all to see. The scope of the state of affairs is too complex to incessantly be going into each minute detail of each level and debating all the possibilities as so many nitpickers are doing. If only all the public would unite by generally agreeing that there are undeniable crimes, committed by government agencies that must be stopped.These have nothing to do with the ridiculous Republican/Democrat side taking stances which only makes one side right and the other always wrong.

What could be the reason that “the vault” only opens slowly and we are fed fragments of truth instead getting it done and over with ALL deceit right NOW? “We are not ready yet” does sound more like the ones clinging on to control mankind are not ready yet to let go. As long as matters of security have a right to secrecy in any country there never will be any change in direction of freedom, resulting in more fake worldwide conflicts, further humiliation of nations, exploiting of resources, causing chain effect events on Earth which most likely will wipe out much of humanity anyway.

Definitely worth the time, mind blowing stuff… New Linda Moulton Howe Lecture Stunning Alien Binary Code Messages [FULL VIDEO] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTDxz98yKI&feature=youtu.be Log in to Reply MileHighLife  March 19, 2017 at 10:20 am The first part of the lecture in Linda’s video is regarding a very recent event, ongoing in fact, about a high ranking U.S. military official receiving binary code “downloads” (like the 1980 Rendesham Forest binary code incident) that he can’t understand nor explain. The codes play through his mind continuously, only stopping after he records them on paper. Those codes are then sent to one of the few that can decipher them. This downloads are apparently still occurring. Check the vid to see what those codes say….yikes! The rest of the lecture goes places Tompkins has yet to travel, though other high ranking whistle blowers and docs back up. I found Linda’s lecture as fascinating as anything I’ve yet to learn. Interesting times indeed! jensingr  March 21, 2017 at 12:00 am I have seen a few different interviews with the men from Rendesham and each time the binary code message interpretation was different. One time it was a positive message, and another one was very negative. They don’t want anyone to really know….

The ICBM were completely deprogrammed. At other missile sites the ICBMs were mysteriously switched to the ready mode by these visitors. These incidents are not just isolated to the U.S. The Soviet Union also experienced the same incidents. All covered up by the SSG and the media.

By Fora Staff Sunday 19 Mar 2017, 7:10 AM Sun 7:10 AM 17,669 Views 6 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3291231 Share Tweet Email5 Sean Mitchell Image: Vimeo Sean Mitchell Image: Vimeo THE CO-FOUNDER OF Movidius says the decision to sell his company to Intel in a €300 million deal was tough, but a step he felt was right for the business. Chief operating officer Sean Mitchell, who set up the Dublin-based company with David Moloney 10 years ago, also said that the company plans to retain a significant presence in the Irish capital. Speaking at the InterTradeIreland Venture Capital Conference during the week, Mitchell said that he thought that the sale – estimated to be worth at least €300 million - ”was the right one for the stage that we were at”. “Losing the ultimate control is difficult, but I think it is key to have trust that you’re going into a deal that is going to have success.” Speaking to Fora at the event, he added that “there is always that issue of having control over your own destiny and passing that control on”. Movidius is one of the Irish tech industry’s most promising companies, having received about $85 million in investment over several years to develop its microchips, which handle advanced vision-processing duties in various devices. It has signed a string of deals in recent years to supply its technology to major tech-industry players like Google and night-vision equipment designer FLIR Systems. Intel deal It was announced at the start of September that Movidius was to be acquired by Intel, with the Californian chip giant indicating the Irish company’s technology will likely be used to improve its ‘realsense’ platform, which, among other things, is used in advanced 3D cameras. Movidius was loss-making at the time of its sale as it pumped money into its software and hardware development, and nearly went under in 2013 before getting a cash injection. Sean Mitchell (left) and David Moloney Source: Maxwell Photography Mitchell said: “People would love to have the big Irish company that remains independent, (but) there are a lot of dynamics at play. “We were in a position where we had proven the product market fit, the technology and were starting to scale up. If we were to remain independent we would have needed to raise another $50 or $100 million. “We would have had to scale up incredibly aggressively. The market we’re involved in is probably going to end up as winner takes all, there’s not much of a prize for second place.” That meant there would be “many more years” of work and “lots more risks as the competition heated up”, he added. “That was the choice. There was a good deal on the table with a partner who could help us achieve that scale. “A lot of investors in play there, the founders had limited influence (and) it suited people to do that. Losing the ultimate control that’s difficult, it’s definitely an adjustment. “We had a responsibility to the team, all of these people who worked so hard on it, they wanted to see it have an impact. If I didn’t feel that was going to happen through Intel I would have been a lot more concerned about it, but I’m pretty optimistic.” Co-founder Moloney previously said the sale to Intel was “a validation of decades worth of blood, sweat and tears”. Responsibility Mitchell told Fora that the sale marked a “new beginning” for the company. “We’re part of a bigger company, but we’re still building on what we were building before,” he said. Movidius currently has about 80 staff in Dublin and 200 worldwide, a number Mitchell said he could “easily see doubling”. He said that the company is also “hiring a lot” of people in Ireland. Mitchell at the InterTradeIreland event Source: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd While Movidius’s complex share structure means it is difficult to determine how much Mitchell personally gained from the sale, his significant holding meant he stands to make millions. Asked if he was tempted to ‘cash in his chips’ and leave altogether, he said: “When a company spends a large amount of money on an acquisition, they have to make sure that they’re going to get the value from that so they’re very careful that they have a means to retain the team. “Generally speaking, the team don’t get their money out in the way that an investor would. “The choice wouldn’t be there, whether I wanted to or not, it’s going to take years for the proceeds of the sale to flow, but I’m quite happy with that because I have a responsibility to make sure that the transition goes well.” Written by Paul O’Donoghue and posted on Fora.ie Take me to Fora Get the top business news from Fora delivered to your inbox: Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

This disrupts Intel's market in a big way, because AMD is offering performance similar to, or better than the Core i7-6900K, a processor that costs $999.     The latest rumor is that AMD is ready to hit Intel in the HEDT market even harder, offering a new 16C/32T processor for the $1000 mark - beating out Intel's current flagship Core i7-6950X, which costs $1600+. AMD would reportedly unveil this new Ryzen CPU behemoth at Computex, in just two months time - while Intel launches its next-gen X399 chipset and new flagship Core i7 processor. The rumor is floating over from the ChipHell forums, picked up by Overclock3D.net.   According to the rumor: "Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months. You'll see more of it at Computex I believe. It's a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It's akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews. Coming soon".   Great tease, huh? The rumor continues: "CPSs are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps. And if you were hoping for pins, nope it's strictly LGA! It's NOT 8 channel, but Quad. Will be a splendid competition between X299 and this AMD platform. Skylake-X is pretty good, not revolutionary but a meaningful step up in IPC and the clocks are pretty high as well. If Intel will have a 32 core part to compete on X299 remains to be seen, but the HEDT platform is going to change quite a bit in the next 4 to 6 months.?"   I don't think we'll see a revised Ryzen or 'Ryzen 2' processor - but the 16C/32T processor is believable, considering AMD's upcoming Naples CPU will have 32C/64T of pure brute performance - with 128 PCIe 3.0 lanes. AMD could utilize its Naples platform with a HEDT-like Ryzen release with a 16C/32T processor for $999, and a $250-$400 motherboard and really compete with the $2000+ kit from Intel.

Intel may not be quite in the driver’s seat with its deal to buy Mobileye, a tech analyst requesting anonymity told On the Money. The chip giant last week reached a $15 billion deal to buy the Israeli tech company that makes computer vision systems for most carmakers. Intel agreed to pay a relatively high 39 times projected 2018 earnings to reach a deal since Mobileye was not on the market. However, Mobileye could be looking to see if it can get higher offers, the analyst said. The merger agreement has some unusual language. Mobileye, for example, can only take a superior proposal that is 10 percent higher than Intel’s current offer of $63.54. Research firm William Blair in a March 13 report lists Apple, Google and Uber as companies that may have the financial wherewithal and strategic interest to offer a much higher price.

Reuters/Shailesh Andrade If latest reports are to be believed, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could be the fastest hybrid yet from the Redmond tech giant. It is believed to be coming with the all-new AMD Ryzen chip. Moreover, the hybrid will be the right platform to show off the power of Windows 10. The Surface Pro 4 was released back in October 2015. Hence, the next-gen hybrid is due for long. Microsoft is yet to reveal concrete details of the device though. Previously it was being speculated that the device will be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor. Microsoft has long had an incredible working relationship with Intel, and has provided the Core i3, i5 and i7 chips for previous Surface Pro devices. The Kaby Lake chips seemed like a sure thing as it would increase the performance, power and battery life of the hybrid. However, there are whispers that the device-maker may not go with the Kaby Lake architecture and settle for a Ryzen 7 chip from AMD. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 predecessor received raging reviews but was also criticised because of poor battery performance. PC Advisor states that the theory emerged from a trailer of “Alien: Covenant,” which reportedly shows a Surface device. The surprise lies in the description of the YouTube video uploaded by 20th Century Fox. Video has been shared below. “Introducing Walter, the latest synthetic by Weyland-Yutani. Created to serve. Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen and Radeon,” the description reads. It is also possible that the Pro 5 will come in two processor variants, one with the Kaby Lake and the other with the AMD chip. The Ryzen 7 chip has been launched recently, and now it seems it will find a place inside the Surface hybrid. The trailer shows a group of scientists using a device that has amazing similarities to the Surface Pro in build and design. AMD’s logo also appears in the video. There were rumours in February that the device has been leaked on Microsoft’s French website. The image of the product that surfaced online was definitely a Surface product. There is immense anticipation among fans regarding the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 hybrid. It is expected to come in 4K UltraHD display. The screen could be the same 12.3 inches. Other rumoured specs include 16GB RAM, 512GB internal storage, highly-upgraded Surface Pen and wireless charging. While the device is expected in October, Microsoft may surprise fans by releasing it right after the Windows 10 Creators Update in April.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument.

No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Say goodbye to Windows Updates 03/16/2017 at 3:13 PM by Brad Linder 20 Comments Microsoft really wants you to run Windows 10. So while the company continues to offer security updates and bug fixes for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 (and Windows Vista for a few more weeks), the company announced last year that it would not support those operating systems for devices with the latest Intel and AMD chips. Up until now that’s basically just meant that if you were running Windows 8.1 or earlier on a PC with an Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Bristol Ridge or Ryzen processor you wouldn’t get officially supported drivers. But now Microsoft is going a step further: Windows Update won’t work on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 computers with the most recent Intel or AMD chips. Specifically, users attempting to download updates through Windows Update may get a message that says: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. Microsoft says that’s because only it will only support the latest Intel and AMD chips for Windows 10. And that probably won’t be an issue for most users, since most people upgrade their CPU and operating system at the same time: when they buy a new computer. But folks who may build their own computers and prefer Windows 7 to Windows 10 for one reason or another are now in a position where they have to choose between using an older processor or giving up on automatic updates. Or you could just skip Windows altogether and switch to Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or another GNU/Linux operating system. via Hacker News Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 20 Comments on "Have a Kaby Lake/Ryzen CPU and Windows 7 or 8?

That might be true (I don’t use Office to know) but if you buy the full license for a computer you have access to the office suite for life, if you pay a monthly or annual subscription you only have one month or year of full access.

It’s perfectly fine if a Facebook & gaming machine reboots when it chooses to, no value lost, only annoying. But there are places where it’s absolutely unacceptable for a machine to decide to just reboot out of the blue, and Windows 10 is not suited for such places. BTW what is “fake rumor”?

I am not a fan of Windows 10’s insistence on updating immediately (unless you know how to set up the computer to delay a reboot until after the end of the work day) but when I first started using a computer in the late 70’s and early 80’s it was drummed into everyone’s heads to save your work every five minutes. If people did that they wouldn’t lose that much of their document due to lack of incremental saving.

While it might be irritating, it’s becoming much less of an issue all the time as apps and applications move towards autosaving every change you make. It used to be easy to lose your work when an app or the machine crashed (it happened to me more times than I can count) but you have to work quite hard to lose anything these days — especially on a scheduled reboot. Can’t remember the last time I lost anything. Time lost is still a pain, but again, it used to be much worse when it took several minutes just to boot up Windows.

There are screens in the kitchen and the cooks see what dish they need to make, then they press a button below the screen (custom keyboard with 15 keys) and the machine prints a sticker that goes on the box of the dish. The machines are last gen Intel NUCs, and they need to be on 24/7. When a cook comes, they log on the machine with an RFID card. We couldn’t use linux, because both the printer driver and the client program is made for Windows. We ended up using Windows 8.1, and disabled updates, because Windows 10 would reboot the machines and log out the cooks in the process.

I beta tested it and loved it before it actually came out, its a flaming POS now and honestly has broken every computer I have installed it on. I don’t want a version of windows that I have to reinstall multiple times per year, and nevermind the forced updates and bugged drivers that just come break your computer and there is literally nothing you can do about it.

Kontron’s 146 x 102mm “3.5”-SBC-APL” single board computer expands upon the 14nm “Apollo Lake” Atom E3900 series and Celeron N3350 system-on-chips with an SBC focused on security. Other 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBCs include Portwell’s PEB-2773, Advantech’s MIO-5350 and PCM-9366, Litemax’s AECX-APL0, Aaeon’s GENE-APL5, and Avalue’s ECM-APL. 3.5″-SBC-APL (click image to enlarge) The 3.5″-SBC-APL is aimed at industrial production, medical, digital signage, point-of-sale, and point-of-information systems. Linux and Windows, including Windows 10 IoT, are supported. Kontron has previously released a Linux-ready mITX-APL Mini-ITX SBC based on Apollo Lake. The 3.5″-SBC-APL supports up to 8GB of DDR3L, and offers eMMC storage. Kontron’s spec sheet doesn’t say how much, but the block diagram lists a slim 64MB capacity. The 3.5″-SBC-APL has a relatively modest feature set compared to most of the boards listed above. For example, the SATA connection is 2.0 instead of the 3.0, and there are only two coastline USB 3.0 ports. A third USB 3.0 header is noted on the block diagram along with the dual USB 2.0 headers listed in the spec table. 3.5″-SBC-APL block diagram (click image to enlarge) Triple display support is available via DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI ports, as well as a dual-channel LVDS interface, but no resolution is listed. There are also dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and an RS-232/422/485 port, along with serial, GPIO, and audio interfaces. Full- and half-size mini-PCIe slots are available, as well as a SIM card socket for wireless expansion. The 12V, 0 to 60°C ready board is available with active and passive cooling solutions.

View All Posts On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly as investors pounced on bonds and dividend-paying stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, as did the S&P 500. The Nasdaq broke even and the Russell 2000 gained 0.4%. The leading sectors on Friday were utilities (+0.6%), telecom services (+0.6%) and materials (+0.5%). The benchmark 10-year Treasury note’s yield fell to 2.5%. Friday’s volume was higher due to “quadruple witching,” which is the expiration of almost every important class of options. This can cause unusually high volume and volatility but had little impact on Friday’s final numbers. Several economic reports were published on Friday, but the result was that total industrial production is weak, up just 0.3% year-over-year. But the Leading Indicators for February were up 0.6%, and the index is at a decade high. The conclusion is that this year, economic growth should improve. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20 points to 20,915, the S&P 500 lost 3 at 2,378, the Nasdaq was flat at 5,901 and the Russell 2000 gained 5 points to close at 1,392. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 2.3 billion shares with total volume of over 5 billion shares, and the Nasdaq crossed 3 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers outpaced decliners by 1.5-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, advancers led by 1.4-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE increased to 8,966, up from Thursday’s 6,342. The increase was due primarily because of the major options expiration day (quadruple witching). Click to Enlarge Following its high in July 2016, the Dow Jones Utility Average fell over 100 points or 14%-plus. It bottomed in November with hardly a whimper, but began to accumulate buyers in December, the start of what we can now clearly see is a bullish “V” formation. On Friday, buyers chased the attractive yields of this sector, triggering a “Golden Cross” (long-term bullish signal) and setting the stage for an attack on the July 2016 high at over 723. Conclusion: The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to gradually raise rates is not leading the market, but trailing it. The bond markets show similar accumulation. This upward move by higher-yielding investments is a prediction that barring an unforeseen event, the Fed will continue to raise rates. Thus, stock buyers should focus on securities whose management plans to increase dividends and stock buy-back plans, like our Trade of the Day, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). It is those stocks that, along with a strong growth record, will most likely lead the market this year. Today’s Trading Landscape To see a list of the companies reporting earnings today, click here.

Following a series of tweets about that appeared intended to try and change the topic away from wiretapping, Trump is on to a new topic: polls. It’s unclear what specific polls Trump is talking about but the one that must be most galling to him this morning is the Gallup poll that shows his approval rating at a record low. UPI reports: The Gallup daily poll, based on a three-day rolling average released Saturday, shows 37 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 58 percent disapprove. On Jan. 22, three days after Trump was sworn into office, Trump’s approval and disapproval rating was split 45 percent to 45 percent, respectively. On Feb. 21, about halfway through his first three months in office, 42 percent of Americans approved of Trump, while 52 percent disapproved, Gallup polls show. Though Trump’s approval rating reached a new low Monday, it has been among its highest levels since the beginning of March. On March 10, Trump’s approval was at 45 percent, 1 point shy of his high of 46 percent immediately after his inauguration. That number has since plummeted amid the fallout and subsequent investigation of comments he made accusing former President Barack Obama of tapping Trump’s phones at Trump Tower. Tweeted Trump: “Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox.” Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 In other news, the Liar in Chief claimed he had a full weekend meetings until alternate evidence emerged: photos revealing that he actually had a big golf weekend.

Video - House Intel Chairman David Nunes: Hard To Believe Gulen Behind Turkey Coup.(GP) The United State House Intelligence Committee chairman has said it is “hard to believe” that U.S.-based Turkish cleric is behind the military coup attempt last summer, questioning Turkey as a reliable ally. “I find that hard to believe,” David Nunes told Chris Wallace from Fox News when asked if cleric Fethullah Gulen is the architect of the coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mr. Nunes added that the government of Mr. Erdogan is becoming very authoritarian and that Ankara, as a NATO ally, is “becoming more and more worrisome in terms of actually being a reliable ally.”Read the full story here.

Fortune Magazine, March 13th Advertisement It is hard to overstate the significance of the deal; the $1 billion sale of Israeli company Waze to Google in 2013 was considered a landmark moment, but that now looks like small fry compared to the Mobileye sale. As venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg wrote, this deal changes expectations and raises the bar, as Israeli entrepreneurs “now know they can build a $15 billion company in ten years.” Israel’s GDP is around $320 billion, so for two Israelis to create a company worth $15 billion, 5% of the country’s GDP, in just ten years, is simply staggering. This very significant story was not reported in the Guardian. This in and of itself is a little surprising, but not malicious or improper. What makes it noteworthy is that the pages of the Guardian feature much discussion and reporting about BDS, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement – but one wonders whether they are missing the real story. “Brian Eno refuses to let Israeli dance company use his music,” read a Guardian headline in September 2016. Is the decision of one British producer, with negligible economic impact, a more significant story than the multibillion dollar sale of the leading automotive technology company to the world’s largest chip producer? The Guardian features articles on Israel’s actions to counter the BDS movement, articles celebrating BDS successes, as well as opinion pieces discussing the merits and shortcomings of the movement. Is BDS the real story? Surely the real stories of Israel’s economy are the technology start-ups revolutionising every sector, from medical treatment to the “gig economy”, to cybersecurity. Staying up to date with the latest Israeli successes (were the Guardian to be interested in it) would actually be dizzying. One can find successes at every turn – this past September, Payoneer, an Israeli company revolutionising online payments raised $180 million in their latest funding round. In July 2016, a Chinese company bought Playtika, an Israeli gaming company, for $4.4 billion. In the chip-making sector, Mellanox bought Israeli company EZChip in February 2016 for $811 million. As Israeli technologies continue to have a growing impact on all our lives, the Guardian’s myopic focus on the BDS movement becomes almost comical. Guardian journalists drive to work with the help of Israeli route-navigating technology (and soon in cars automated by Israeli technology), sit down to computers powered by Israeli designed chips, write articles they back up on Israeli invented flash drives, or on the cloud, and are increasingly protected by Israeli cybersecurity – but produce article after article about the “success” of BDS. Israel will keep improving the lives of literally billions of people around the world, whether the Guardian covers it or not. But the pages of the Guardian are missing the real story; maybe they should check out some of the Israeli start-ups trying to improve the world of journalism, for some help.   Advertisement SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleThe Lifeguard Tower Hotel Next articleLinda Sarsour and the Interfaith Dialogue Fallacy CAMERA CAMERA, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, is the foremost media-monitoring, research and membership organization promoting accurate, balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East.

By Sarmistha Acharya March 20, 2017 12:44 GMT Microsoft recommends upgrade to Windows 10 Microsoft Technology giant Microsoft is blocking Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on Intel's seventh generation Core i3, i5 and i7 AMD's seventh generation processor (Bristol Ridge) and Qualcomm's 8996 processors. While trying to scan and download updates through Windows Update, error messages appear saying, "Windows could not search for new updates" and "code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error." As explained in Microsoft Knowledge based article the errors occur as the new processor generations require the latest Windows version. For those on Windows 7 and 8.1, Microsoft recommends updating the devices to Windows 10. In response to the matter a Microsoft spokesperson told the Forbes, "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon". From July onward the Intel Skylake processors will not support Windows 7 and 8, which means users will need to update to the latest operating system in order to receive further updates. However, Microsoft did not reveal how much it would charge users of Windows 7 and 8.1 devices after the free Windows update period gets over. But users can use Windows 7 and 8.1 product keys for Windows 10 installation. Last June Microsoft had assured users auto updates for Windows 10 will be easier to reject and not forced upon them after receiving complaints regarding the same.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation House Hearings On Russia, Wiretapping Set To Begin Today Share on Facebook Share on Twitter House Hearings On Russia, Wiretapping Set To Begin Today Posted at 8:45 am on March 20, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Buckle up. As the House Intel Committee hearings kick off today, the first few minutes could focus on President Trump’s claims that Trump Tower was wiretapped by former President Obama. FBI Director James Comey is expected to address the issue of wiretapping in the opening minutes, and his testimony is expected to contradict everything Trump has claimed.  Comey’s expected comments to the House Intelligence Committee will mark the U.S. law enforcement community’s first public response to President Donald Trump‘s continuing insistence that the Obama administration “wiretapped” or otherwise conducted surveillance of Trump’s presidential campaign. National Security Agency director Mike Rogers will also be testifying. “It never hurts to say you’re sorry,” a Republican member of the committee, former CIA officer William Hurd, R-Texas, advised Trump today, telling ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos that the commander-in-chief should apologize for his false statements, which have angered key allies such as Great Britain. The main purpose of the hearing is to determine if Russia did, in fact, interfere in the 2016 election, and to determine if any U.S. citizens helped them. Any actual collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia may be hard to determine. Trending Lying Democrats Gather on Capitol Steps to Celebrate 7th Anniversary of Obamacare Disaster Jim Jamitis There is apparently lots of smoke, but no actual fire has been discovered. But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, the chairman of the committee -– one of several congressional committees looking into allegations of Russian meddling in the election -– insisted he has seen “no evidence of collusion” between Trump associates and the Russian government, noting that the only direct evidence of a crime he’s seen is the leaking of classified U.S. intelligence to reporters, including information about Flynn’s pre-inauguration contacts with Russian diplomat Sergey Kislyak. The Washington Post first revealed that, despite Flynn’s private denials, he had discussed Obama administration sanctions against Russia with Kislyak — a discussion captured by U.S. spy agencies eavesdropping on Kislyak. The Washington Post later revealed that now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had also met with Kislyak at least twice during the campaign. Sessions’ meetings were more in line with the course of work. Flynn’s contact may have been a bit more troublesome, especially in light of the fact that he misrepresented the nature of his conversations with Kislyak to Vice President Pence, and was subsequently forced to step down. Comey’s testimony will probably be limited on the subject of Russia to explaining why Russia would try and influence a U.S. election, as well as how they carry out the same campaign of confusion and interference in Europe, but there is a lot of anticipation that he will put the lid on any more questions, regarding the alleged surveillance of Trump. I’m looking for a swipe at WikiLeaks, myself. There are many who believe WikiLeaks is a tool for the Kremlin, even though founder Julian Assange denies it. Keep denying it, but it’s curious that your main (only?) target seems to be the U.S. and you leave nations like Russia and China alone. The hearings are expected to begin at 9am today.     Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: James Comey Obama Wiretapping Russia Recent Stories ‘There Is No Plan B’: The House Votes Today on AHCA Caleb Howe 4 Reasons Devin Nunes’s Stunt Created More of A Mess Jay Caruso Pastor Tim Keller Too Conservative for Religious Award, Princeton Rescinds Kira Davis COMMENTS POSTING RULES  |  LOGIN TO COMMENT  |  REGISTER TODAY Trending 4 Reasons Devin Nunes's Stunt Created More of A Mess City of Boston and Hospital Violated Teen Girl's Human Rights, Hacker Who Fought for Her Faces 25 Years in Prison 'There Is No Plan B': The House Votes Today on AHCA CNN: Trump Folks May Have Possibly Coordinated with Russia, Sources Might Say.

READ STUDIES Computing on The Edge – Mobile Data Centers March 20, 2017March 20, 2017 by Josh Hamilton 52shares Computing on The Edge Every single day more and more data is produced, exchanged, processed, and transmitted around the world. The sheer amount of data processed every day is growing exponentially and by 2020 Intel has estimated that the average internet user will being consuming 1.5GB of traffic every 24 hours, while daily video traffic will have reached a staggering 1PB (1 Petabyte = 1000 Terabytes). The booming expansion of IoT devices, such as smart home technology and autonomous cars, is the driving force behind this monstrous growth prediction, with more and more data being collected and processed by every single device we purchase. When combined with the prospect of 5G technology and super-fast worldwide connections, data centers are already starting to groan at the thought of the massive strains that are likely to be placed on their processing capacity. And while data centres have already begun to upgrade to prepare for the onslaught of data and analytics, there is a new type of processing on everyone’s lips – Edge Computing. The idea sounds relatively simple, it is a distributed information technology architecture that allows client data to be processed at the “edge” of the network, as close to the source as possible. By utilizing the processing of intermediary and periphery servers, mobile services can get faster responses without putting stress on core network servers. Time-sensitive data can be processed at locally based intermediary servers, while data that is less time-sensitive can be sent to the cloud for big data analytics and long term storage. Sending massive amounts of raw data over a network can put huge strains on the network resources, so it does make sense to process data closer to its source rather than transmit it to a data centre and then back again. There have also been suggestions that smart devices could be designed to only transmit relevant data to further reduce the strain on networks as the volume of data increases over the next decade. For example, autonomous vehicles could monitor the oil level, or brake fluids, and then only transmit that data when the levels fall outside pre-set limit. Similarly, a Wi-Fi security camera could use edge analytics and only transmit data when a certain percentage of pixels change between frames. As IoT devices grow in processing power, each device could effectively become a mini data center. A self-driving car, which could well house up to and above 200 CPUs, “that’s a data center on wheels” commented venture capitalist Peter Levine at the Wall Street Journal’s CIO Network event in San Francisco earlier this month. He believes that a self-driving car will simply have too much data for it to be practical to constantly send it out to the cloud and back – especially since a self-driving car will need the data immediately! Then consider the vast field of other intelligent devices that will also be trying to use the cloud: “You will never have enough bandwidth and speed on the network between for that,” Levine declared. So each devices will deal with all of their own processing and storage, and send any relevant data to the cloud, which becomes like the brain for the system – analysing all the data and sending back what it learns to all the devices. So all the devices are able to learn not just from themselves, but from each other. “I can’t imagine there will ever not be a place for cloud computing,” Diana McKenzie, the CIO of Workday, told CIO.com. She envisions a future where cloud and edge computing work in tandem, complementing one another. Edge computing is likely to reduce the work that the cloud does at the moment, processing data for individual devices, and allow it to focus on big data analytics from fields of devices. The concept of edge computing is one that has become increasingly viable because of the sheer number of IoT devices being produced, the endlessly falling costs of computer components, and the advent of mobile computing. However, while there are numerous benefits to be had with using edge computing, there are several trade-offs that come along with the technology. It can reduce response time to mere milliseconds, as well as combat network latency and bottlenecks, but there are serious concerns regarding network security and licensing that need to be addressed before edge computing can be considered totally viable.

However, with the offer to purchase Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) at $63.54 per share and INTC’s decline to the mid-$30s, INTC’s high number of stock holders makes it attractive for another review. Despite “periods of lumpiness,” higher cloud investments, growth within “the Internet of Things” and increased demand for more powerful memory chips should benefit Intel. The company’s recent agreement to purchase MBLY, a leader in the research and development of advanced driver assistance systems, should help Intel cut prices while offering superior autonomous driving platforms. Standard & Poor’s anticipates that Intel’s cash flow will accelerate, which will enable it to raise its dividend and repurchase shares. The target for INTC is $41 and is based on a multiple of 13.9X 2018 EPS estimate of $2.94, up from EPS of $2.80 est. for 2017. INTC’s current dividend is $1.04, providing an annualized dividend yield of 2.95%. For the last year, INTC’s stock has advanced along a bullish support line. In November 2016 that line began to run coincident with the stock’s 200-day moving average. As noted above, the stock “double-topped” at about $38 in January and fell below the support line last week. However, on Wednesday it reversed up, with a CBR buy signal from my internal proprietary indicator. However, in order to confirm the reversal, it must regain the 200-day moving average now at $35.41. Thus, buy INTC at about $35 with a trading target of $41. A stop-loss order should be placed under the “CBR Buy” at $34.60. Click to Enlarge Tell us what you think about this article!

The Good The Dell XPS 15 has a beautiful, high-resolution and accurate broad-gamut display, and it incorporates the Nvidia GTX 1050 gaming GPU, which raises playtime performance in general-purpose laptops. The Bad The webcam is in a terrible location at the bottom of the display and the fan can get loud. The Bottom Line Powerful with a great screen, the Dell XPS 15 delivers solid gaming and affordable mobile workstation-class performance in a relatively compact package. 8.4 Overall Design 8.0 Features 9.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 8.0 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Dell XPS 15 (2017) Dell took what was arguably a best-in-class 15-inch Windows notebook and made it even better. It retains the line's terrific screen, premium build, svelte design and full feature set, boosting it for 2017 with the latest processors from Intel and Nvidia. It's more traditional and certainly a lot more staid than multipurpose hybrids models such as the HP Spectre x360, but it makes up for that with the power and features you can't really cram into a hybrid. I also think it eclipses the current (2016) MacBook Pro in most respects, including using it for photo and graphics work as well as gaming. If the choice is between the Mac's only standout features -- the clever Touch Bar and almost absurdly large touchpad -- and the Dell's far better features, specs and price, I'll take the Dell any time. Those features include a 4K touchscreen display with hardware calibration support, 100 percent Adobe RGB and most of the DCI-P3 coverage and excellent accuracy. Also included is a decent complement of connectors, an SD card reader and much stronger specs -- all for less money than the MacBook Pro. While it's a little bigger and heavier than the MacBook Pro, it's not so in any significant way. A bigger tradeoff is battery life, but that's a price you pay for more powerful components. And yes, the XPS runs Windows while the MacBook runs MacOS, but I'm not wedded to any particular operating system, though. While the 7th-generation Core processor probably contributes to better battery life, the real silicon standout for this model is the Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processor. The 1050 is the lowest-end option in Nvidia's current notebook-processor line, incorporating its latest Pascal architecture. In addition to giving the system pretty solid gaming performance, Pascal has improved battery optimization over its predecessor. That's a huge boon for people who work in photo editing, design, 3D, video and other creative applications which use GPU acceleration, as well as the obvious gamers. While it's not as powerful as the last-generation, top-of-the-line 980M, those were generally used in gaming-specific systems. This class of notebooks usually used the 960M, and it's an improvement over that. However, the 1050 is also the only processor in the line that's not VR ready. And while the chip supports G-Sync, the XPS 15 doesn't seem to. I didn't notice any tearing (horizontal distortion across the screen when playing a PC game), though I believe it's already optimized internally for the laptop display. And I doubt G-Sync kicks in when connected to an external monitor, because the 1050 seems to communicate via the integrated graphics processor and G-Sync requires direct communication between the display as well as the chip. (If you disable the integrated chip, the Nvidia control panel claims it doesn't see the GPU, so you can't turn it on.) Penny wise The system seems quite expensive until you start thinking about what you're getting for the money, although the cheapest model looks like an exception. This year's crop of XPS 15 models incorporate 7th-generation Core i3, i5 or i7 processors. The entry model, a dual-core i3 with an HD (1,920 by 1,080-pixel) nontouch screen only comes with integrated graphics and starts at $999, It looks like a US-only option; in the UK you have a choice of Core i5 or or i7, and in Australia, only i7. If you don't need the wider color gamut and accuracy of the XPS' display or care about the speed boost of an SSD, you might as well go cheaper and get the more flexible Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 instead. It's slightly bigger and heavier, but it's a better value for the money. Once you start looking at models with the 1050 GPU, prices run from $1,250 (£1,350 or AU$2,500) to $2,550 (£1,800 or AU$3,700); if you want the 4K UHD display, you'll pay at least $1,650 in the US, £1,800 in the UK or AU$3,000 (Dell's Australia website is offering a further AU$450 off the 4K model as of this publication time). All of the 4K models incorporate a bigger 97Wh battery (compared to the standard 56Wh), which makes them about 0.5 pound/1.8 kilogram heavier -- our unit with the 4K display and 97Wh battery weighs 4.5 lbs/2kg. Dell doesn't offer a touch version of the HD display for the XPS 15, though, so you're out of luck if that's what you want. Dell XPS 15 (2017) Price as reviewed $2,075, £1,800, AU$3,000 Display size/resolution 15.6-inch, 3,840x2,160-pixel touch display PC CPU 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ PC Memory 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 2,400MHz Graphics 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Storage 512GB SSD Networking 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 Operating system Microsoft Windows 10 Home (64-bit) I think the cheapest configuration I'd recommend is the $1,450 (£1,430, AU$2,500) Core i7 with the HD display because of the combination of features and performance. Though if you're looking for the smallest and lightest performance Windows model in the 15-inch class, the XPS 15 is it for comparable configurations. With 4K, I think our $2,075 (£1,800, AU$3,000) test setup really is a sweet-spot model -- and it's a lot cheaper than the most closely configured MacBook, with a Radeon Pro 460 upgrade, at $2,900 (£2,790, AU$4,410).

The chip maker has unveiled the Optane SSD DC P4800X, a drive destined for the PCI Express or NVMe slots in servers. It only has 375GB of space, but its extremely low latency (typically under 10µs) and 2GB/s throughput means that it can serve as either a memory cache or storage. If you're involved in high-performance computing, online shopping or other categories obsessed with gobs of RAM and rapid turnaround times, this is theoretically your dream device. Intel also promises higher endurance than your typical SSD. The inaugural Optane model can withstand stresses normally associated with RAM, writing about 12.3 petabytes of data in its lifespan. You can get the drive right now if you're part of Intel's early shipping program, and there are promises of larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors coming later in 2017. Not that you're going to drop any of them into your gaming rig any time soon. The 375GB version costs a hefty $1,520 -- even if you could realistically buy one for home use, you'd get far more value out of a high-capacity conventional SSD. Optane won't be viable for mainstream PCs (outside of tiny capacities) until prices fall much, much lower.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor Rumor: AMD Working on 16 Core/32 Thread Ryzen CPU To Take The Performance Crown In The HEDT Spectrum By Usman Pirzada Mar 18, 2017 74Shares Share Tweet Submit A rumor has wafted up from the murky plains of Chiphell’s less reliable forums (via Overclock3d) and claims that AMD is working on a 16-core/32-thread CPU based on the Zen architecture. We already know of the Naples chip but that is part of AMD’s server spectrum and if there really is a 16 core chip in the commercial spectrum then it would be branded as a Ryzen part. AMD is allegedly working on a monstrous 16 Core/32 Thread Ryzen processor Here is a copy of the quote copied vis a vis from Overclockers: Related AMD Ryzen 5 Mainstream Processors Confirmed For April 11th Launch – 6 Core Ryzen 5 1600X To Cost $249, 4 Core Ryzen 5 1500X To Cost $189 Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months. You’ll see more of it at Computex I believe. It’s a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It’s akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews. Coming soon. CPSs are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps. And if you were hoping for pins, nope it’s strictly LGA! It’s NOT 8 channel, but Quad. Advertisement Will be a splendid competition between X299 and this AMD platform. Skylake-X is pretty good, not revolutionary but a meaningful step up in IPC and the clocks are pretty high as well. If Intel will have a 32 core part to compete on X299 remains to be seen, but the HEDT platform is going to change quite a bit in the next 4 to 6 months.? The Naples chip of course has been spotted multiple times on Zauba’s shipping database. The Summit Ridge platform is AMD’s mainstream platform with Zen architecture and 8 core dies. Naples on the other hand is the codename of the server platform; the very same platform which will be rocking Zen in 32 core flavors. This is not to be confused with the Zeppelin platform which will include a 32 Zen core/Vega based APU as well. The 32 Zen cores are tied together using AMD’s very own Coherent Fabric. The homegrown interconnect will support data rates of upto 100GB/s which is a lot faster than what the PCIe interface sustains (around 15GB/s). Not only that but latency has been reduced from 500ns to an unknown but allegedly smaller number. Related AMD Pinnacle Ridge CPUs and Raven Ridge APUs Detailed – High-Performance Pinnacle Ridge To Feature 8 Zen 2 Cores, Raven Ridge Comes With 4 Zen and 11 Vega GPU Cores Thanks to AMD’s lego-like build philosophy even Naples will actually be fabricated in an 8 core base design, with 16 and 32 core chips being produced in an MCM (Multi Chip Module) format. Up till now however, we had seen no real evidence (apart from the usual documentation) that such a monster processor was actually on the charts in the near future. The shipping entry was marked 20th June 2016 and lists the Naples Test Board. It is marked FOC which I assume stands for ‘Full Operational Capability’ meaning AMD has achieved this significant milestone in its Zen roadmap quite some time ago. Here’s the thing though, this very same lego-like build philosophy can allow AMD to roll out a 16 core variant in the commercial space as well, since both utilize the same socket, it really shouldn’t be an issue at all. In fact, yield theory dictates that AMD can roll out any number of cores from harvested dies from failed Naples chips (this includes 10 core, 12 core and yes even 16 core chips). Interestingly however, the rumor says that such an SKU might be based on the LGA socket – that would increase the difficulty of porting and conflicts with AMD’s current philosophy and is the one thing that makes me doubt the authenticity of this rumor. That is to say that AMD can easily roll out a 16 core Ryzen processor but its not going to be based on LGA – for that to happen, it will need to revamp everything from scratch and create a new socket (which this rumor dubs as the X399 socket).

We already knew that Microsoft and its hardware partners — namely Intel and AMD — will not provide official support for the newest generation of PC processors on operating systems released prior to Windows 10. “To achieve the highest confidence in the performance of our AMD Ryzen desktop processors, AMD validated them across two different OS generations, Windows 7 and 10,” said AMD with respect to Ryzen support. “However, only support and drivers for Windows 10 will be provided in AMD Ryzen desktop processor production parts.” Intel’s stance on the matter pretty much mirrors AMD’s comments. Microsoft is taking the drastic step of shutting down ALL access to Windows Update for Ryzen and Kaby Lake processors running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. This isn’t a matter of just missing out on driver updates to fully support the latest generation of processors on older operating systems — we’re talking about a complete blackout of Windows Update on all fronts.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    Intel Committee Chair: ‘No Evidence’ Of Collusion Between Trump Campaign And Russians Alex Pfeiffer Reporter 6:51 PM 03/19/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5540850 House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes said Sunday that there is “no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the presidential campaign. Nunes’ committee is investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, as well as leaks from the intelligence community. The California Republican told Fox News’ Chris Wallace that the only crime there is evidence for is the leaking of the names of Americans who were caught up in surveillance, such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Nunes maintained that he has yet to see evidence of collusion between “Trump world” and the Russian government. His committee is holding its first hearing on the matter on Monday. The House Intelligence Committee chairman seemed to tell Wallace that there is an investigation or surveillance currently being conducted on a member of the White House. “If you look at the folks who are working at the White House today that are involved in the Trump administration, I don’t think there is any but one there that is under any type of investigation or surveillance activities at all,” Nunes said.  A spokesman for Nunes told TheDC the congressman didn’t mean to say this. “It’s a bit garbled in the video but he didn’t mean to say there is one person under surveillance, he’s saying there is no one under surveillance, which is why he says ‘at all’ at the end of the sentence,” the spokesman said.   Tags: Devin Nunes, Donald Trump Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Scott Applewhite, File) By MICHELE SALCEDO / The Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – The top two lawmakers on the House intelligence committee said Sunday that documents the Justice Department and FBI delivered late last week offered no evidence that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, but the panel’s ranking Democrat says the material offers circumstantial evidence that American citizens colluded with Russians in Moscow’s efforts to interfere in the presidential election. “There was circumstantial evidence of collusion; there is direct evidence, I think, of deception,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said. “There’s certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation.” The House intelligence committee is to begin hearings Monday into Russia’s role in cybersecurity breaches at the Democratic National Committee, as well as President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor had authorized a wiretap of Trump Tower. FBI Director James Comey and Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, are slated to testify. Intelligence officials have said that Russia was behind the theft of Democratic National Committee emails last summer. The U.S. government later concluded that the Russian government directed the DNC hack in an attempt to influence the outcome of November’s presidential election. “For the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses,” committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said. “We know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They’re also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and over in Europe.” Nunes said the committee will also examine whether the Russians were trying to sow doubt in the U.S. electoral system or whether they were trying to help Trump get elected to the White House. “We need to get to the bottom of that,” Nunes said. Nunes and Schiff were among a number of lawmakers who said on Sunday’s news shows they had seen no evidence that the Obama administration ordered wiretaps on Trump during the campaign. “Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No there never was,” Nunes said. “The information we received Friday continues to lead us in that direction.” Nunes added: “There was no FISA warrant I am aware of to tap Trump Tower.” FISA stands for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires investigators to seek a warrant from a secret court to wiretap a foreign suspect. Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Susan Collins of Maine also said Sunday they had seen no evidence that the Obama administration had placed Trump under surveillance at Trump Tower, the Manhattan high-rise that houses Trump’s residence, business office and campaign office. Collins encouraged Trump to turn whatever evidence he has of the surveillance over to the congressional intelligence panels looking into the matter. The president repeatedly insisted last week that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower put under surveillance late last fall. Trump’s claims widened to two of the U.S.’s staunchest allies. He repeated an unsubstantiated claim that Britain’s cyber intelligence organization conducted the surveillance at Obama’s behest, a claim the agency GBHQ flatly denied; and mentioned during German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first visit to the Trump White House the Obama administration’s monitoring of Merkel’s cellphone, a bruising incident in German-U.S. relations. “What the president said was just patently false,” Schiff said of the Trump Tower allegations, “and the wrecking ball it created has now banged into our British allies and our German allies and continuing to grow in terms of damage. And he needs to put an end to this.” Nunes spoke on “Fox News Sunday;” Schiff and Collins appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press;” Cotton was on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Fire damages Huntington Beach apartment building, leaves 4 pets dead Shooting in Garden Grove leaves 1 man injured In London, another ‘lone wolf’ terrorist attack Where do Southern California Republicans stand on GOP health care bill? 7 of 9 puppies taken from Cypress woman accused of running bogus rescue are adopted User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

As it turns out, Bluetooth is named after a 10th-century Scandinavian king. Harald "Blåtand" Gormsson was a viking king who ruled Denmark and Norway from the year 958 until 985. There are many accomplishments credited to him, but greatest of all is that he united Denmark and Norway under his rule. Gormsson was also known for his dead tooth, which had a very dark blue/grey shade. It was so prominent that his nickname was Blåtand, which literally translates from Danish to "Bluetooth."  But what could this possibly have to do a wireless technology that lets you use a hands-free headset while you drive?  Fast-forward a little over 1,000 years to 1996, and short-range radio technology was in its very early stages — Intel had a program called Biz-RF, the Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson had MC-Link, and Nokia had Low Power RF. The three powerhouses quickly recognized that the best way to drive the technology forward within the industry and avoid fragmentation would be to create a single wireless standard.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc King Bluetooth In December of that year, representatives from each group met at the Ericsson plant in Lund, Sweden to plan their industry-standard technology. Before they could get started, however, they decided that they needed a codename for the project while it was in development. Intel representative Jim Kardash suggested that the temporary name be "Bluetooth," and his reasoning was simple.  "King Harald Bluetooth ... was famous for uniting Scandinavia just as we intended to unite the PC and cellular industries with a short-range wireless link," he wrote in a blog post.  Later on, when the technology was nearly finalized and it was time to choose a permanent name, Kardash explained that Bluetooth wasn't even in the running. The two top contenders were RadioWire (the Intel proposal) and PAN (for Personal Area Networking, the IBM proposal). In April we held our board meeting and voted for the official name which went to PAN in a 4-1 vote. At this point everybody started using the name PAN and we were driving towards the launch event which would occur in about four weeks. About a week later, an emergency meeting was called. The other member companies had performed a trademark search on the word PAN and surmised that this would be a poor candidate for a trademark: an internet search produced tens of thousands of hits. It turned out that no trademark search was done on the backup name (Radio Wire) and the only name we could go to launch with on short notice was Bluetooth! © Provided by Business Insider Inc Bluetooth rune Somehow, the Bluetooth origin story doesn't end there. Once the technology had an official name, it also needed a logo.  "But isn't the Bluetooth logo just a 'B' written in a tacky '90s font?" I imagine you're asking right now. No, it's not.  That "B" logo is actually ol' King Blåtand's initials written in ancient Danish runes. So, there you have it. Bluetooth is called Bluetooth because its developers were big history nerds and they couldn't come up with a better idea.  Who knew?

Sure, you’ll find deals from Apple occasionally, but there’s not much movement on product prices. Consumers often turn to eBay, Craiglist, and other alternative routes to find deals on Apple products, but these purchases can be unpredictable. Instead or trying your luck, it may be better to stick with authorized retailers such as Best Buy, which currently has 12 standout deals on top Apple products.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press today and told host Chuck Todd that there was a lot of information when it comes to cooperation between the Russian government and Trump campaign. With FBI Director James Comey scheduled to speak at a Congressional hearing on Russian election interference tomorrow, Schiff — the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee — was asked about former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper saying there’s no evidence of collusion and if there will be “fire to go with all of this smoke.” Schiff said he was surprised by Clapper’s comments, and then mentioned that there may be some fire. “There is circumstantial evidence of collusion,” the California lawmaker stated. “There is direct evidence, I think, of deception, and that’s where we begin the investigation.” He continued, “Now I don’t want to prejudge where we ultimately end up, and of course, there’s one thing to say there’s evidence, there’s another thing to say we can prove this, or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, or there’s enough evidence to bring to a grand jury for purposes of criminal indictment. But there is certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation.” Todd also brought up how the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that former Trump advisor Roger Stone preserve all Russian-related communication and documentation and wanted to know if the House Intel Committee had done the same. Schiff explained that they asked the U.S. government but hadn’t sent letters to individuals yet. Watch the clip above, via NBC News.

EVGA SC17 1070 laptop orders up 4K and G-Sync to go by Wayne Manion  4:00 PM on March 17, 2017 Just yesterday, we reported on an AOC monitor with 4K resolution and support for Nvidia's G-Sync. If cramming 3840x2160 pixels and Nvidia's variable refresh rate technology into a 27" panel isn't impressive enough for you, perhaps the pixel density in the 17" 4K G-Sync display in EVGA's SC17 1070 gaming laptop will be satisfactory. The mobile gaming station packs an Intel sixth-generation Core i7-6820HK CPU, a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, and 32 GB of system memory to go with that UHD panel. Laptops in the 17" class are never compact, but the SC17 justifies its size by bringing a lot of hardware along for the ride. The system boots from a 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD, but also carries a 2.5" HDD for 1TB of additional storage. The keyboard is a full-sized affair with a number pad and white LED backlighting. If the built-in 4K display isn't enough, the machine has an HDMI 2.0 jack and a pair of mini DisplayPort connectors. The Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi controllers are both Intel units. The laptop packs a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. EVGA is quite proud of the tweaking features built into the SC17 1070, claiming that the machine has a "full BIOS" implementation with overclocking capabilities. When those overclocking experiments go awry, a hardware CMOS clear button should make it easy for the user to put things back to factory settings. The manufacturer says the SC17 1070 is bloatware-free, a claim that saddens me that it has to be mentioned at all. The EVGA SC17 1070 is available now in the company's online store for $2550. For the time being, that price also includes an EVGA Torq X10 gaming mouse and a backpack that hopefully can swallow up the machine's 16.1" x 11.6" x 1.1" (41 cm x 30 cm x 2.7 cm) dimensions and 9 lb (4.1 kg) bulk.

By Chris Duckett | March 19, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Hardware (Image: Intel) Intel has taken the wraps off its first Optane 3D XPoint storage product, the SSD DC P4800X, which the company claims can make database transactions up to 10 times faster. Optane will first be available from today to select early customers as a 375GB add-in card, and during the second half of the year will also be available in 750GB, 1.5TB sized cards, and as U.2 drives. Your social data is doomed, and don't count on Facebook to save you Your status updates, your uploaded photos, your videos, all of it is going to be inaccessible sometime in the future. Not just by you, but by your descendants as well. Read More Beyond its speed as a standard SSD replacement -- which the chip giant said is between 8 to 40 times more responsive under load compared to a SSD DC P3700 -- Intel is touting its usage as a memory extender. Coupled with Memory Drive found on Xeon chips, an Optane SSD is able to be used in a memory pool along with DRAM without needing to adjust the OS or any applications. For select workloads, the company said it believes as much as 90 percent of DRAM can be replaced with Optane SSDs. In an example the company showed off, it took a dual-Xeon server with 678GB of RAM that was handling a 675GB MySQL database, and replaced all but 128GB of RAM with a pair of Optane 375GB drives, and only saw a 20 percent drop off in database performance. With the larger capacity of Optane drives over memory modules, a dual-socket Xeon system could have 24TB of memory, and a quad-socket system would top out at 48TB of memory. Intel said it sees Optane as being particularly useful for analytics, machine learning, and in-memory databases. In the future, Intel said it would produce memory modules based on 3D XPoint technology. At the end of 2016, Lenovo said it would be the first to ship Optane in its ThinkPad laptop lineup -- but the Optane drives will only be 16GB in size, and will be used in tandem with more traditional drives. In early January, Intel said it would begin labelling motherboards with an M.2 slot using its 200 series chip as "Optane Memory Ready". For the 2016 fiscal year, Intel posted operating income of $16.5 billion on revenue of $59.5 billion. Revenue for the non-volatile memory solution group came in at $2.6 billion, down 1 percent from 2015.

Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States. Picture shows a German 55 euro cents special edition stamp commemorating the the 100th anniversary of the publication of late German-born physicist Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Berlin June 15, 2005. Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs. In the late 1960s, Michael and Eugenia Brin left the USSR to escape anti-Semitism with their son. Michael Brin became a professor at the University of Maryland, and Eugenia Brin became a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Their son, Sergey Brin, received a NSF fellowship that took him to Stanford University. He met Larry Page; the duo became fast friends and transformed information technology. Google was born with an investment of $100,000 by Stanford alum and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, a German immigrant. Steve Chen, born in Taiwan, founded YouTube. Jan Koum from Ukraine founded WhatsApp. Brazilian Mike Krieger founded Instagram. Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox founder, is an Iranian-American. Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, was born to Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Andrew Grove, born in Hungary, founded Intel. Jerry Yang from Taiwan founded Yahoo, Herman Hollerith from Germany founded IBM and Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart from Germany founded Pfizer. AT&T? Alexander Graham Bell from Scotland; P&G? William Procter from England and James Gamble from Ireland; Goldman Sachs? Marcus Goldman from Germany. Pierre Omidyar, France, founded eBay. Scottish American Andrew Carnegie founded US Steel as well as Carnegie Mellon University. Irishman William Ford and Mary Ford, daughter to Belgian immigrants, raised Henry Ford who in turn founded the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, and the Ford Motor Company. General Electric's Thomas Edison was born to a Canadian father. Walt Disney, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, McDonalds — the list goes on and on and on. Fortune 500 Companies With Immigrant Roots These companies employ more than 19 million people globally with combined revenues of $4.8 trillion (2014) for the United States. This figure exceeds the GDP of every country in the world except the U.S., China, and Japan. Immigrants are twice as likely to start a new business than non-immigrants. Seven of the 10 most valuable brands in the world come from American companies founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. A Luo boy was born on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kendu Bay, British Kenya in 1936. As he grew up, he traveled widely — visiting Europe, India and Zanzibar — and became a cook for missionaries and a local herbalist in Nairobi. In 1960, he attended the University of Hawaii where he met and dated Stanley Ann Dunham, an American woman. Their son, Barack Obama, would become the seventh US president with immigrant parents—a lineage that includes Thomas Jefferson. Stanford Professor Maryam Mirzakhani was born in Iran in 1977. Twenty-two years later, she started her PhD at Harvard University. At 37, she became the first woman to win the Fields Medal—the highest honor in mathematics—putting her in a very small circle that includes Terence Tao, an Australian-American mathematician. Harvard Professor Pardis Sabeti was born in Iran in 1975 and left before the Iranian Revolution. Sabeti pioneering the use of genetic sequencing to track and monitor Ebola during its 2014 outbreak; she established critical measures to control the virus and prevent future epidemics. For 36 years, Iranian-American Firouz Naderi served the U.S. government at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, he led the deployments of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers to Mars. For his contributions to advancing space exploration, Naderi received NASA's highest honor—the Distinguished Service Medal. SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk. Reuters South African Elon Musk builds on the Martian dream with his work at SpaceX. In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world. A world where Maryam Mirzakhani and Pardis Sabeti are Canadian Professors; where Apple and Google are Canadian companies; where Carnegie Mellon University and the Industrial Revolution were founded in Canada; and so were YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Walt Disney, Oracle, Amazon, McDonalds, and innumerable other companies. Imagine Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Vinod Khosla running Canadian internet giants. For our entire history, our country has been defined by welcoming when other nations oppressed. The most American thing is unconditional love — love that ended wars; love that helped build everything from YouTube and Instagram to McDonalds and Disney; love that uncovered new laws of physics, advanced the frontiers of space, and saved countless millions of lives on earth. The most American thing ever is exclaiming boldly and unyieldingly, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.” Those were the greatest minds of the last century who came and helped transform America into the global center of innovation from technology and politics to sciences and the arts. That is our American brand. That is true greatness. Let’s make America great again.

That he was the victim of an illegal wiretap ordered by president Obama. 15 days later, we know two things. The president's charge is untrue. And he knows it's not true. At least he should. The attorney general has not dpich him evidence to back up the claim. Nor has the FBI direct, the CIA direct eer, or the director of national intelligence. He asked the senate intelligence committees to investigate. Here's what the top members of the house said this week. I don't think there was an actual tap of trump tow zplerp we have seen no basis for that whatsoever. We see no indications that trump tower wz you the subject of Su valance by any element of the United States government either before or after election day 2016. No evidence the charge is true. Overwhelming evidence it's false. Which may be why only trump's truer believers are standing by the claim. And one of his top allies in congress now says the president should apologize. To the Obama is owed an apology in that regard. Because if he didn't do it, we shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did. Instead, at that awkward press conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, trump doubled down. Joking about the fact that Merkel had been spied on by our NSA. As far as wire-tapping by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps. That look on Merkel's face shows how well the joke landed. Trump refused to disavow his press secretary's embrace that trump was spid on by British intelligence. Is the. That was a statement made by talented lawyer on fox. You shouldn't be talking to me. You should be talking to fox, okay? Fox News quickly disavowed the report. The British called it utterly ridiculous. Demanded an explanation from the national security adviser who promised it would not be repeated. Two of America's closest allies upset. The president's agenda overshadows. The credibility of his spokes people? Tatters. Tomorrow, a public showdown. The FBI director, before congress, likely to defy the president and publicly testify that the president's claim is not true. How trump responds is anyone's guess. We asked the white house for a guest to ard this topic. They declined. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

News & Analysis Intel Boots Drives with 3D XPoint Optane prices debut at 3x NAND SSDs Rick Merritt 3/19/2017 12:01 PM EDT 18 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet FOLSOM, Calif. — Intel Corp. announced its first solid-state drives using its 3D XPoint memory chips. The Optane SSDs are expected to establish a small, but significant, beachhead for the technology, which is one of several alternatives pioneering a new market between flash and DRAM chips. The DC P4800X is a server drive riding the NVMe interface, initially available in a 375-GByte version that lists for a retail price of $1,520, about three times the cost of a similar NAND card. It delivers less than 20-microsecond read-and-write latencies and a 30-disk-writes/day endurance with an estimated three-year lifetime. Intel will ship before the end of the year 750-GByte and 1.5-TByte versions with an estimated five-year lifetime. All will be available in 2.5-inch U.2 and add-in card form factors. The SSD’s performance varies widely from 2.5 to 77x better than NAND drives, depending on workloads. The drives generally beat NAND SSDs easily on read performance but are a closer match on writes that vary depending on use of buffers. Initial targets are broad but include metadata key-value searches, transaction processing, logging/journaling, and in-memory databases. Intel will sell software to spoof applications and operating systems into treating the SSDs as main memory, replacing or augmenting DRAM. Intel’s Optane controller chip supports seven channels, and performance is best with an even die-to-channel loading, a spokesman said. The initial 375 GByte drive uses four media die per channel, or 28 die total. Some Optane drive capacity outside user space is dedicated to ECC, firmware, and metadata to ensure similar reliability as NAND SSDs. However, Optane drives do not support overcapacity used in NAND SSDs because 3D XPoint is a write-in-place media not subject to NAND’s fragmentation, the spokesman added. Intel declined to forecast sales of the new drives. However, it currently hopes to fill its joint-venture fab with Micron in Lehi, Utah, by the end of the year with 3D XPoint chips for the Optane and Micron Quantx SSDs that use it. The fab is currently running less than 10,000 3D XPoint wafers/month. Micron announced its Quantx drives in August. So far Micron hasn't announced specs, prices or availability of its SSDs but said they will ship for revenue this year. A storage executive with Hewlett Packard Enterprise that expects to use Optane in servers and flash arrays estimated that the new drives could make up 5–10% of the SSDs that it buys next year. Storage analyst Alan Niebel of Web-feet Research (Monterey, California) estimated Intel’s 2017 sales at about $100 million. One wild card is how widely that big web data centers adopt the drives. Facebook expressed support for 3D XPoint a year ago and is working on supporting the RocksDB software that enables it. However, at this year’s Open Compute event, a Facebook representative had no update on its plans for the SSDs. At a launch event, Intel shared a quote from a manager of Alibaba’s data centers. He expressed enthusiasm for re-architecting the company’s search engines to make use of the Optane SSDs. It also listed China’s TenCent and server OEMs Dell EMC and Lenovo as supporters. Niebel said that the initial specs and prices were reasonable and in line with expectations. Intel’s software to enable use as main memory paves an important path for DIMM cards, with 3D XPoint expected next year, he said.

Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Yield improvements and cooking CMOS Ron Neale   3/22/2017 1:30:27 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Rick:-Suggesting that the 50% improvement in performance needed for use in DIMMs will be achieved as the yield increases is interesting. This must be interpreted that for the present generation of devices the performance is limited by unknown defect(s) resulting in some devices in all arrays not meeting the intended specification; meaning lower performance arrays are being sampled. Then the performance limiting defects will somehow apparently disappear as a function of increases in yield. Otherwise they would be already delivering at least some arrays with the 50% improvement, more of which will be obtained when the yield improves and a much larger number of arrays meet the same performance level. Is the problem with CMOS, the matrix isolation device (selector) and temperature related to processing or operation? The selector devices will be switching on every read cycle as well as the write cycles. Threshold switching is a combination of electronic and thermal effects. If for a particular composition the thermal effect dominates then the CMOS will be cooked during both read and write operations. One intriguing question is have Intel found a threshold switching selector material where the electronic effect dominates or have found one which requires fabrication and post-deposition drift-eliminating annealing temperatures compatible with CMOS fabrication. Some clarification on those points would help judge the likelihood of success.

Joaquin Castro: 'No conclusion one way or another' on Trump campaign ties to Russia And we're joined by two key members of the house intelligence committee holding the hearing with the FBI director tomorrow. Joaquin Castro, Democrat, and R R representative will Hurd. Have you seen any evidence of that? To quote my father, Bob Hurd who has given this advice to all my friends when they got married, it never hurts to say you're sorry. You think the president should say he's voir? Think so. It helds with our allies. We live if a dangerous world. We can't do this alone. When we have major ally. Not just sorry to the president. But also to the uk. For the claims, or the intimation that the uk was involved in this as well. It doesn't hurt. It takes away from the rest of his agenda. And congressman Castro, I assume you agree with that right there. What do you expect from FBI director Comey tomorrow? Do you think he's prepared to address this publicly? On the wiretapping, I hope he will. This will be an opportunity for us to have an open discussion about this investigation. I'm sure that we're not going to hear everything because we're not in a classified setting. There are a few things I'm hoping to hear. First, whether any Americans are being investigating for cooperating or conspiring with the Russians. Second, the scope of the investigation. Third, a timeline for resolving it. To follow up on something Chris ruddy was saying. We have the former director of intelligence saying he's seen no evidence of collusion with people from the trump campaign and the Russians. Have you? It's my understanding that's what's being investigated. He's stating there's a conclusion being reached. My understanding is that's being investigated. You haven't seen any evidence? No conclusion one way or another. Meanwhile, congressman Hurd, how do you expect to go about this? And bottom line, do you think the house intelligence committee will get to the bottom of this? What is it going to stake? I think it takes a bipartisan, thoughtful, thorough investigation. E think some folks will be frustrated on Monday not hearing certain answers because there may be an active investigation going on. Criminal investigation. If there's an active criminal investigation, we need to allow awe enforcement in order to do their job. Then the house and senate intelligence commutes should be reviewing what law enforcement's responses have been. What the intelligence community is doing. I'm looking forward on Monday to having the NSA director and the FBI director go through the time line, publicly, on the Russian involvement in our -- in attempts to influence our elections. What was -- how did we respond? And also, part of this is, if we understand what they did to plot out how we defend against this in the future. And maybe be able to tell our allies like France and Germany what they should be doing to inculcate themselves from Russian attacks. How much damage has been done to our intelligence relationships with great Britain and perhaps Germany as well? Given what's happened in the last couple of days. It's quite alarming, George. You think about our long standing relationship with the British. Our relationship and information-sharing with the five eyes. And how hostile the president has been, not only to the CIA and the FBI, our own intelligence age sis. Also to Australia. Now Britain, certainly Germany. These relationships work. And working together on things like counterterrorism is only successful if these nations and their intelligence agencies trust and have confidence in the United States. So when you hear these outlandish comments, what I keep thinking is that there's a real possibility that the president is undermining these relationships. As you know, congressman Hurd, the president and his allies believe he's been undermined by people inside the intelligence community. You have worked at the CIA. What do you make of the claims there's a so-called "Deep state" working against president trump? I spent 9 1/2 years as an undercover officer. I was the dude in the back alleys at 4:00 in the morning collecting intelligence. You have professional intelligence folks. And you have the political intelligence folks. The men and the women in the CIA, they do their job regardless of who is in the white house. Same with the NSA. Same with the FBI. They putting themselves in harm's way. Have to deal with difficult situations. What I think -- this is how the intelligence community refers to the Russian involvement or attempts to manipulate our elections, grizzly stat -- it will go down in the history of mother Russia as the greatest covert action. Not because trump won. But because it created a wedge, real or perceived, between the white house, the intelligence community, and the American pluck. This investigation has to be bipartisan. Thorough. And it has to be thoughtful. We're feeding into the covert action narrative that the Russians are trying to create. Thank you both for your time.

Ryzen 5 reports in on April 11 with chips from $169 to $249 by Jeff Kampman  9:00 PM on March 15, 2017 AMD's Ryzen 7 CPUs have made a splash for the workstation-class builder with their many threads at friendly prices, but not all of us need eight cores and 16 threads to churn through our computing tasks. The logical step down for more mainstream folks is the Ryzen 5 series of chips. AMD revealed two of those parts—the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X—alongside the Ryzen 7 family, and today we're learning more about a new pair of Ryzen 5 CPUs that complete the midrange tier of AMD's new processor lineup. Model Cores Threads Base clock Boost clock XFR TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 GHz 4.0 GHz Yes 95W $249 Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 3.6 GHz 65W $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.7 GHz $189 Ryzen 5 1400 3.2 GHz 3.4 GHz $169 At the top of the range, the Ryzen 5 1600X is joined by the Ryzen 5 1600. The 1600X will likely be pitted against Intel's entry-level six-core CPU, the Core i7-6800K. The aggressively-clocked 1600X boasts what AMD calls a "full" XFR range, although the company says the definition of "full" isn't being revealed at this time, and our guess is that it could vary from chip to chip in this lineup. Of the Ryzen 5 CPUs being announced today, the 1600X is the only one that will slot into a 95W TDP. Meanwhile, the modestly-clocked Ryzen 5 1600 retains XFR, but it likely won't benefit as much as its sibling from a bigger cooler on top.  That chip puts an impressive six cores and 12 threads into a trim 65W thermal envelope. Most builders are used to four cores and eight threads from Intel's $300+ Core i7 CPUs, but AMD is taking four Zen cores with SMT under $200 with the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. The Ryzen 5 1500X will boast 200 MHz of XFR headroom on top of its already-appealing base speeds, and it'll retain the unlocked multiplier common to all Ryzen CPUs. Whether that's enough to match or outpace the potent Core i5-7500 at $205 will be an interesting question as we approach review time. At the base of the lineup, the Ryzen 7 1400 offers what could be an impressive level of multithreaded performance and unlocked multipliers for about $25 less than the Core i5-7400. AMD will include unilluminated versions of its Wraith Spire cooler with the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X, while the Ryzen 5 1400 will get the more modest Wraith Stealth heatsink. In response to questions about whether it would offer RGB LED-illuminated versions of these coolers separately, AMD said that builders who want the blinkenlights will need to shell out for a Ryzen 7 chip. As the enthusiast-class six-core chip in this lineup, the Ryzen 5 1600X will sell as a bare processor only. Some mysteries remain about the Ryzen 5 lineup. AMD didn't answer my questions about CCX arrangements for these parts, although the wide XFR boost range the company let slip for the Ryzen 5 1500X suggests that only one CCX may be underneath four-core Ryzens' heat spreaders. We also don't know these chips' cache arrangements just yet. All will be revealed soon enough, as AMD says the entire Ryzen 5 family will hit store shelves April 11.

A turbulent history has stifled the economy, but things are starting to look up for the Caucasus republic. A highly-skilled, post-soviet engineering workforce and a diaspora of advocates, combined with new government initiatives, are igniting renewed growth in Armenia’s IT sector. These businesses are creating new technologies — from award-winning mobile apps to world-first presentation tools — recognized across the globe and many startups are making their way to the US. The Armenian tech industry is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, greatly exceeding the country’s two percent economic growth. Annual tech revenues from some 400 IT companies make up $475 million and by 2018, it is estimated this industry will be the dominant sector driving new wealth for the economy.

Armenia’s tech scene is at a real turning point. The Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union has morphed into a thriving tech startup hub, attracting global recognition. So, how is the Armenian tech scene growing? What is the country doing to drive international investment and which startups are making the biggest waves in the global tech scene? Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. © Provided by The Next Web This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. © Provided by The Next Web Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEO Ara Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator of Voiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. © Provided by The Next Web Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obama explaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Itel.am. © Provided by The Next Web In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched the Armenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation.

US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Itel.am. © Provided by The Next Web In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched the Armenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon A former DND employee and Canadian Forces soldier whose $400-a-day cocaine addiction led to the theft of nearly $1 million in computer parts from the federal government was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison Friday. And if 33-year-old Andrew Heggaton doesn’t pay back the $966,933.82 the Intel core processors, hard drives, motherboards, and graphics cards were worth within the next eight years, he could be sentenced to another three years of prison time. Ontario Court Justice Heather Perkins-McVey said the fraud had a “significant impact” on the Canadian Forces Crypto Support Unit where Heggaton once worked, leaving its IT network on the verge of collapsing and seriously affecting the unit’s capacity to function. “This is not a victimless crime,” Perkins-McVey told Heggaton during the sentencing. “This is the type of offence that erodes the public trust.” Heggaton pleaded guilty to fraud, trafficking in property obtained by crime and breach of trust by a public officer after stealing the computer parts over a four-year period between 2011 and March 2015. Some of the computer parts were sold by Heggaton on the Internet classified site Kijiji. Heggaton told a probation officer who prepared a pre-sentence report for the court that drug addiction fuelled the thefts. Heggaton, who had been a soldier in the Canadian Forces for eight years between 2001 and 2009, had begun using illicit drugs during a seven-month tour in Afghanistan in 2003. It all went up his nose The drug use began spiralling out of control once he returned to Canada, and he started using magic mushrooms, ecstasy, speed and cocaine. Heggaton has since attended some Narcotics Anonymous meetings, but has made no effort to attend formal drug addiction counselling, the judge said. “He has nothing to show for it,” Heggaton’s lawyer Michael Smith of the fraud during a sentencing hearing earlier in the week. “It all went up his nose.” Heggaton was arrested after suppliers started contacting DND in 2014 looking for payment for outstanding invoices for computer equipment that had been ordered but could not be located. Heggaton was listed on the invoices and would have received the items, many of which were ordered with authorization forms that didn’t have any recognizable signature or were missing an additional level of certification. When challenged by his superiors, Heggaton gave nonsensical answers or tried to pass off older model computers as the missing merchandise.

The CFCSU verified the processors were not required, the parcel was put out for delivery and Heggaton was placed under surveillance. Heggaton was stopped as he left work, and 15 of the processors and four hard drives were recovered from his bag. A search of his work space uncovered additional suspicious invoices and orders along with brand new hi-tech computer parts that were not used by the unit. During his sentencing submissions, Crown prosecutor Bruce Lee-Shanok said Heggaton’s greed left his co-workers under the lens of suspicion before his arrest. In a victim impact statement, a major said that morale in the unit had reached an all-time low, according to Lee-Shanok. Court heard Heggaton grew up in a military family. He was born on a military base in Germany. His father was in the British forces, and the family relocated often to bases across the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. His arrest has strained his relationship with his family, court heard. Heggaton has since attempted suicide and was admitted to hospital for his depression, Perkins-McVey said. He is now on public assistance, although he earns some extra money fixing laptop computers. During a hearing earlier in the week, Heggaton told the judge he intends to use his time behind bars on redemption. “I truly understand the actions betrayed the trust that had been placed in me by my country,” said Heggaton. “I realize that my actions were inexcusable, and for that I am deeply sorry.” Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   PDFpen is your Swiss Army knife for PDFs.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

A recently revised service document has now surfaced that seems to indicate Microsoft may be getting ready to enforce that policy that was originally announced last year. According to that updated support document, Microsoft will block any Windows 7 or 8.1 machine that is running the latest processors from AMD, Intel , or Qualcomm from getting security updates for the OS. Computerworld states that one potential message to users of Windows 7 or 8.1 systems that have newer processors inside might see reads, “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” A possible error code that computers running new processors on these older OS versions might see is 80240037. That error code will be seen when Windows 7 or 8.1 machines running a 7th gen processor from Intel, Qualcomm or AMD try and download security updates. This would include processors like Kaby Lake, Bristol Ridge, and the Snapdragon 820 series. Presumably this would include AMD Ryzen processors as well. As for why these machines will be blocked from getting security updates, Microsoft has stated that getting Windows 7 and 8.1 to run on these processors is “challenging.” This led Microsoft to decide only Windows 10 would support these newer processors and to shorten Windows 7 support. Windows 7 will be supported on 6th gen processors like Intel Skylake processors until July 17, 2017. Terry Perry So what i have Never loaded SP 1 or Newer for W-7 and still play ALL the Games.

House Republicans plan to vote on their Obamacare replacement on Thursday, as you might have heard. But that doesn’t mean they’re done tweaking the measure. Speaker Paul Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday” that GOP lawmakers were looking at boosting the subsidies for buying health care for people in their 50s and 60s, as our Ian Kullgren reports. (This was also the word coming out of a Friday conference meeting on the American Health Care Act.) Story Continued Below Meantime, President Donald Trump and his administration are starting to warn conservatives to get in line. WHICH ALSO MEANS: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) likes to talk about how tax reform and health care can run on parallel tracks, but work on Obamacare has understandably pushed taxes to the backburner. Ways and Means Republicans have barely gotten into the topic recently, according to one of them who spoke to Morning Tax on Friday. Instead, the lawmaker — who didn't want to be named, in order to more freely discuss the situation — said that the broader GOP debate over the party’s Affordable Care Act replacement had trickled down into committee meetings. More on the Republican state of mind: Trump said recently that he wanted to deal with taxes before health care. So why didn’t that happen? Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that it’s because of all the promises the GOP had made to repeal Obamacare. “It's a heavy lift? Yes. Do you need to sometimes hit the bad news and the heavy lift first? I think so,” Blackburn said. (The implication here is that tax reform is at least easier than replacing Obamacare. Morning Tax might be parochial on this, but we’re guessing tax reform will be plenty hard, if it happens.) SPICER’S TIMELINE: Sean Spicer doesn’t think it will be long until the administration and Congress will be able to really focus on tax reform, according to an interview the White House press secretary gave Ireland’s Sunday Independent. "We are going to have tax reform after we get health care completed … I think we are looking at late spring to summer," Spicer said, via Reuters. (We’re guessing Spicer doesn’t think tax reform can actually be finished by late spring.) WHILE WE’RE WAITING … : Corporate America wants a tax overhaul, but it’s not just going to sit on its hands while Washington gets its act together. In fact, multinationals are using their stash of offshore cash — which they’re hoping to get a lower tax rate on sometime soon — to buy up some foreign companies, Bloomberg reports. That includes Intel, which just a week ago said it would pay $15 billion to buy an Israeli company, while Johnson & Johnson said it’d pay double that for a Swiss outfit back in January. And there’s probably more where that came from: “No one wants to wait for the tax change,” said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, who helps run American mergers and acquisitions for UBS. “If you’re going to wait for that or time your deal around that, you can’t.” WELCOME TO MONDAY, where we’re still recovering from this weekend’s NCAA Tournament action. Perhaps a more important development: It’s also 101 years since something called Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was published. What’s going on out there?

LET’S GET RUNNING: The American Made Coalition, the group of big exporters and other companies supporting the House GOP tax blueprint, has taken the big leap — by putting a commercial on the television airwaves. The spot, which first went up Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” argues that a tax overhaul along the lines of the House plan would stem the tide of jobs leaving the U.S., by evening out the treatment of exports and imports. Still, the spot also doesn’t seem to make the case that tax reform alone would cure everything. “For years, lights have been turned out in American factories. Lights that likely won't be turned on again,” the script from the ad says, before adding: “Support tax reform and create 1.7 million new American jobs.” The advertisement will continue to run through April 9 in the Washington metro area on cable stations like CNBC, Fox Business, Fox News and MSNBC. Other moving pictures: The group opposing the House plan also has a new video, though one that you shouldn’t expect to see on the television any time soon. Americans for Affordable Products’ new video has more of an edge to it, asking viewers whether they trusted retail (and other) chief executives more than Brady on the potential impact of a border adjustment. Also new from the anti-side, and with a pretty catchy name: “Deplorables Against a Consumer Tax Hike.” It’s not on television either, but the group from Tea Party Nation and other organizations on the right is starting to run digital ads — targeting about a dozen House Republicans, including Brady, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. (Though we do have to wonder: Would a wife at her kitchen table complaining about higher prices at the grocery store really refer to “crony capitalists?”) ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Tax simplification should be the cornerstone of tax reform, with an emphasis of simplifying our outmoded tax code to accommodate today’s modern families dynamics. This Monday, March 27, Tax Foundation and ITFC will bring together today’s leading tax policy minds to shed light on this complicated topic. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2n7ELgJ ** THE FLIP SIDE ON THE IRS BUDGET: Sure, the IRS took less of a hit from the first Trump budget than even some of the president’s fellow Republicans expected. But Howard Gleckman at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy argues that another year of asking the IRS to do more with less would still be a bad development. (And to be clear, there’d likely be plenty of Republicans who’d be interested in even deeper cuts than $239 million, even after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested the cuts might have gone too far.) “Collecting revenue is only part of what Congress asks the IRS to do. The tax agency also runs a big part of the nation’s safety for the poor through refundable tax credits such as the earned income credit and the child credit. It is partially responsible for managing the Affordable Care Act’s system of credits and penalties for individual health insurance,” Gleckman wrote, noting that the GOP’s proposed replacement for Obamacare would also give the IRS full oversight of insurance subsidies and adding: “No one should expect the IRS to do the increasingly complex job Congress demands with a budget that is nearly one-fifth smaller than it was in 2010.” INTERNATIONAL NEWS CHINA DAWDLES ON THE PROPERTY TAX: Economists think China might want to follow the U.S. in this respect — instituting a property tax. And yet the topic didn’t come up at this month’s National People’s Congress, The Wall Street Journal reports. The case for a property tax: “For many Chinese families, owning a home is one of few options to build wealth, driving buying frenzies as people rush to purchase before prices soar. Imposing costs on homeowners through a property tax is seen as a way to tame such speculation, while also helping fund local governments.” TALK ABOUT GRASSROOTS ENERGY: The Lebanese prime minister got empty water bottles thrown at him on Sunday while trying to calm protesters about proposed tax increases, Reuters reports. About 2,000 protesters gathered in Beirut’s Riad al-Solh Square, where some of them also shouted “thief” at the prime minister, Saad al-Hariri. Lebanese lawmakers have already raised some taxes, including a one percentage point hike in the sales tax, and are expected to consider even more soon. The Lebanese government wants to increase wages for public employees. STATE UPDATE CALIFORNIA GOES AFTER THE MID: California lawmakers, seeking to spur more affordable housing in a state not known for it, have a new target — owners of vacation homes. A new proposal would strip home owners of their mortgage interest deduction for a second home and, according to the Mercury News, “channel the gains — at least $220 million annually, according to initial estimates by the state Franchise Tax Board — to a state affordable housing program. Supporters say that would cover the cost of creating 3,000 new units of affordable housing, and it could leverage $600 million to $1 billion in additional federal housing dollars.” QUICK LINKS Washington Examiner points out that Alan Auerbach, lead advocate for border adjustability, advised John Kerry’s presidential campaign. Eric Trump calls the leak of his father’s tax returns “dangerous.” Palm Beach, Fla., mayor suggests the city might have to raise taxes because of Trump’s visits to Mar-a-Lago. UBS “very pessimistic” about the prospects of a settlement with France over tax fraud. The U.K. might have to lean on spending cuts to make up for a scrapped plan to raise taxes on the self-employed. The big box “dark store” debate heads to Wisconsin. DID YOU KNOW? The actor Keanu Reeves was born in Beirut. ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Tax simplification should be the cornerstone of tax reform. Both the new Congress and the new administration have stated their deep commitment to enacting meaningful tax reform in 2017. It’s important that tax reform includes an emphasis on simplifying our outmoded tax code to accommodate today’s complex family situations. Can it be done in a way that’s both efficient and equitable? This Monday, March 27, Tax Foundation and Intuit Tax and Financial Center will bring together some of today’s leading tax policy minds to shed light on this complicated topic.

A week after US chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8bn for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3bn in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40pc of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry. "Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way," Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian President Narenda Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel's largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel's former ambassador to Beijing, said China's interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel's culture of high-tech innovation and doesn't push beyond that. "It's very simple: technology, technology, technology," he told Reuters. Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv's metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel's former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China's leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues. "The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment," he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu's point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialisation. "Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development - airports, sewage lines, water - once you've done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology," Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Beijing. "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort."

Green asked the question in a letter originally published in Hebrew in Haaretz, the Israeli daily. He said he's scheduled to be here in Israel for academic conferences in June and October, and that during his last trip he gave 15 lectures. Green is modest; he doesn't explain how prominent he is in the American Jewish community as a rabbinic educator, theologian, and scholar of Jewish mysticism. He does, however, say that he will not use wine from the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba for kiddush, the blessing over wine on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. There are grounds to believe that products of settlements are tainted by theft, he writes with careful understatement. In his letter, he encourages others to follow his practice. That is, he openly encourages boycotting the products of a settlement. So, he asks, is he now barred from entering Israel? That's the implication of the law recently enacted by the Knesset, which says that no visa of any kind will be given to a would-be visitor who has called for a boycott of Israel, or who “has committed himself to take part in such a boycott.” And this also applies to any form of boycott of Israeli settlements. So, Green asks, should he cancel his trips? Since I lack his awe-inspiring restraint, I'll rephrase this question to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the lawmakers of his right-wing coalition: Are you for real? Do you get that you just legislated our very own travel ban, one that obligates you to deny visas not just to BDS supporters, but also to everyone like Rabbi Arthur Green—supporters of Israel who, out of real concern for the country's character, will not buy settlement products? Do you realize how just plain embarrassing this is going to get? Let's work our way through the law's absurdities. To start, it treats the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign as if it were a serious threat to Israel. The recent sale of the Israeli high-tech firm Mobileye to Intel for $15.3 billion—the latest and largest acquisition of an Israeli start-up by an international tech giant—hints at how silly this is. The mainstay of the Israeli economy is high-tech, with innovations tangled into everything you use. An effective consumer boycott of Israel would start with its supporters throwing their phones in the nearest lake and continue with them swearing off all that is digital. This isn't going to be a thing. On the other hand, sanctions by foreign governments would be serious business. The best way for Israel to avoid those is to reassure its Western allies and trading partners that inside Israel proper, democracy is flourishing, while the future of the occupied territories is a policy disagreement among friends. A law banning foreign visitors based on their political statements and affiliations doesn't say much for democratic norms. For a BDS activist, getting some press on being turned back at the airport because of her political opinions is likely to be much more useful than wandering around the occupied territories snapping pictures of roadblocks and settlements. The law itself aims to erase distinctions between Israel and the occupied territories. It fits the Israeli right's stance that opposition to settlements is pretty much the same as hostility toward Israel's very existence. This is both a mindset—Netanyahu and his allies really do see the settlements as integrally part of Israel—and a political tactic. It tars critics of government policies as enemies of the state. It creates bogeymen. The liberal majority of American Jews generally opposes settlement, as polling shows. That doesn't mean that lots of U.S. Jews actively boycott settlements—assuming they run into settlement products that they can avoid buying. (It's not as if there's a boutique wine from a settlement vineyard in every American liquor store.) But my guess is that the new law will cause more U.S. Jews to boycott settlements, and to say so publicly. Green's letter won't be an isolated case. So by legislating against settlement boycotts, the right-wing majority in the Knesset has actually promoted them. From my perspective, that's the one positive thing that can be said about the law. But it's not what the law's authors had in mind. This brings us to another folly: Any attempt to enforce the law is likely cause one PR disaster after another, as prominent Diaspora Jews get stopped at Ben-Gurion Airport and pushed onto return flights It's much more likely that the law will be enforced sporadically or not at all. Perhaps the line allowing the interior minister to grant an individual boycotter a visa under special circumstances will be applied to virtually everyone. The law could well be a dead letter, whose only effect will have been to highlight the kind of protest it's ostensibly meant to prevent. So why bother with such a law, and why now? The answer to the first half of that question is that the Israeli right has historically had a penchant for grand gestures and declarations, especially ones that strike a pose of defiance. As for the timing, the answer is pretty clear: Donald Trump. Since January, discussion of U.S.-Israel relations has quite reasonably focused on the new regime's attitude toward settlement-building and peace efforts. But this is too narrow a perspective. For years, the Israeli right has been trying to chip away at democratic rights through legislation. One impediment has been fear of the American reaction. The fear is gone. In early February, the Knesset passed a law allowing the government to expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements had been built. It violates basic property rights as enshrined in international law. The bill was held up in the last days of the Obama administration, then quickly passed after the change of power in Washington. Next came the law barring entry to boycott advocates. It's not as if anyone expects a strong message from Washington in 2017 against a travel ban that flies in the face of fundamental rights. As for relations with liberal American Jews, that's clearly not on Netanyahu's list of concerns. Neither is having the new law actually accomplish anything. The point is the statement: The world (except for the White House) is against us, but we are defiant. With the rise of Trump, the paranoid style is in full control in Israeli politics.

By DiversityInc Staff / March 20, 2017 BASF SE (No. 24 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced that the companies will collaborate to develop one of the world’s largest supercomputers for industrial chemical research at BASF’s Ludwigshafen headquarters this year. Based on the latest generation of HPE Apollo 6000 systems, the new supercomputer will drive the digitalization of BASF’s worldwide research. “The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modeling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF,” said Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF. “The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs.” The new system will make it possible to answer complex questions and reduce the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. As part of BASF’s digitalization strategy, the company plans to significantly expand its capabilities to run virtual experiments with the supercomputer. It will help BASF reduce time to market and costs by, for example, simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely or accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties. “In today’s data-driven economy, high performance computing plays a pivotal role in driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence,” said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “We expect this supercomputer to help BASF perform prodigious calculations at lightning fast speeds, resulting in a broad range of innovations to solve new problems and advance our world.” With the help of Intel Xeon processors, high-bandwidth, low-latency Intel Omni-Path Fabric and HPE management software, the supercomputer acts as a single system with an effective performance of more than 1 Petaflop (1 Petaflop equals one quadrillion floating point operations per second). With this system architecture, a multitude of nodes can work simultaneously on highly complex tasks, dramatically reducing the processing time. “Customers are always looking for systems that deliver the best performance at the best total cost of ownership,” said Barry Davis, General Manager, Accelerated Workload Group, Intel. “Intel Omni-Path Architecture is specifically designed to deliver outstanding performance while scaling cost-effectively from entry-level high performance computing clusters to larger clusters with 10,000 nodes or more – offering a significant advantage on both fronts.” Developed and built with HPE, the new supercomputer will consist of several hundred computer nodes. The supercomputer will also leverage HPE Apollo Systems to give customers simplified administration efficiencies and flexibility to match their solutions to the workload.

The Crosshair VI Hero is ASUS's current top offering for the AMD AM4 platform and uses AMD's X370 chipset. The X370 chipset and Ryzen CPU ecosystem is no longer similar to that of Intel, or anything we have seen before.   The chipset, be it X370 or B350, are IO extensions of the CPU, they are basically South Bridges without system management capabilities. Things such as the BIOS and HD audio connections, which have almost always been on another chip, are now integrated into the CPU. In fact, the one reason the motherboards require a chipset is to authenticate the CPU and provide secure operation. AMD even has chipsets that have almost no IO, such as the X300, that allows overclocking and multi-GPU capabilities.     If you want multi-GPU capabilities, you have to go with an X series chipset. The Crosshair VI Hero is the result of a long line of ROG based products on the AMD side of things. They are designed to be the best overclockers and are loaded with the latest ROG features. The Crosshair VI Hero was launched on March 2nd and has since taken multiple world records. It's also one of few motherboards with an external clock generator, which is required for FSB/BCLK/bus speed adjustment.   Let's take a look at what ASUS has to offer for your high-end Ryzen rig.     Specifications     The Crosshair VI Hero offers USB 3.1 on the rear IO and through an internal type-C header, 12 USB ports on the rear IO, Intel LAN, high-end audio, multi-GPU support, eight SATA ports, M.2, and even two RGB headers.     Pricing   The Crosshair VI Hero costs around $255.

By Teresea Hanafin Globe Staff  March 20, 2017 What's it like outside? Sunny, high 40s and low 50s. Spring officially arrived at 6:29 a.m. EDT. It's the moment when the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth's axis and Earth's orbit around the sun are aligned in such a way that the planet's two hemispheres are receiving the sun's rays equally, creating about the same amount of sunlight and darkness everywhere -- the vernal equinox . For the Southern Hemisphere, it's all downhill now, since it will be tilted away from the sun for the next six months. But we're sittin' pretty, facing the sun, days growing longer until the summer solstice June 21. There's promise in the air. Hey, sport: The Celtics host the Washington Wizards, a team that's breathing down their necks in the Eastern Conference and against whom the Cs have a 1-2 record this season (7:30 p.m., CSNHD and 100.7 FM). The Celtics suffered an embarrassing loss to the 76ers yesterday, 105-99.

Will that kill the deal? Will Comey's testimony show that Trump is lying? FBI Director James Comey testifies publicly at 10 a.m. before the House Intelligence Committee about two main issues: whether former President Barack Obama had candidate Donald Trump illegally wiretapped at Trump Tower, as Trump has maintained for two weeks, and the status of the FBI's investigation into Russia's attempt to influence the presidential election -- including whether any members of the Trump campaign were involved. Comey is unlikely to give any details about the Russia investigation if it is still underway -- he may not even acknowledge there is a probe. Both the chairman of the Intel Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, and former national intelligence director James Clapper have both said they have seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. But the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Adam Schiff of California, says there is circumstantial evidence, whatever that means. Advertisement At any rate, Comey is expected to say there was no Obama-ordered wiretapping or surveillance of Trump in New York. The story there will be how Trump reacts; several Republicans have already said he should apologize to Obama. HA! Those Repubs are such cards. Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will testify as well. One guy not on the House's list is Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Trump who used to work on the campaign. But he is in the crosshairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe. They asked him not to destroy any paper or electronic records he has that could be relevant to the investigation into the Russian funny business. He's the guy who communicated with both Julian Assange of Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0, an election hacker the US believes is a front for Russian intelligence. Trump at 6:35 a.m.: "James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!" Trump at 6:49 a.m.: "The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" It's going to be one of those days. Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 11 a.m., with Democrats still smarting from the GOP's refusal to even hold a hearing for Obama nominee Merrick Garland. But they have to tread carefully: If they filibuster, and the GOP exercises the so-called "nuclear option" -- changing the Senate rules to require a simple majority of 51 votes rather than 60 -- it will be a lot easier for Republicans to approve a far more conservative Supreme Court nominee if another vacancy comes up. The Dems apparently have five main lines of questioning for Gorsuch, according to Politico: Contraception and Obamacare, his defense of the Bush policy of housing detainees at Gitmo, judicial independence under Trump, workers' rights, and his lack of deference to how federal agencies interpret laws. Trump meets with a real billionaire, Bill Gates, today; Gates is upset about Trump's budget blueprint, which slashes foreign aid, including to global health agencies. As Gates wrote in an essay in Time magazine: "These projects keep Americans safe. And by promoting health, security and economic opportunity, they stabilize vulnerable parts of the world." Not so sure how private-sector, tablet-toting "ambassadors" with fake smiles in Boston's T stations will make the trains run on time or feel less like cattle cars, but MBTA officials believe privatizing customer service will save $8.3 million a year. The current service people won't lose their jobs; they will fill vacancies as subway operators or do other jobs. The T's fiscal board discusses the plan today. There's a fight shaping up on Beacon Hill over who will oversee the state's legalized marijuana industry. The committee set up to shape policy holds its first public hearing at 11 a.m. Meanwhile, Treasurer Deborah Goldberg, the state's top regulator, has already started setting up a bureaucracy to handle the job, according to the Globe's Joshua Miller: She has budget plans, organizational charts, names of potential Cannabis Control commissioners, and lists of companies to track sales. Some legislators think she's jumping the gun before the committee has even met. Others don't believe she should be the sole oversight authority; they are proposing that several elected officials fill that role to dilute any one person's power. A little weed would mellow everybody out. The state Legislature's House and Senate Ways and Means Committees holds a public hearing at Worcester State University at 9 a.m. to get input from various agencies such as the judiciary, Office of Campaign and Political Finance, and the Ethics Commission. State social workers will be on the march through Boston today. About 800 of them will gather at Faneuil Hall, walk to the State House en masse around noon to reassemble in the Great Hall, then spread out to lobby legislators on issues affecting them.  France holds its first televised debate among its presidential candidates, and the hot topics are immigration, security, and the economy. A centrist, Emmanuel Macron, is leading in the polls, but the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, is close behind.      Finally, on this day in 1934, athlete extraordinaire Babe Didrikson pitched one inning of exhibition pro baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics against the Brooklyn Dodgers. No hits, one walk. Two years before, she had set world records in the javelin throw, 80-meter hurdles, high jump, and baseball throw at the AAU championships, then went on to the Olympics in LA that same year. She qualified for five events, but could compete in just three because, you know, she was a girl. She set a world record in the javelin throw and a world record in the 80-meter hurdles. She tied with another competitor in the high jump, but the judges didn't like her head-first style, so gave her the silver instead. In high school in Texas, she excelled at basketball and track. In 1933, in her 20s, she decided to take up golf for the first time, and completely dominated the sport, winning 82 tournaments and helping to start the LPGA. When asked how a "girl" could hit a golf ball so far, Babe said one of my favorite quotes: "Just take off your girdle and swing." Words to live by. Wikimedia Babe Didrikson dominated women’s golf, a sport she didn’t take up until her 20s. Thanks for reading. Jimmy Breslin said, "Rage is the only quality which has kept me, or anybody I have ever studied, writing columns for newspapers." And folks, if you really want to swing, don't stop at the girdle.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Yogi Adityanath Trivendra Singh Rawat Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home World As part of Asia pivot, Netanyahu pushes Israeli hi-tech in China Shares1 Mon, 20 Mar 2017-06:26pm , Reuters China's economy may be 35 times larger than Israel's, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel's economy towards Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after U.S. chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3 billion in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40 percent of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry. "Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way," Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian President Narenda Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel's largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel's former ambassador to Beijing, said China's interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel's culture of high-tech innovation and doesn't push beyond that. "It's very simple: technology, technology, technology," he told Reuters. Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv's metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel's former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China's leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues. "The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment," he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu's point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialisation. "Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development - airports, sewage lines, water - once you've done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology," Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Bejing. "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort." (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

For more details and to purchase your ticket visit wiredevent.co.uk The world is full of big figures, but this one is more shocking than most. $600bn (£483bn) is lost every year from global trade as a result of “maritime fraud” - when goods go walkabout from ships during transactions. And this is just one tiny part of the global business of trade. Add it all up, and there are likely trillions of dollars lost to fraud each year. A coalition of companies, coders and charities believe they have a solution: the blockchain. ADVERTISEMENT Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started WIRED Horizons 07 Nov 2016 “The blockchain can do for transactions what the internet did for information,” says Arvind Krishna, senior vice president at IBM overseeing the company’s involvement in the Hyperledger project, a new fabric for the blockchain to be used in a range of industries, including healthcare, shipping and government services. The blockchain itself is a decentralised electronic ledger, with duplicate copies on thousands of computers around the world. It cannot be altered retrospectively, meaning authentication and ownership is easier to certify and less vulnerable to fraud. The diamond industry is a great example of the power of the blockchain. A diamond's origin can be rapidly lost as it exchanges hands over the years. But Everledger, a global digital registry for diamonds, powered by the blockchain, was founded in 2015 to help prevent this. READ NEXT Mobile-only bank N26 hits 300,000 customers Mobile-only bank N26 hits 300,000 customers By Alexandra Simon-Lewis The Hyperledger project is an open source, open governance group allowing anyone who signs up as a legitimate member to participate. IBM got involved in the middle of 2015 and during the initial stages its engineers were the driving force behind the lion’s share of the work. That has now changed to include significant involvement from the London Stock Exchange, Cisco and Intel. It has seen IBM partner up with more than 100 other companies to try and iron out the levels of distrust in the world’s transactions. “For the first time with blockchain, we have a way of a transaction happening where both people can trust each other; that the information they put in cannot be changed or altered once the network has accepted it.” Subscribe to WIRED ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT TransferWise partners with digital-only Starling Bank TransferWise partners with digital-only Starling Bank By Lee Bell By ironing out the fear of fraud, not only could the blockchain prevent money disappearing from business: it could also open up those businesses to a new range of people. “When you have this inherent lack of trust in the world, you create third-party intermediaries – but the fact you have these means there’s extra cost and friction in business,” says Krishna, who will be speaking at WIRED Money 2017. That extra cost and effort to engage with third parties means that smaller businesses are often excluded from bigger deals. “A little farmer in a little country has no way of getting into the supply chain for McDonalds because it’s too expensive,” Krishna says. “But if a blockchain allows them to participate that means they can make a bit more revenue.” IBM In all, 50 IBM workers are involved in the Hyperledger project. “It’s a big investment from us,” Krishna says, and mimics their involvement in a similar open source computing project in the late 1990s: Linux. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT WIRED Money 2017: The Startup Stage WIRED Money 2017: The Startup Stage The Linux Foundation hosts the Hyperledger project, and hopes that the distributed ledger format of the blockchain will allow transactions to be carried out on computers with a level of trust and accountability that is too frequently missing from modern-day trade. That trust should extend not only to business-to-business interactions, but customers too. “In retail, when it comes to the provenance of the goods I’m buying, I really want to know they came from a certain manufacturer,” explains Krishna. The Hyperledger will allow consumers to see where their bananas or flatscreen TV has come from through an indelible, inalterable record in the blockchain. In healthcare, the number of different health systems involved in many countries outside the UK means there’s a mass of information, some of which can get lost in translation. The Hyperledger aims to counteract that. In government, passports and official ID could be held in the blockchain, cutting down on identity fraud and providing a better, stronger database of records. And in the financial services industry, securities clearing and settlement of foreign exchange can benefit from permanent records that can’t be fudged. “In all of these, blockchain is literally going to change the way the world works,” says Krishna. ADVERTISEMENT In early March the first practical example of the Hyperledger came to fruition. In partnership with Maersk, IBM launched a blockchain solution that helps manage the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers traversing the world’s seas – accountable for 90 per cent of goods in global trade. It aims to help cut down on maritime fraud, and to eat into the cost (estimated to be around 20 per cent of the cost of physically transporting the goods) of processing documentation for each container. Of course, for those outside the WIRED universe, the idea of the blockchain and the Hyperledger remain abstruse concepts. “Today, when you mention it most people look for an explanation,” says Krishna. But give it time and it’ll become better known. “When we talked about the internet back in 1993, it was the same. It was only this thing a few people understood. Then within five years it went from being an esoteric term reserved for nerds and the cognoscenti to being a word that was presumed everyone knew what it means.” WIRED asks if we’re using that analogy, where we are with the blockchain right now. Krishna replies right away: “1994.” So we probably have four or five years before the massive explosion, the great switch on, the blockchain equivalent of the great dial-up roll out? “Correct,” says Krishna. “But as we’ve seen with other things, the world moves fast. It might not take five years.” View Event WIRED Money 2017 WIRED Money Business Blockchain IBM Share this article RECOMMENDED How the blockchain could make you thousands through car shares and selling electricity How the blockchain could make you thousands through car shares and selling electricity By Alex Tapscott Technology 25 Aug 2016 Brexit 'opportunism' could save Softbank billions on ARM deal Brexit 'opportunism' could save Softbank billions on ARM deal By James Temperton Softbank 18 Jul 2016 What will doctors of the future look like?

The updated version comes with a small boost, from 2400MHz to 2666MHz. Other than that nothing else has changed. They continue to be available in red, grey, and white, also they come in two sizes, 4GB and 8GB, in single kit, dual kit, and quad kit. You can also still get the 2400MHz RAM. At the time of writing this review the 4x4GB kit will cost you €174 if you live in the EU or 151 US Dollars if you are in the USA.

Last week TAG Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1650 (R21000) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. This week Swatch Group chief executive Officer Nick Hayek also announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers in the middle of the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. Share this story Swatch’s approach differs from LVMH. A staff member of LVMH  demonstrates a new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 model watch after its presentation in Brunnen, Switzerland recently.Photo: Reuters Price They’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers - who often don’t wear any watches, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15000.  Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel - Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines - have stayed out of the smartwatch market. Read also: Swatch takes on Apple, Google The releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont chairperson Johann Rupert has said his brands planned to make only “intelligent watchstraps” and putting electronic functions into the watch case created a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution”. TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1650 that can swop the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Failures Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and last month Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Smartwatches from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17000 luxury version of the Apple Watch, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IDC estimates that 19.8million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a forecast of 28.3million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9percent last year while shipments at Samsung rose 39percent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches last year, says the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19months of declining exports. This week Swatch forecast a rebound in US and European markets. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got less than than 10percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch last year. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he says. Otherwise, they risk lower-priced timepieces undercutting their sales.  Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Disgraced former SABC executive in line for top job 2 Black woman, you're on your own 3 Former Miss SA forces couple to apologise for 'monkey' slur 4 #ORTamboHeist: Lambo owner is no thief, says lawyer 5 PICS: London attack death toll rises to 5 Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Israeli storage and data management solutions company Reduxio Systems has raised $22.5 million of its Series C financing in a round expected to reach $32 million. The round, which was led by London-based C5 Capital, more than doubles the capital invested in the company, and will fund continued innovation and global marketing of Reduxio's software-defined storage platform. RELATED ARTICLES Hybrid storage co Reduxio Systems raises $15m All previous investors, including Jerusalem Venture Partners, Carmel Ventures, Intel Capital and Seagate Technology participated in this financing round. C5’s investment will complement the existing investor group with a specialist focus on cloud infrastructure and cyber security, as well as a strong network that will enhance Reduxio’s growing ecosystem of channel sales and technology partners. Reduxio CEO Mark Weiner, CTO Nir Peleg, and VP R&D Amnon Strasser founded the company in 2012 at the JVP Media Quarter in Jerusalem. The founders are all former employees of storage solutions start-up Exanet, which was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2010, after a dispute between investors. The company has 80 employees of which 50 are in its Israel offices in Petah Tikva. Reduxio also has offices in San Francisco. Weiner said, “The future of data storage and protection lies in delivering high performance, easy-to-use solutions designed for the rapidly coming era of hybrid IT – this is precisely why we started the company. Reduxio’s next generation architecture was purpose-built to address this challenge. Our vision and focus align perfectly with C5’s vision, and we welcome their unique expertise to the Reduxio team. This latest round of funding will allow us to continue our exponential growth to meet the needs of our rapidly growing customer base.” C5 Capital partner and new board member of Reduxio Marcos Battisti said, “Now and again, investors encounter a top team in a new company with the potential to seriously disrupt a market. Reduxio is clearly one of those companies. Reduxio’s technology is reshaping the storage space as we know it. Its software-defined storage technology is built on top of truly unique and ground-breaking IP that provides tangible benefits to on premise, hybrid, and cloud-based customers. Its solution is also being widely seen as one of the key tools to fight the growing threat of ransomware attacks.

Apparently, these ARM chips are quite good at their jobs and Microsoft might try converting entire categories of workloads over. All around the world the tech press has speculated on whether or not Windows on ARM will be showing up in on-premises datacenters. In doing so, they've completely missed the point. Cutting to the heart of it, it doesn't actually matter if Microsoft releases Windows Server for ARM. Windows isn't the future and even Microsoft knows it. The upcoming availability of SQL server on Linux is all the proof we need that the game is over and, in the data centre at least, Microsoft didn't win. Quite frankly, there's nothing wrong with that. Legacy x86 Windows applications have been a millstone around the neck of the entire industry for ages now and its long past time they were relegated to a niche and left to quietly slip away into the night. What's interesting here isn't that Microsoft managed to take its existing code base, strip out some of the cruft and compile it on ARM. What's interesting is what Microsoft's experiment unlocks outside the Windows ecosystem. SBSA The key to the future of ARM servers that came out of the Microsoft ARM reveal is perhaps the most under-reported piece of information from the event. Microsoft's Windows Server for ARM distribution is able to run on both Cavium's ThunderX2 and Qualcomm's Centriq, both 64-bit ARM-compatible SoCs. This is possible because of the Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) specification undertaken by ARM in 2014. This means that - for server-based ARM chips at least - hardware can be talked to using a generic ARM ACPI driver. In essence, we now have ARM chips that have the important bits of standardization that allowed the x86 ecosystem to grow, flourish and dominate the server space. This is huge. SBSA is the real threat to Intel. This is what can and will allow every flavour of Linux, BSD and whatever else to run on ARM CPUs with minimal fuss or headache. SBSA allows for operating systems and advanced ARM hypervisors that can work across platforms provided by multiple vendors. SBSA allows for an entire extended ecosystem of hardware components and peripherals to work with ARM servers without having to go to a vertically integrated monopolist and beg them for inclusion into their ecosystem. Microsoft buying enough ARM servers to start making noises about converting significant portions of their data centre operations over is the match that starts the fire. If hardware suppliers are going to keep making SBSA-based ARM chips, there has to be enough of a market to make it worth their while. Microsoft is an entire hardware market all on its own. Without anyone else jumping in and buying up chips, Microsoft likely consumes enough servers to make it worth these two manufacturers continuing to develop and iterate their products. Of course, Microsoft isn't the only buyer of these chips and they won't be the only one buying in serious bulk either. Beyond Windows If a large enough market for these chips develops to keep chip-makers iterating designs and cranking out wafers then we're off to the races. Windows on ARM in our data centres is simply not required for this SBSA-based ARM chips to be a success. In fact, it may hinder more than it helps. Windows on ARM failed miserably when Microsoft tried to use it with Windows 8. Microsoft envisioned a next-generation operating system free of the cruft of the past, including pesky things like end-user control over their operating system or devices. By naming their first go at modern ARM clients "Windows", however, end users expected all their old applications to work as they did on their x86 PCs. They also expected the same UI, level of control over their OS, so on and so forth. Microsoft's embrace of ARM servers is its opportunity to break from all that. Maybe all it does is release "Windows Server for ARM" and name it something else. Maybe it takes the time to get truly radical and pull one of its experimental post-windows OSes out of mothballs and give the world something worth using. Microsoft's choices regarding Windows 10 have ruined the brand name, and there's no need to carry any baggage or expectations forward to this new platform. Let Microsoft's cloud team have their way and let legacy x86 Windows applications migrate into Microsoft's cloud. They can sit there forever, just like mainframes have in many organizations, and the rest of us can move on. I, for one, hope this is the path it takes. I'm cautiously optimistic that there might even be someone within Microsoft bold enough to suggest it and politically empowered enough not to lose their job for doing so. It will be interesting to see what happens. A similar question hangs over the open source community. Timothy Prickett Morgan at El Reg's sister site The Next Platform reports that the development versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS 7 and Canonical Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 are all certified to run on Qualcomm's Centriq. Presumably, they'll work just fine on systems based on Cavium's ThunderX2 as well. So the Linux portion of this ARM server revolution has already begun. What's unknown is if they'll take this opportunity to start over. It's time for a new generation of servers without the 30-year-old applications or the need to support hardware, drivers and access methods that haven't been used in 30 years. We've been bringing up an entire generation of "web native" developers who are all about writing applications without the crutch of platforms past. Maybe, now that they've cut their teeth on public clouds and containers, they're ready to reinvent our data centres, one ARM at a time. ® Tips and corrections 106 Comments More from The Register Update or shut up: Microsoft's choice for desktop Skypers Mac and Windows Skype users given until March 1st to modernise themselves 57 Comments Microsoft ups Surface slab prices for Brits.

Recently, we reported that Xiaomi is working on its next tablet - Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 for which the company showcased a teaser of its upcoming Mi Pad tablet in the official Taobao pages as well. Now a new report has surfaced online in China which has revealed more details about the upcoming tablet. As per reports, there will be two Mi tablets which are named as Mi Pad 3 and Mi Pad 3 Pro. The Mi Pad 3 tablet will come with a 7.9-inch display with an unknown resolution and will feature 4GB of RAM. For internal memory, the Pad 3 will come in 64GB and 128 GB variants. It will run on Android 7.0 Android Nougat operating system. The report also reveals the expected pricing of the Mi Pad 3. The 64GB variant is expected to be priced at 1299 Yuan which is approximately Rs 12,307 while the 128GB variant is priced at 1599 Yuan which is approximately Rs 15,149.

X Dublin placed 19th in list of world’s ‘smart cities’ Irish capital found to be slowest-moving of major cities compared in bank report Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 05:53 Laura Slattery Congestion: Dublin traffic moves at less than 5.5kph in peak periods, data suggests. Photograph: David Sleator         Dublin ranks 19th in an index of “smart cities” by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which forecasts that the market for “smart” technology and infrastructure used in the world’s most advanced urban areas could expand to $1.6 trillion (€1.49 triliion) by 2020. The market for disruptive technologies in industries from energy to security and mobility is $1 trillion in size today, the bank estimates. The investment bank lists more than 250 publicly quoted companies – including “highly” exposed stocks, such as IBM, Intel and Cisco Systems – that are poised to benefit from the rise of smart cities. In a new report, designed as a “primer” for investors who want to explore smart cities as an investment theme, the bank said it anticipated fast growth for technologies such as 5G telecoms networks, artificial intelligence, building automation, cleantech, cybersecurity, electric and self-driving vehicles, the internet of things, sensors, surveillance and voice assistants. Singapore smartest The report ranks Singapore, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo as the world’s smartest cities, with Dublin sandwiched between Auckland and Sydney in 18th and 20th place. Income varies significantly across the world’s largest 300 metropolitan economies, the report also notes. Dublin ranks 19th in terms of the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, with GDP valued at $63,600 per capita. The Swiss city of Zurich was in first place with a GDP of $82,410 per capita, according to Brookings Institution figures quoted in the report. Dublin also ranks 25th on the UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index, a tool to compare cities “on the prosperity path”. ‘Slower than a horse and cart’ However, the Irish capital is the slowest-moving major city, the report notes, citing INRIX 2016 Traffic Scorecard data that found its traffic moves at just 7.5km per hour during congested periods, with peak hour speeds of 5.5 km per hour, “slower than a horse and cart”. ADVERTISEMENT Some 55 per cent of the world’s population now lives in cities, and this figure is expected to grow to 70 per cent by 2050. Cities themselves are becoming denser. But, as a phenomenon, cities are a mass of contradictions. While urbanisation has been a major positive factor in the economic development of countries, the rise of megacities also poses and exacerbates problems such as air pollution, crime, energy waste, homelessness and traffic congestion. A recent UN-Habitat report also concluded that three-quarters of the world’s cities have higher levels of income inequality than two decades ago.       Topics: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Cisco Systems IBM Intel Dublin(IE) Read More Electric Picnic contributed €36m to Ireland’s economy Warnings as G20 financial leaders drop free-trade pledge Only constant on display from Trump and May is incompetence US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin moves to ease trade fears Scotland’s independence not economically viable this time around An Irish/UK ‘powerhouse plan’ is required in wake of Brexit NTMA raises €500m at cheapest rate ever for Irish bonds Iceland bids farewell to capital controls, says 'hallo' to new risks Will Italy be next to reverse out of the EU?

Follow Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Most Viewed on the Web Popular on Twitter Receive Our Daily Headlines   HOME | Sports (Click here for more) House Intel Committee Chair: No Proof Yet of Trump Campaign Plot with Russia WASHINGTON  The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Devin Nunes, said on Sunday that he has seen no proof of any alleged plot between the election campaign of President Donald Trump and Russia during the run-up to the 2016 vote. In an interview with Fox News, Nunes was asked directly if he had seen any evidence of any collusion between Trumps campaign and the Kremlin with the aim of interfering in the November election to favor the magnate. Ill give you a very simple answer: No, responded Nunes, who added that so far no evidence of collusion has emerged. Nunes remarks come one day before the first public hearing in Congress on alleged Russian interference in the election, in which Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a stunning upset. The hearing will take place before the committee the congressman chairs, and scheduled to testify, among others, is FBI Director James Comey. The House Intel Committee is the body tasked with investigating supposed Russian government interference in the election, and Trump has asked that his claim of alleged illegal wiretapping of him by his predecessor, Barack Obama, also be included in the probe. To date, Nunes and Senate Intelligence Committee leaders have said that they have no evidence that the Obama administration intercepted the communications to and from Trump Tower, where Trump lived and worked during the election campaign. The Department of Justice last Friday delivered a dossier to the House and Senate Intel Committees containing information about Obamas alleged spying on Trump. In that regard, Nunes insisted in his Fox interview that, just as he said some days ago, that he still has seen no evidence of any telephone wiretapping, contrary to Trumps unprecedented and controversial claim. Nevertheless, the president has remained firm in his accusation and on Friday, going so far during a White House press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to repeat it.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

By Ian Allison Updated March 20, 2017 07:21 GMT IBM Blockchain is open for business with the announcement of security enhancements within its cloud environment to coincide with the release of Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0. IBM is also announcing a blockchain-based KYC and digital identity system with SecureKey and a number of Canadian banks, as well as partnership with Beijing Energy-Blockchain Labs to deploy the first carbon assets development platform based on Hyperledger Fabric. The announcements are being made at InterConnect, IBM's annual 20,000-strong cloud and cognitive developer bonanza in Las Vegas. Jerry Cuomo, head of blockchain at IBM, pointed out that blockchain networks were only as safe as the cloud infrastructure they resided on. "For that reason, IBM's High Security Business Network is built on the industry's most secure infrastructure, IBM LinuxONE. "Secure services containers help guard against privileged user threats and tamper-resistant cryptographic keys ensure the highest levels of encryption for sensitive data," he said. A few weeks ago Hyperledger Fabric was promoted by Linux Foundation from incubator state to active state and is now at version 1.0. The IBM Blockchain is being refreshed to include Fabric version 1.0. Cuomo said the High Security Business Network, which underpins the IBM cloud environment, can be thought of as a sub-brand like Intel Inside. He said this can involve physical hardware-based security modules; one of the rules of deployment could be that everyone must keep their crypto keys in a vault, for example. "It's like a handshake. There is a governance rule that says, when you join our network you are going to put your keys here and if your keys aren't in there then you can't run on this network," said Cuomo. In detail, the IBM Blockchain security offering meets the industry's highest Evaluation Assurance Level certification of EAL5+, found in highly regulated industries such as government, financial services and healthcare. It features secure service containers to protect all code throughout the blockchain application, effectively encapsulating the blockchain into a virtual appliance and denying access even to someone with the highest level of security credentials. Tamper-responsive hardware security modules protect encrypted data for storage of cryptographic keys. These modules are certified to FIPS 140-2, the highest level of security certification available for cryptographic modules. Cuomo added: "With some security systems, if you are tampering with the vault it will record it in a log. That's like the lower levels of support. But in the case of higher levels of support, if the system is being tampered with it will shut it down within your environment; it will turn your system into a brick and disable all operation for your piece of the network. "You want to make sure members are using physical security as well, like your software stack won't boot unless it matches a fingerprint of all of the other software stack users in that network. "This is where the cloud can actually help. We are trying to make running blockchain on a cloud more intuitive and actually flip it around and say, you should always run it this way. "It is another dimension to the security model. One is the security of the ledger, and the second is the security of environment in which the ledger is running. We are not leaving any stone unturned." IBM also announced new governance and open-source developer tools for IBM Blockchain that make it easy to set up a blockchain network and assign roles and levels of visibility from a single dashboard. They help network members set rules, manage membership and enforce compliance once the network is up and running. Once setup is initiated, members can determine the rules of the blockchain and share consent when new members requesting to join the network. In addition, the deployment tool assigns each network a Network Trust Rating of 1 to 100. Cuomo said the reputation score will inform prospective members of a network how trustworthy and reliable that network is, and also provides hints about how to make it more trustworthy and reliable. "There will also be policies such as who is allowed to invite new members to come in. One policy is that the founder can have a dictator condition. It can make sense for one company in the business network or a government institution, like a department of motor vehicles, that is more trusted than the others. "Or you may have more democratic policy, so it has to be a majority of the members vote yes. The more democratic your policies, the higher your trust score. It's early days still but these are some of the things we have learned by having some of these real networks running on IBM Blockchain." IBM and SecureKey blockchain identity system IBM Blockchain and SecureKey's digital identity and attribute sharing network, which will go live later in 2017, allows consumers to better control their identifying information and instantly verify their identity for new bank accounts, driver's licences or other utilities, said a statement. The system is being tested by a number of Canadian banks, including BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank and TD. The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) and the Command Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics (CCICADA), are also invested in the project. Reducing carbon emissions in China Beijing Energy-Blockchain Labs and IBM are breaking ground by helping enterprises in China foster carbon asset development, also known as CER (Carbon Emission Reduction) quota issuing. Following a proof of concept in late 2016, a beta version of the carbon trading platform on blockchain will be released in May. Energy-Blockchain Labs and IBM intend to commercially offer this platform later this year, keeping pace with China's unified national carbon market opening. Regarding the Energy-Blockchain Labs project, Cuomo said it was another fortuitous example of the Hyperledger Project's reach in building a worldwide community. "The folks in China they are members of the Hyperledger Project. If it weren't for that, I don't think we'd have ever met them, let alone team up with them to work on a project."

Even before the dust around the disclosures settle down, U.S. companies responded to the data breach, demonstrating their nimbleness and dynamism. The Case In Brief Last week, WikiLeaks released the first part of a series of leaks code named "Vault 7," with the first part termed as "Year Zero." The publisher indicated in the leaks that the CIA had used sophisticated software tools to break into smartphones, computers and TVs. The companies whose products were compromised included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF). Intel Springs Into Action Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s security unit McAfee announced the release a detection tool for EFI rootkits following the WikiLeaks revelation. ICYMI we released a detection tool for EFI rootkits after last week's #WikiLeaks dump. Details here: https://t.co/44GodO19uJ via @pcworld — McAfee (@McAfee) March 15, 2017 A rootkit is a software designed to conceal any compromise on an operating system. It works by empowering the viruses and malware to pose as necessary files, thereby avoiding detection by antivirus software. EFI, or extensible firmware Interface, is a new firmware standard for operating system that supports fast PC startup, bootable GPT hard drive and large capacity more than 2T. It runs before the operating system and initializes the various hardware components during the boot process. Therefore, a malicious program hidden inside the EFI can inject malicious code into the OS kernel, helping to restore any malware removed from the computer, a report in PC World explains. The WikiLeaks disclosure mentioned an OS X implant called DerStarke, which consists of a kernel code injection module called Bokor and an EFI persistence module called DarkMatter. The CIA Embedded Development Branch document leaked by WikiLeaks also refers to another implant called QuarkMatter. Others Scramble To Cover Up A SBS report, quoting Czech anti-virus software maker Avast VP Sinan Eren, said the company had sought from Apple and Google privileged access to their devices to offer fixes for known bugs. "If we can drive a paradigm shift where mobile platforms don't shut off access, we'll be better able to detect when hackers are hiding in a mobile (phone)," Eren was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Apple quickly moved in to quell worries by stating that many of the issues were already patched in the latest iOS. The company also urged its customers to download the latest iOS to ascertain that they have the most recent security update.

Last year, Apple brought the hammer down on the 11-inch MacBook Air, and this year, it appears that the 13.3-inch model might be next. With the MacBook Air series seemingly set to be discontinued, it is pertinent to ask: Is the MacBook Air still a compelling buy? Inasmuch as the Air line is aging fast, there are still three compelling reasons why Apple’s entry-level MacBooks are still a worthy purchase. Incomparable Battery The MacBook Air is the undisputed champion of battery life. The devices’ display, while considered by many to be the Air’s biggest flaw, actually plays in its favor, extending the machine’s already stellar endurance. According to a LaptopMag report, the 13.3-inch MacBook Air’s battery life is practically legendary, reaching north of 12 hours on one charge. In the portable computing market, very few have been able to challenge the Air when it comes to how long it could last away from the power outlet. IdentiMac just decoded a Serial Number for MacBook Air 11" i7 1.7GHz Early 2014 from USA #Apple #MacBookAir #MacOSX https://t.co/AMgOUgd5YQ pic.twitter.com/xjlU3L8hbF — IdentiMac (@IdentiMac) March 8, 2017 Apple has never actually managed to exceed the MacBook Air when it comes to battery life. Even the 12-inch MacBook, which features an almost all-battery design, falls short of the MacBook Air’s endurance. In LaptopMag‘s tests, the 13-inch MacBook Air lasted a full 14 hours on a single charge, while the more updated 12-inch MacBook lasted a humble 9.5 hours. Great Price Apple devices are not cheap, with the firm’s 2016-series laptops such as the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro being priced north of $1,000. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, still maintains its sub-$1,000 price. This gives the laptop great value for money, especially considering that the 12-inch MacBook, which is priced significantly more than the Air, is inferior in power. The entry-level 13.3-inch MacBook Air carries an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, together with 128GB of internal storage. On the other hand, the 12-inch MacBook, which Apple seems to be building up to be the MacBook Air’s successor, sports a rather anemic Intel M processor. For its price, the MacBook Air simply offers more than its successor. Finally!! #blessed #macbookair #apple #happy pic.twitter.com/EhHpWWchhr — Rougzy (@Rougzzy) March 17, 2017 A Dongle-Free Life When the MacBook Pro 2016 was released, numerous Apple fans and critics noted that the device’s lack of ports would result in a dongle nightmare for users of the machine. True enough, the absence of simple ports such as an SD card reader and a Thunderbolt port forced MacBook Pro 2016 users to invest in various dongles. The MacBook Air does not have this problem, as the device still carries practically all the legacy ports that users would need to hook up their machines to external displays, digital cameras, and other peripherals. Apple’s insistence on the exclusive use of USB-C has polarized even Apple’s most dedicated fans. After all, it appears that convenience and practicality-wise, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s devices seem to be taking a step backwards. With the MacBook Air, however, users could rest assure that they could enjoy the full features of their laptops without having to commit to dozens of dongles. If Apple’s 2016 laptops are any indication, the MacBook Air is on its way out, according to a MacWorld report. Despite this, however, the device remains one of Apple’s most practical products, featuring capable internals at a rather reasonable price. The 13.3-inch MacBook Air currently sells for $999 on Apple’s website, but third-party retailers sell the device for just around $899. During sales, the MacBook Air becomes even more affordable, mostly being priced at just $799.

Evolution Media China and Shenzhen Capital Group Co Ltd led the round. PRESS RELEASE Shenzhen, China, March 16, 2017 – Makeblock Co., Ltd, the STEM education and robotics startup, today announced it has closed a $30 million Series B round at a $200 million valuation led by Evolution Media China and Shenzhen Capital Group Co., Ltd. The new investment brings Makeblock’s total funding to over $36 million. The funding supports Makeblock’s expansion into new markets, as well as further product development and diversification of STEM education hardware, software and curriculum resources for educators, children and hobbyists. With the infusion of capital, Makeblock will expand its global footprint with new offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, North America, Japan, and the Netherlands. Currently, Makeblock is available in more than 140 countries with 1,600 channel partners, and 20,000 schools and educational organizations implementing Makeblock’s products into their educational curriculum. “We’re excited to support Makeblock at this pivotal point in their growth as they continue to elevate STEM education to a new level” said Jason Ding, President at Evolution Media China. “STEM education is the next industry to experience deep disruption, following in the footsteps of the mobile, IoT and virtual reality industries. Over the past few years, Makeblock has been leading the charge in creating practical products for STEM education in the classroom and at home, and we believe this is just the beginning of their path to transforming education.” Since 2016, Makeblock experienced significant growth, expanding its workforce to over 300 employees worldwide. Makeblock will use this latest round of funding to invest in further STEM/STEAM education distribution, global expansion, and the development of new initiatives built upon its most recent work with Microsoft, Intel and beyond. The company will also be expanding its retail reach in the coming months, deepening its partnership with Barnes & Noble and SoftBank to put Makeblock products in more stores across the globe. “Creation is happening everywhere at an explosive rate. From schools using Makeblock to teaching STEM concepts, to tech giants like Microsoft, Intel, Apple Education tapping Makeblock to unleash creativity in the classroom, down to parents at home trying to aid in their child’s education, the true power of Makeblock as a platform is to inspire creation,” said Founder and CEO Jasen Wang, “Our goal is to get Makeblock in every school, every home, every creative space to give anyone, at any age the ability to be a creator or inventor.” In addition to international expansion, the funding will support the launch of Makeblock’s first annual robotics competition later in 2017, which will encourage students to compete with their creative projects using Makeblock’s construction platform.

(pictured in February 2016), doesn't expect bombshells or deeply classified information to emerge from Monday’s long-awaited House Intelligence panel hearing into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. | Sun-Times file photo Lynn Sweet @lynnsweet | email Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up Follow @lynnsweet Don’t expect big bombshells or deeply classified information to emerge from Monday’s long-awaited House Intelligence panel hearing into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election — and other related possible spying. That’s according to Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., the only member from Illinois on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which is holding its first hearing about Russia’s role in the 2016 contest. FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers will testify on-the-record under oath starting at 9 a.m. Chicago time as President Donald Trump deplores as “fake news” stories suggesting potential links between people in the Trump orbit and Russia. I caught up with Quigley on Sunday on what might occur at the Monday session as he was boarding a plane to fly from Chicago to Washington. Quigley has been on the Intel panel for two-and-a-half years. The potentially sprawling congressional probe is “far more extensive than people are imagining,” Quigley told me. OPINION Follow @lynnsweet He said the most important question to ask is “was there collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians?” Quigley said Russians should be taken in the broad sense — the official Russian government and other actors. QUIGLEY’S OTHER TAKES . . . On whether secrets will be revealed on Monday: “It’s important to say this. This is an open hearing (in contrast to closed sessions where classified material is discussed) so these guys aren’t going to reveal some big secret. “This is an ongoing investigation. It’s going to be awhile and I suspect that what we are going to see Monday is more of a framing of this — the scope of the investigation rather than some earth-shattering thing.” At the most, what might be learned on Monday? “You will see Comey rebut the notion of wiretapping of Trump Tower,” the allegation Trump made in a series of tweets two weeks ago. The chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has said there is no evidence of a Trump Tower wiretap. Quigley agrees with the GOP chairman on this one. GOP focus at the hearing: Republicans “will focus their concerns about leaks” surfacing in news stories about the Russians and the election. Quigley’s best guess: The GOP members may go down the road of pushing Comey and Rogers to explain “How do these leaks happen? How are we investigating them and how do we prevent them in the future? Democratic focus: Democrats’ lines of inquiry will be about Russian’s possible collusion with “with the Trump political campaign and how do we prevent this from happening in the future.” “. . . You will see individual members from the Democratic side focus on individuals involved with this issue.” Those in the Trump orbit: Democrats likely will raise questions about Russian links and could include, Quigley said, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former NSA chief Mike Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Quigley’s bottom line: “I am just looking for a thorough, thoughtful, bipartisan, bicameral investigation that gets to the facts wherever they lead us.” “. . . There is a lot of work involved, but we are going to get to the bottom of this.” The Senate Intelligence Committee, also run by Republicans, is also looking into the matter of Russian interference in the election. Does Quigley know secrets? “I suspect everyone on the Intelligence Committee has been briefed on things that are not publically known.” Tweets by @lynnsweet # House Intelligence hearing U.S. Rep.

Photo: CFP  Students from a rural primary school in East China's Jiangsu Province won the qualification to participate in the final of a robotics competition in Columbia, but they could not afford the costs for attending the event. The school decided to give up the opportunity on Tuesday, after local education authorities noted that robotic competition is not a project that they could support. The incident shows that disparities between rural and urban education still exist, experts said, and the country has vowed to bridge the gap. Lack of funding The team of four students from Jing'an Primary School in Rudong county, Jiangsu, won the first place in robot jousting in RoboRAVE Asia 2017, which was held in Beijing in February, Jiangsu-based Modern Express newspaper reported on March 12. They beat rivals from professional clubs and elite schools in big cities of countries like China, Japan and India. "I just wanted to broaden the children's horizon … and never thought we could win a place in the final," said Wang Yafei, a mathematics teacher in the school who was leading the team. RoboRAVE Asia 2017 is part of Intel's RoboRAVE, an International robotics competition for teams of students from elementary school, high school and beyond high school to test their design skills in one or more events, according to the competition's official website. Winners of RoboRAVE Asia would be qualified to attend the RoboRAVE International 2017 to be held in Medellin, Colombia in May. However, the Jing'an students have to give up the opportunity to attend the event in Colombia because their school and families could not afford the cost - 43,000 yuan ($6,235) for each child, said the Modern Express. The report soon sparked heated discussion online, with many people appealing to the authorities to help fulfill the dream of the children. However, on March 13, the Rudong educational bureau said that the competition was not on the list of "competitions high school and primary school students could participate" released by the Jiangsu provincial education department in 2017. "As we neither approved nor agreed with them joining (this competition), how can we support them financially?" a Rudong educational official told thepaper.cn on Tuesday. Passion for science It was not the first time that the robotics teams in Jing'an had won the first place in national or international competitions, nor the first time they had to give up the chance to go further. Jing'an High School has given up the chance to join the RoboRAVE International twice, the Modern Express reported. "We have become used to that," Yuan Xiao, a teacher from Jing'an High School, told the newspaper. According to the Modern Express, the robotics society in Jing'an Primary School was founded in 2015 by Wang. Now the society has more than 20 children who attend trainings on Friday and Sunday. The costs for joining the competitions in the past years were mainly covered by students' parents. But this time, 43,000 yuan is roughly equal to the annual income of a village family, according to the Modern Express. Jing'an Primary School's case also highlights the imbalance in the education resources available in rural and urban areas, Hu Xingdou, a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday. China will carry out reforms to integrate compulsory education in urban and rural areas and improve education in rural areas, according to a circular issued by the State Council in July 2016. The reforms are set to reduce educational gap between urban and rural areas and coordinate compulsory education with urbanization at the county level by 2020, further improving the quality and balance in compulsory education, according to the website of the Chinese government. "It is a great pity these rural students cannot fulfill their wish. China has vowed to build a creative nation, and the key is to foster the creativity of children," Hu said. "It is not to say that the education department should pay for any interest of students, but robots and artificial intelligence have become the trend of science and technology education globally, which could change the world, so the government should support these kinds of projects," Hu noted. | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland also blocked the latest travel ban, which was due to begin midnight on Thursday. President Trump has called this ruling “unprecedented judicial overreach”. Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism While it is unlikely that Apple, Google or other tech companies are more favorable to the second travel ban considering how heavily they rely on immigrants, none of the companies responded to a Reuters’ query on why they have chosen not to sign the latest brief.

Here is the latest from the annual Mobile World Congress hosted in Barcelona. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 19, 2017 at 5:21PM In February, over 2,300 companies showed up at Mobile World Congress 2017. The annual event, hosted by the GSM Association (a trade organization for mobile operators), is an opportunity for the wireless and tech community to showcase its best ideas. Here were five of this year's high points. Nokia phones 3.0 Wireless connections have become the driving force behind many of today's biggest innovations. It is ironic, then, that one of the big hits at MWC this year was a dead-but-resuscitated favorite from the past. Image source: Nokia. Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which primarily concerns itself these days with wireless network services, has licensed out its phone business to HMD Global. The start-up phone maker released a revamped 3310 "dumbphone," which was a staple in its early 2000s heyday but went by the wayside when smartphones became a thing. The new 3310 will purportedly have the same near-indestructible build as the original but sport a color screen instead of the original monochrome display. It's a no-frills option the phone maker hopes will find a niche in today's fancy-smartphone market. The Nokia name will also be featured on three affordably priced smartphones the company is trying to market on its own. After Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) failed in revitalizing Nokia phones a few years ago, maybe this time things will be different. 360-degree camera action MWC 2017 also had its fair share of new smartphone previews. One of them, built by the obscure company Protruly of China, was touted as the world's first "virtual reality" phone and has a 360-degree camera built in. How does it work? Two fisheye lenses are built into the top, one mounted to the front and one at the back. Users can preview recordings taken on the phone in sphere-shaped videos and then quickly upload them to sites like YouTube. The phone is not for sale outside China right now, but it presents a unique feature that is worth monitoring for popularity. Samsung battles the Microsoft Surface Image source: Samsung. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) delayed unveiling its new Galaxy 8 phone. On display instead was a new tablet designed to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft's Surface series. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft's Surface sales increased by $486 million, a 13% increase over the previous year. Samsung would like to take a chunk out of that nearly $4 billion business, and its new Galaxy Book could do that as it sports similar looks and features to the Surface. The devices are still a win for Microsoft, though, as Samsung Books will use Windows 10 as an operating system. Whether it's a Galaxy Book or Surface sale, the popularity of "tablets that replace your laptop" earns Microsoft revenue either way. Technology for blue-collar workers A lot of attention has been given to virtual reality the last few years, but most estimates anticipate augmented reality to be the bigger market. This is because of the possible applications in the workplace, everything from digital workstations to data visualization. Image source: DAQRI. Enter the company DAQRI, which showcased its smart helmet at MWC. The helmet was designed with industrial workers in mind and has the ability to overlay everything from data to thermal vision onto the wearer's view of the real world. The device is powered by an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processor and uses input from multiple sensors, including a basic camera, an infrared camera, and a thermal scale camera. It puts on display Intel's work in the augmented- and merged-reality space, and gives us a glimpse into what future workplaces could look like -- at least workplaces requiring a hard hat. A self-driving race car A company called Roborace showed up with the world's first driverless electric race car. The futuristic machine was built to compete in Formula E, a new all-electric racing circuit started a few years ago, but the company hopes that one day autonomous racing will be a thing. In Robocar, it's all about the tech. Instead of a driver and a pit crew, there is a computer programmed by a team of techies. Roborace is using NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips as the brain powering its vehicles. Image source: Roborace. Car races have a long history of being the testing ground for features we now take for granted while driving. Things like disc brakes, rearview mirrors, and push-button ignition all got their start on the track. Roborace sees its autonomous racers helping develop future autonomous cars for the general public. The information learned can help automakers and tech companies like NVIDIA home in on what works best for cars of the future. Mobile World Congress has developed into more than a show for phones and mobile providers; it's a venue for companies that rely on wireless tech to show off their latest developments. Investors can watch the action to see what's the future might look like.  Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Eurotech’s Intel Atom E3800 “Bay Trail” based CPU-163-15 COM Express Type 10 Mini computer-on-module continues the Amaro, Italy based company’s tradition of offering rugged embedded boards with support for its cloud-based Everyware Software Framework (ESF) IoT platform. Other recent Intel-based COM Express modules from Eurotech include the CPU-161-18, a headless COM Express Type 6 Compact module with a 12-core Xeon-D1500 from the Broadwell generation. Like the CPU-161-18, the CPU-163-15 runs Yocto Project based Linux and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. It also similarly supports Eurotech’s ESF, a commercial, enterprise-ready edition of Eclipse Kura, an open source Java/ OSGi middleware for IoT gateways. CPU-163-15 (click image to enlarge) In the past, Eurotech’s COMs primarily used its proprietary, 100 x 67mm Small Form Factor (SFF) format, such as the similarly Intel Atom E3800 driven Catalyst BT. More recently, however, it has focused more on COM Express. Eurotech gives you a choice of the single-core, 1.46GHz Atom E3815 (5W consumption) or dual-core, 1.75GHz Atom E3827 (8W), both of which are supported with 2GB of soldered, 1066MHz DDR3L-ECC. You can also choose a quad-core, 1.91GHz Atom E3845, which clocks to 1.91GHz. This 10W model ships with 4GB of soldered, 1333MHz DDR3L-ECC. All three models supply 8GB to 32GB of soldered eMMC. The single-core E3815 model supports extended -20 to 70°C temperatures while the dual- and quad-core SKUs can live in the fully industrial -40 to 85°C range. All other features are consistent across the board. The product page formatting suggests the quad-core model lacks the dual SATA 2.0 ports, but the datasheet identifies the interface is available for all three SKUs. The CPU-163-15 offers a GbE controller with integrated transceiver, as well as a USB 3.0 interface and 8x USB 2.0 (4x native, 4x via USB HSIC). You get a DDI interface with support for up to 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz using HDMI or DVI, and up to 2560 x 1600 @ 60Hz for DisplayPort. There’s also an 18/24-bit, single-channel LVDS connection for up to 1366 x 768 @ 60Hz. The module is further equipped with dual serial interfaces, 8-bit DIO, HD audio, and I2C. Expansion buses include LPC, SMBus, and 3x PCIe x1. There’s a watchdog and support for RTC, as well as a factory option for TPM. The module supports 4.75V to 20V input in ATX or AT modes. Eurotech provides customization services including BIOS personalization, carrier board design, system development, and production.   Further information The CPU-163-15 is available now at an undisclosed price. More information may be found on Eurotech’s CPU-163-15 product page. At Embedded World this week, Eurotech is showcasing both the CPU-163-15 and its recent, Xeon-D based CPU-161-18. It also announced the development of a new i.MX6-based Pico-ITX SBC, which is due by the end of Q3 2017.   Related posts: Rugged module runs Yocto Linux on up to 12-core Xeon-D Atom-based gateway taps new open source IoT cloud platform Kura-based Linux IoT framework adds multi-cloud support ARM Linux IoT gateway offers cloud services support ARM-based IoT gateway kit includes PLC and demo board Wireless-enabled i.MX6 SBC offers remote IoT management Tiny COM Express module runs Linux on quad-core Atom Tiny μQseven module aims Bay Trail Atoms at IoT Tiny COM features Apollo Lake and soldered RAM Tough, expandable Bay Trail SBC measures just 95 x 55mm (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Freedman | March 15, 2017 MORE $799.99 Editors' rating: The Pros Responsive keyboard; Strong speakers; Above-average battery life The Cons Bland display; Tons of bloatware; Few good storage options Verdict The Acer Aspire VX 15 is a solid budget gaming laptop, but it suffers from a poor screen and too little storage. Review Yes, it's true: For less than $1,000, you can play your favorite games at 1080p. The Acer Aspire VX 15 (reviewed at its starting price of $799.99) is a budget gaming laptop with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU and a Core i5-7300HQ CPU. This attractive, 15-inch gaming rig also features a snappy keyboard, good audio output and strong performance for the money, but to get it at this price, you have to compromise on screen quality and internal storage. article continued below Design Though I usually find the red-and-black color scheme on gaming laptops to be a bit of a clich&#233;, the Aspire VX 15's look is subtle enough that I find it handsome. The lid is made of black plastic with a faux-brushed-aluminum pattern, and features Acer's logo in silver and two red stripes. The silver hinge reads "Aspire VX" and is flanked by two red vents that would look at home on a Transformer. When I lifted the lid, I found the 15.6-inch, 1080p display; an island-style keyboard complete with a number pad; and the touchpad. There are a few more red trimmings here, including on the A, S, D and W keys as well as the touchpad's border. At 15.3 x 10.5 x 1.1 inches and 5.4 pounds, the Aspire VX 15 is slightly larger than competitors but also a little bit lighter. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is 15.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches and 5.8 pounds, and the Asus ROG Strix GL553VD is 15.1 x 10 x 1.2 inches and 5.6 pounds. On the left side of the laptop, you'll find a lock slot, a USB 2.0 port, an SD card reader and a combination headphone/microphone jack. On the right are a USB Type-C 3.1 port, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI output port and an Ethernet jack. MORE: A Guide to Computer Ports and Adapters Display The VX 15's 15.6-inch, 1080p screen is sharp, but its colors are bland and lifeless. When I watched the latest trailer for Wonder Woman, the skies and seas of Themyscira did not appear as two distinct, vivid shades of blue, but rather one pale shade of cyan. While the green grass that Diana tramples as she trains is sharp (you can see the individual blades), it didn't look rich and full of life. When I stormed a beach in Battlefield 1, the craggy rocks were sharp, and I could see the sparks emanating from fires and pistols, but the scene was slightly darker than it should have been. The Aspire's panel reproduces just 65 percent of the sRGB color gamut, falling far behind the 96-percent sRGB average. That's a worse range than on the Inspiron's dull display (67 percent), but the Strix was far superior (122 percent). The screen's colors are not accurate, either. The Aspire got a Delta-E score of 6.8 in our testing (0 is ideal). While the Inspiron was much less precise (12), the Aspire scored much worse than  the category average (2.4) and the Strix (1.6). To top it all off, the Aspire's screen is relatively dim, measuring just 247 nits on our light meter. That's lower than the average (271 nits), the Inspiron (253 nits) and the Strix (269 nits). Keyboard and Touchpad The VX 15's keyboard is responsive and comfortable. With its 1.6 millimeters of travel and 65 grams of force required to press the keys, I found that the backlit keys (just red, no RGB here) struck a solid balance that made sure I rarely bottomed out. I reached 115 words per minute (the high end of my average range) on the 10fastfingers.com typing test with my usual error rate of 2 percent. The 4.1 x 3-inch touchpad is smooth and responsive, and it works with Windows 10's precision gestures. Besides pinching-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling, I switched between apps with three finger side swipes and opened the Action Center with a four-finger tap. Audio When I listened to White Rabbits' "Percussion Gun" on the VX 15, the drummers practically reached out and punched me in the face. The speakers are surprisingly powerful and well-balanced. The song's namesake percussion is loud and strong, while the vocals, keys and rhythmic hand claps were equally clear and loud. It easily filled our small conference room with sound. The drums on White Rabbits' 'Percussion Gun' practically reached out and punched me in the face. When I played Battlefield 1, I could clearly hear the thud of cannonballs landing on a sandy beach as my fellow soldiers shouted over the chaos. Despite all of that, I could still make out the orchestrated music in the background. Gaming, Graphics and VR The Aspire rocks an Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU with 4GB of VRAM, which is enough to play your favorite games at 1080p, although not on the highest settings (and definitely not in VR). I fired up Battlefield 1 and stormed the beaches of Gallipoli at high settings between 33 and 43 frames per second. When I moved the settings down to medium, I reached a more consistent 57 to 60 fps. On our budget gaming test, in which we run Rise of the Tomb Raider at high settings with SMAA anti-aliasing at 1080p, the Aspire reached 43 fps, surpassing the Strix and the mainstream notebook average (both 38 fps). But when we ran our regular Rise of the Tomb Raider test, the Aspire choked at an unplayable 16 fps. The Inspiron (22 fps) and the Strix (18 fps) weren't much better. The average is 32 fps, though that includes laptops with stronger GPUs. (Both the Strix and the Inspiron also have Nvidia GTX 1050 GPUs.) Performance Armed with a 2.5-GHz Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive, the Aspire VX 15 is no slouch when it comes to performance. I had 40 tabs open in Google Chrome, including one streaming an episode of Last Week Tonight, at 1080p on YouTube, and I didn't experience any lag at all. However, the Aspire earned a score of 7,898 on the Geekbench 4 overall performance test, falling far below the mainstream notebook average (11,235), the Inspiron (10,363, Core i5-7300HQ) and the Strix (12,253, Core i7-7700HQ). The Aspire took 49 seconds to copy 4.97GB of mixed media files, which is faster than the average (1:10) and the Strix (0:54). The Inspiron 15 was one second faster (0:48). It took the Aspire 3 hours and 39 seconds to pair 20,000 names and addresses in our OpenOffice Spreadsheet macro test. Both the Inspiron (3:37) and the Strix (3:31) were a hair faster, but all three were speedier than the category average (4:15). Battery Life For a gaming notebook, the Aspire VX 15 has solid endurance. It lasted 7 hours and 8 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi.  MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life The category average is a slightly lower 6:59. The Strix fell far short (3:41), but the Inspiron had far better endurance (11:23). Heat During regular use, the Aspire stayed nice and cool in our testing. After streaming HD video from YouTube for 15 minutes, the Aspire measured 94 degrees Fahrenheit on the bottom, 88 degrees between the G and H keys, and 79 degrees on the touchpad. But when I booted up Battlefield 1, the computer heated up. As I battled to take the beaches of Gallipoli, the bottom climbed to 111 degrees and the center of the keyboard reached 105.5 degrees, but the touchpad stayed cool, at 81.5 degrees. Webcam The 720p webcam on the Aspire VX 15 is pretty standard for a laptop camera. In a photo I shot at my desk, I appeared slightly blurry, and my beard looked like it had been  drawn on with a Sharpie. But you could make out all of my facial features, and the gray stripes on my black shirt were clear enough. You should get an external webcam for Twitch streaming, but this is good enough for Skyping with your pals. Software and Warranty The Aspire VX 15 is jam-packed with software, and although a few of them are useful utilities from Acer, the rest is junk you'll want to delete ASAP. Acer's apps include abFiles and abPhotos to access your content from any connected device, as well as Quick Access to turn on features such as Bluelight Shield and Color Intelligence. There's also a ton of bloat, including eBay, Priceline, Netflix, Kindle, the Acer collection (links to download more partner software), WildTangent games and Dashlane. Even Firefox is preinstalled. That's on top of the usual crap that comes with Windows 10, including Candy Crush Soda Saga, Facebook, Twitter and Royal Revolt 2. Acer sells the Aspire VX 15 with a one-year warranty. See how the company performed on our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands ranking. Configurations Our $800 review configuration of the Acer Aspire VX 15 came with a 2.5-GHz Intel Core i5-7300HQ CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU with 4GB of VRAM. It's hard to recommend this particular configuration because of its limited storage space. That 256GB SSD will be filled after installing just a handful of games. Gamers who buy any model with only an SSD can open it up and add a 2.5-inch HDD, but they'll have to buy that drive separately. Additionally, they will also need to fill out an online form for a complimentary mounting kit, which comes with a 2.5-inch bracket, a SATA cable and eight screws, so there's some assembly required. For $1,000, you can get a version with an intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and the GTX 1050. This has the same storage limitations as our review model. There are two options at $1,050. The first is the same as the $1,000 model, except it swaps out the GTX 1050 for the more powerful GTX 1050 Ti. You'll get better graphics but will still have limited storage. The other option at this price uses the regular GTX 1050 and includes a 1TB HDD. It's not as fast as an SSD, but you'll be able to install far more games straight out of the box. Bottom Line The Acer Aspire VX 15 is a solid budget gaming notebook despite its rock-bottom price of $800, but the corners it cut to get to that price are quite annoying. The screen is dull, and there's just not enough room to hold a lot of games until you get to a more expensive configuration (unless you send away for a mounting kit and buy another drive). However, it lasts long for a gaming notebook, has a comfortable keyboard and even looks spiffy. If you have more money to spend, consider the $1,099 Asus ROG Strix GL553VD, which has a superior screen and better storage options, and starts with a faster processor, although the speakers and battery life aren't as good. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 also starts at $799, lasts much longer on a charge and has more configuration options, but its screen is even blander than the Aspire's. Overall, the Aspire VX 15 is a strong choice if you need a gaming rig and can't afford to spend more than $1,000.

WD made the fundamental leap in 2015 with the announcement that they would purchase flash memory giant Sandisk. This transformed WD into a storage powerhouse with a product portfolio able to compete with anyone in the market. Here for review we have one of the fruits of the new Western Digital: the WD Blue 1Tb SSD. Rather than go all out and instantly try to compete with performance oriented NVMe drives like the Samsung 950/960 Pro series or Intel 750, WD instead went with the more value oriented SATA interface, aiming to offer a value drive in 250Gb, 500Gb and 1Tb capacities that will be equally at home in modest consumer systems, laptop upgrades or as a HDD replacing storage solution for enthusiasts. WD’s drive line up follows the same recognizable segmentation as their HDD range, denoted by their Green, Blue, Black etc product branding.   Specifications Here are the specifications straight from WD. While the drive we have on hand is the 2.5″ variety, there are also M.2 versions available in the 2280 form factor. As is typical with SSD, the larger capacity drives have slightly higher performance levels that are typically bottlenecked by the SATA interface in all but the cheapest 2017 era SSD’s. The warranty is 3 years (limited) which is probably a little lower than we’d like given the very good endurance rating. A Closer Look There’s not much to talk about regarding the box.   The box contains the drive itself in a plastic shell. There is nothing else included.     SSD’s are hardly the most attractive PC parts. We appreciate SSD’s more for their beautiful performance instead of their aesthetics. Now that we think about it.. will we ever see RGB SSD’s? It’s only a matter of time since we all know RGB makes things go faster…. On the rear we have all the model information as well as regulatory approvals.       Here is the PCB of the WD 1Tb Blue SSD.   The single sided PCB is cooled by this metal lid with a thermal pad that makes contact with all the key components.   A Marvell 88SS1074 controller powers the WD Blue SSD. This is an off the shelf controller used by many vendors in their value SSD ranges. It supports a wide rand of NAND packages. One of the key features is support for a deep sleep mode which reduces idle power into the low mW range. This is a useful feature for laptops and battery life.   The cache is made up of two of these Micron 512Mb DDR3 DRAM chips.   There are a total of 8 128Gb TLC NAND packages populating the PCB. This gives a total of 1024Gb, meaning there is a 24Gb of reserve area Interestingly, WD rates the 1Tb Blue SSD as having a 400 TBW (terabytes written)  endurance rating. This is a very competitive rating and means the WD drive should be well suited to heavy workloads and a theoretical long lifetime.   Test Setup and Benchmarks     Anvil is a great SSD test because it tests not only transfer performance, but adds IOPS and access times too. The overall score puts it in the middle of the pack as far as TLC results go.   AS-SSD performance is about right where we’d expect it to be for a modern TLC NAND SSD, thought he 4K read and write is a little lower than we’d like it to be, this isn’t a problem ans the overall score is still 1177 which only the top drives like the Samsung 850 Pro series beat.   ATTO Disk Benchmark a old benchmark and shows the drives peak performance specifications. Here we see the drive max out the SATA bus which is typical for modern SATA SSD’s   CrystalDiskMark shows similar maximum SATA speed in the sequential reading with 553MB/s read and 525MB/s write.  We are impressed with the 4K read and write results . Though we are not focusing on comparisons here due to only having smaller (and generally lesser performing) drives on hand, we will say that the 4K read results is the fastest we have tested.   Conclusion Performance wise, the 1Tb WD Blue SSD performed well though unspectacular. SATA SSD’s are quickly losing ground to NVMe drives as the preferred choice for a OS drive.  Of course WD also cater to the NVMe market and we’d definitely like to get one of their Black SSD’s to test out. As it stands, the WD Blue SSD provides solid, though unspectacular performance in a highly competitive space. This makes value a significant weighting in our recommendation. At the time of writing, Newegg is selling the WD Blue 1tb for just $260, making it one of the cheapest 2.5″ 1Tb SSD’s available. If you can find the WD Blue SSD on sale or discounted, then it’s a no brainer. The drive’s 3 year warranty is not exceptional, though with a 1.75M hour mean time before failure, we hope that the drive will last a few hundred years before needing to worry about it! An endurance rating of 400 Terabyte writes is also very strong and should inspire confidence in the longevity of the drive. If you need the capacity in a notebook, you will be well served by the performance/price ratio as well as the low power usage. We can also see this drive being a very good choice for something like a Steam game library in conjunction with a small capacity NVMe drive as the primary C drive. Though using a SSD a a storage drive is not the most economical route, it sure is a fast and quiet one and one that many enthusiasts would be happy to use it for. With the price dropping steadily, it is now one of the best value drives available and we have no hesitation in recommending the WD Blue 1TB SSD.     Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post To keep up with demand, Nintendo is doubling production of the Switch Tags © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. Trending: Pep Guardiola’s Bizarre Claim After Liverpool Draw The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Mar 20, 2017 - Page 15　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Israeli tech firms revved up about driverless cars ‘START-UP NATION’:Israel has long touted its high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, often powered by veterans of murky technology units in the military AP, JERUSALEM As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel Corp’s more than US$15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye NV last week. Israel is now home to hundreds of start-ups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. The Israeli “smart” transportation sector has attracted about US$4 billion in investment over the past four years, about half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze Inc, said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. During that time, the number of Israeli start-ups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to more than 500. Virtually every major automaker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the nation regularly. General Motors Co has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault SA and Daimler AG are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Subaru, BMW AG, Mazda Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co, Volvo Car Corp and Audi AG are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract more than 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, Zeno-Zamansky said. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Economy said. Israel has long billed itself as a “start-up nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the automotive field, Granoff said. However, there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies are not certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle local traffic customs. Also, no one knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or if humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising are otonomo, which allows automakers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital partner Levy Raiz said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries such as cybersecurity and medical devices. However, he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector, but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2960 times.

Also in the news was the embarrassing comportment of the U.S. executive in chief when he met with the German head of state. Academia was on the hot seat, with accusations of sucking up to right-wing climate change deniers, and autonomous driving was all the talk, with Intel and MobilEye coming to terms on a new merger. Here are those stories and more in our Gas2 Week in Review. Electric Car Road Trip Causes Angst For Chevy Bolt Owner On a recent 800 mile road trip, Chevy Bolt owner, Dawn Hall spent more hours on the road and more expenses on electricity than she would have spent for gasoline for the same trip in a conventional car. The culprits? Difficulty in finding and connecting to chargers, plus some associated parking charges. Hall’s regular commute is about 100 miles, with occasional family visits often adding another 60 miles to her daily mileage total. Charging her electric vehicle overnight generally takes care of all those daily electric vehicle needs. But in one recent trip, Hall had to reroute to available charging stations and open an EVgo account because her ChargePoint membership didn’t offer charging stations where she needed them. Cities Dangle $10 Billion EV Order In Front Of Automakers If the U.S. government is backing away from alternative transportation incentives, many states are not. Thirty U.S. cities have announced that they will purchase full or partial electric vehicles totalling $10 billion— if automakers will provide increase production to meet the state demands for electric vehicles. “If you build it, we will buy it,” says Chris Bast, Seattle’s climate and transportation policy adviser. The electric vehicle offer from the cities comprises automobiles, light duty trucks, street sweepers, trash haulers, and fire trucks, totaling 114,000 electric or hybrid vehicles. That’s more than 70% of all electric vehicles sold last year. Angela Merkel, Three German CEOs Met With Trump On Friday. It Wasn’t Pretty President Donald Trump refused to shake hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a press ceremony, even after a reporter prodded him to do so. The first joint appearance for the U.S. and German leaders took place on March 17 and included CEOs of three major German corporations. Topics on the table included a proposed 35% tax on cars BMW plans to build at a new factory in Mexico. Recently, a senior U.S. administration official huffed that Germany is benefiting unfairly from a weak Euro. “The accusations of President Donald Trump and his advisers are plucked out of thin air,” the president of Germany’s VDMA engineering industry association, Carl Martin Welcker, said in a statement on Monday. Climate Change Studies By Academia Paid For By Fossil Fuel Industry Many of the U.S. top universities are little more than shills for fossil fuel companies, and the white papers they release about climate change incorporate one-dimensional literature reviews that favor climate denial. According to a newly released report, energy companies are using a model developed by the tobacco industry to flood academia with enormous amounts of money to fund energy and climate change research, so much so that impartiality has been lost. The authors say the problem is endemic throughout academia. MIT’s chairman told the Boston Globe, “I don’t see a conflict.” Intel Buys MobilEye For $15.3 Billion At at time in which computers and cars are in convergence mode, Intel has agreed to purchase Israel-based MobilEye for $15.3 billion. MobilEye was deeply involved with the development of the original all-electric Tesla Autopilot until a driver death while using the technology in his electric vehicle caused the Tesla/ MobilEye relationship to collapse. The Intel/ MobilEye transaction is expected to close in about nine months. Until recently, MobilEye has relied on chips manufactured by European chip maker STMicroelectronics but intends to use Intel’s fifth generation chips in the autonomous driving system it is developing for BMW.

TrendsViral Trump took the lightning round quiz as he appeared on the Fox News show Watters World, which aired Saturday night. Host Jesse Watters put a number of famous names to the president, asking him to give his personal opinion on the well known figures ranging from politicians to news channel chiefs. READ MORE: ‘No evidence’ yet of Trump campaign contacts with Russia – House Intel Committee Chair  Trump, whose alleged relationship with the Russian president has come under major public scrutiny, said he didn’t know Putin, “but certainly he is a tough cookie.” “I don’t know how he’s doing for Russia, we’re going to find out one day I guess,” the US leader added. Trump, as usual, didn’t mince words when it came to describing those who don’t quite see eye to eye with him. The first word that came to his mind when asked about his former rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, was simply “disappointed.” VIDEO: #Clinton comeback? Hillary declares she’s ‘ready to come out of the #woods’ https://t.co/sMoIwmygR3pic.twitter.com/15Kkbfe017— RT (@RT_com) March 18, 2017 However, he had a lot more to say when asked about a possible future rival, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been very vocal in her criticism of Trump. “I think she’d lose so badly,” he said, adding that it would be a dream come true if she ran against him. He also blamed her “anger” for damaging Clinton’s presidential chances, and made reference to the Native American figure Pocahontas. “Pocahontas would not be proud of [Warren] as her representative, believe me.” Trump repeatedly used the name as a dismissive moniker for Warren in reference to her claim of Native American ancestry Rapper Snoop Dogg also came under the president’s fire for a music video he produced, depicting himself pointing a toy gun at the head of a Trump-like clown character. Trump said it was a terrible thing to do to any president or person, describing it as a publicity stunt from someone whose “career is failing.” Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama?

The research, conducted by Dr. Sigal Ribon of the Bank of Israel Research Department, examines the effect of the Bank of Israel’s intervention in the foreign exchange market on the exchange rate in that period. The Bank of Israel has been trying to curb the rise of the shekel, which is trading near its highest level since 2014 and hurting exporters whose sales in foreign markets account for about a third of gross domestic product. Its rally is also due to incoming currency as foreign firms acquire local companies, such as the recent acquisition of Mobileye by Intel Corp., and to the impact of natural gas production, which lowers the need for imported energy resources. After about a decade of not intervening in the foreign exchange market, the Bank of Israel resumed the practice in March 2008. In the beginning, the intervention came at predetermined amounts — purchases of $25 million per day, and then $100 million per day. In August 2009, the Bank changed its policy and switched to intervening at its discretion, at amounts that were not set in advance, the report said. The results of the research, which examines whether the interventions in the market contributed to a depreciation in the exchange rate, or a slowdown in the rate of appreciation, indicate that from September 2009 through the end of 2015, every $100 million purchased by the central bank contributed, all else being equal, to deprecation of 0.07–0.09 percent in the exchange rate. The average monthly scope of purchases during that period — 830 million — was found to have an impact of 0.6 percent on the exchange rate during that month. The research also shows that both the interventions themselves as well as the overall monetary policy, which created intervention expectations, had an effect on the currency. “The intervention’s impact derives as well from the signaling — by the intervention itself — regarding the Bank’s overall monetary policy, and not just from the direct effect of the intervention on the asset market,” the research showed. The research found that the central bank intervenes in the market “when it assesses that the real exchange rate is deviating (overvalued) relative to the long-term equilibrium exchange rate,” the report said. The level of foreign exchange reserves relative to GDP was also found to have an impact on the intervention — the lower the level, the greater the intervention. It was found as well that growth of exports tends to reduce the intervention. Also, the research found that to the extent that 1-year inflation expectations are lower, the Bank will tend to intervene more. That is, intervention in the foreign exchange market also serves as a tool to support the attaining of the inflation target, the report said. The central bank has come under pressure recently by critics who say that its intervention policy has not managed to keep the shekel’s rise in check. In January, in an interview with Bloomberg News, Barry Topf, a former director of market operations at the Bank of Israel who helped design the central bank’s foreign currency intervention program, said the dollar purchases that initially helped Israel weather the global financial crisis may now be hurting the economy by distorting prices. Topf suggested the Bank of Israel should scale back the program significantly, after the country tripled its foreign exchange reserves in less than a decade. The central bank cut the benchmark interest rate to a record low 0.1 percent in 2015 in an effort to boost inflation and rein in the currency, and held it at that level also last month. In February, Flug hinted the Bank of Israel would continue intervening in the market, when necessary, by buying dollars to keep the shekel in check.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 19, 2017 at 7:38AM Looking for a little income and growth for your portfolio? Consider buying shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA might seem like an odd choice for an investor seeking income, but what gets overlooked with this hot tech stock is the willingness of management to reward shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. NVIDIA Gaming has been good to the graphics specialist. In 2016, NVIDIA raked in $4.06 billion in revenue, an increase of 44% over 2015 as the upgrade cycle to the latest high-end graphics processors got under way. Continued advances in gaming technology, higher-resolution displays, and the emergence of eSports provide nice tailwinds for demand over time. Volvo XC90 SUV powered by NVIDIA DRIVE technology. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  In addition, NVIDIA has other promising growth opportunities emerging with the growing adoption of its high-end GPU technology by other industries for deep learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicle applications. The combined revenue from its Datacenter and Automotive segment could be the company's biggest business in the not-too-distant future. In 2016, NVIDIA generated $830 million in revenue from its Datacenter segment, an increase of 145% over 2015, while the Automotive segment grew 52% to $487 million in revenue. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expects the next phase of growth in datacenter to come from several industries, including healthcare, retail, transportation, and life sciences, among others. Here's what he said on a recent earnings conference call: The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as healthcare, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. NVIDIA's technology is essentially affecting every area of the economy, so how do you value a company like that? The best way to evaluate the investment merits of a high-PE, high-growth business is to consider the market opportunity relative to the company's market capitalization. Intel believes the self-driving car market will be worth $70 billion by 2030 and could reach $100 billion. Compare that amount to the less than $500 million NVIDIA generated last year within its Automotive segment, and it's easy to understand the huge opportunity here -- and why NVIDIA's stock has rocketed to the stratosphere. NVDA data by YCharts. While NVIDIA's multibillion-dollar growth opportunities get all of the headlines, the vision and business skills of its management team, led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, get overlooked. Jen-Hsun Huang is the founder of the company and the reason the company is where it is today. He's also been a very shareholder-friendly leader willing to reward shareholders with the company's excess cash flow, something you don't see very often with relatively small companies in technology. The company has consistently paid out a growing dividend since it was initiated in 2012. Over the last three fiscal years, NVIDIA has distributed 83% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It's a good signal from management that they expect the company to continue growing in the future. NVIDIA currently offers a dividend yield of 0.5%; however, the quarterly dividend has nearly doubled over the last four years. As the business continues to grow and generate more cash from operations, the dividend could double again in the next five years, which would put the dividend yield then at 1% on today's share price. Apple Apple has built a sticky ecosystem with its lineup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.  The Apple logo is as recognizable as The Coca-Cola Co logo, Nike's swoosh, or the golden arches. Once you own at least two Apple devices, it's very likely you are hooked for life. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated $218 billion in total revenue and $45 billion in profits. The key driver of Apple's growth is iPhone sales, which made up 69% of total revenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The most important thing for investors to know about is Apple's huge financial advantage over its competitors. Apple earned every penny of the smartphone industry's profits in 2016 while commanding less than 20% market share of unit sales. Absorbing all of the profits among smartphone makers gives Apple an enormous competitive advantage to reinvest in more advanced features, digital content, and other services, making the Apple ecosystem even stronger over time.  As Apple sells more devices, it should boost services revenue from iTunes, Apps, Apple Music subscriptions, and other digital content over time. Services revenue has been Apple's fastest-growing segment recently. In the holiday quarter, Services grew 18% year over year to $7.1 billion, bringing the trailing-12-month amount to over $25 billion. Apple generates robust cash flows, and the cash has been piling up on the balance sheet in recent years. At the end of December 2016, Apple had about $46 per share in cash and marketable securities. This is 33% of the current stock price. The cash-rich balance sheet gives management a lot of flexibility not only in running the business, but in how it chooses to reward shareholders. Apple has paid a steadily increasing dividend for about five years, as well as regular share repurchases to reduce the share count and boost earnings-per-share growth. The share buybacks have also been very timely thanks to the conservative valuation on the stock in recent years. Analysts expect earnings to grow about 9% annually over the next five years, and investors are not paying much for future growth, with the stock currently sitting at 17 times earnings. The stock's dividend yield is currently 1.6%. Even after the stock's recent 30% to 40% increase, it still looks attractive. Investors may not hit a home run with Apple given its nearly $1 trillion market value, but the business has a brand customers love, and it generates a lot of cash, and this should leave shareholders with a decent return over time.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview on Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Hours after Swatch’s announcement, Richemont said it plans its first smartwatch, the Montblanc Summit, which will sell for $890 and up starting in May, using Android 2.0 technology. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. “I’m not convinced,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. “People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object.” Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Swatch also forecast a rebound in US and European markets as it published its annual report on Thursday. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” $15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It’s not unlikely, then, for an entrepreneur to crave more. In this aspect, the world is their oyster. But how do you choose a city with the right conditions that will provide ample opportunities for success? Fear not! We’ve scoured the ends of the Earth for the perfect spots to call home for your business. This isn’t your traditional one to 10 scale of definitive criteria, but mixes the expected with the soul of a go-getter. Whether you’re a nomadic at heart or crave a tight-knit community, here are 13 amazing locales every entrepreneur should consider expanding to. Amsterdam, the Netherlands Amsterdam boasts a thriving business ecosystem – with a stable business climate and diverse talent pool. Amsterdam enjoys a strong competitive position as a location for foreign companies and startups. The city is connected to the rest of Europe and the world – not only by an extensive transport network and the world’s largest internet hub, but also by the city’s collaborative approach to doing business including initiatives such as StartupAmsterdam, StartupDelta, as well as Business in Amsterdam – a comprehensive resource for doing business in area. The city is also home to one of Europe’s leading tech festivals. Additionally, there are various incentives for international employees and entrepreneurs. Highly skilled migrants enjoy a major fiscal benefit in the 30 percent tax ruling. The strategic location, an appeal to international talent, and excellent physical and digital accessibility makes Amsterdam an attractive place for European expansion.  Austin, Texas While you’d expect to see cities such as San Francisco and New York represented on this list, status should be more than a mere zip code. Texas payrolls and labor participation rate have been increasing at a healthy rate in Texas, unlike the national level where these numbers have shrunk to their lowest rate since the 1970s.  Texas business tax – called franchise tax – is very cut and dry. The state taxes most businesses at a rate of one percent on their taxable margins. This tax rate ranks very low nationally, making the state a popular place for businesses of all sizes. As a progressive and fiercely entrepreneurial city – boasting a talent pool that’s highly educated and growing – Austin, Texas is a great place for businesses to call home. Ranking second in the country, Austin’s gross metropolitan product grew 18.2 percent from 2011 to 2014. Many global conglomerates have operations in the Central Texas area including Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Facebook, Cisco Systems, Intel, and Oracle.  Tech companies in Austin actually account for a large amount of all tech-related revenue in Texas – second only to the DFW area. In fact, the Texas capital was recently named number one place in America to start a business. Bali, Indonesia For the nomadic businessman or woman, Bali offers a never-ending stream of inspiration. One of the attractions for startups and other companies working in Bali is, obviously, the cost of living is cheaper than elsewhere on this list. The average cost living – including food, living, office, social and entertainment costs ­­– is under $1,100 per month. Bali attracts an abundance of local and international talent thanks to its digital nomad culture. As such, the tropical paradise has developed an abundance of co-working spaces. Things have been set in motion, allowing entrepreneurship to flourish in Bali. Part of a growing ecosystem, the great thing about starting a business in Bali is that you don’t need a significant amount of capital. With the cost of living fairly cheap, you can keep operational costs low. That said, Indonesia has quite a bit of regulation, meaning several different types of permits are needed for local businesses. And Bali’s resident tax payers are subject to taxes based on international income, though Indonesia does have a double taxation treaty with over 57 other countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, and the US. Berlin, Germany Though the largest population, market, and economy in the EU, businesses shouldn’t shy away from the many offerings Germany presents. In fact, entrepreneurs are increasingly drawn to Berlin’s creative and open-minded ethos. The German government is very open to the establishment of all types of businesses – regardless of whether or not it involves a German or a foreigner. As such, companies can easily employ international workers, as local visas aren’t difficult to acquire. Berlin boasts the highest concentration of researchers and academics in Germany (per capita). Coupled with the city’s declining unemployment rates means an available and able workforce for new companies. Additionally, businesses based in Berlin rub shoulders with innovation centers of more-established tech competitors such as Microsoft, German software giant SAP SE, and networking pioneer Cisco System. Overall, Berlin is a fully developed hub for creativity and entrepreneurship with the talent to boot. Dublin, Ireland Ireland prides itself for having a competitive corporate tax rate – 12.5 percent to be exact – particularly when compared to many other EU capitals. Additionally, because the country taxes on a strictly territorial basis, companies that expand here pay only the local rate on whatever profits are generated in foreign subsidiaries. This alone is extremely attractive to foreign investment. Ireland has the youngest population in the European Union, with an average age of 34 years. For those thinking of long-term investment, this is a great asset for employers. Dublin is alive with tech companies. It’s docklands, dubbed Silicon Docks, plays host to the large tech giants such as Google and Facebook but also to a number indigenous startups. The area has become one of the most prosperous of the country, and makes Dublin a good choice for global expansion. A young and educated workforce means the business culture in that country is actively seeking new technology. Additionally, labor and real estate is less expensive in Dublin than most other European cities its size… though labor costs throughout Ireland are expected to rise. Hong Kong One of the world’s leading financial centers, the ‘Pearl of the Orient’ enjoys a supportive government along with a plethora of startup organizations, VCs, and angels. Setting up a company in Hong Kong is fast, easy and inexpensive. The pseudo-independent country operates a low and simple tax system where corporate tax is maximum 16.5 percent, and personal income tax 15 percent. Sales tax, no Withholding tax, and no tax on capital gains, dividends or an individual’s estate. In addition to a favorable corporate tax rate, Hong Kong-based companies promote easy access to Shenzhen and Guangzhou – two of Mainland China’s most prosperous and sophisticated manufacturing hubs. Hong Kong’s proximity to and unique relationship with Mainland China has made it the business gateway to China for more than 150 years. London, Great Britain Benefiting from flexible employment laws and low-cost legal structures, entrepreneurs’ visas and capital gains tax relief, London remains highly attractive. London continues to be a magnet thanks to its unique blend of market size, maturity and high degree of transparency. London offers one of Europe’s best and most diverse workforce. Among more than four million workers you’ll find 230 languages, tech specialists, and 400,000 creatives. While some feared a post-Brexit decline in the economy – and the full impact of Brexit will take years to be realized – Britain’s economy performed far better than expected, with GDP growth falling to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent the previous quarter. Paris, France France is the eighth largest economy in the world, and with its steely economy and business ethic, the country is a global force. Additionally, France hosts some of the continent’s leading businesses and is the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment. Working almost 18 percent less hours than the global average, Paris enjoys the top spot when it comes to a work-life balance. But it’s not all berets and baguettes for the city of love. The French capital also has one of the highest concentrations of the world’s biggest companies and is home to the headquarters of oil company Total, investment bank BNP Paribas, and global communications agency Havas. With one of the highest GDPs than other cities, Paris is one of the most important business, financial, and political centers of the world. Santiago, Chile While there are a various choices when entering the LATAM market, Chile has been “one of the fastest-growing economies of Latin America” over the last decade. And seven years ago, the country set out to transform itself into the innovation and entrepreneurial hub of Latin America. Since 2010, the Chilean government has continued to pour money into promising startups through its Startup Chile program. By all accounts, this experiment has paid off, as more than 1,000 startups have graduated from the program, with many remaining in Santiago and others going on to raise additional capital for growth. Santiago is big by any measure, but what makes it truly imposing is its size in relation to the rest of Chile, the sheer extent to which is concentrated the country’s power and wealth. Here, new businesses are immersed in a vibrant startup culture, enjoying low costs and relatively light tax burden, and visionaries come to stay. Seattle, Washington Washington, unlike many other states, does not have an income tax. The state’s business and occupation (B&O) tax is calculated on the gross income from activities, meaning there are no deductions from the B&O tax for labor, materials, taxes, or other costs of doing business. The business atmosphere in Washington state is best described as young and healthy, with the state’s economy growing faster than the nation’s overall economy.  In fact, Washington has hit a sweet spot of both strong employment and wage growth, and Seattle is driving the state’s economy forward. The Emerald City is more than the Wizard of Oz could have imagined. Seattle area has emerged as the epicenter of the cloud technology industry and the city is on fire with Silicon Valley tech giants —Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Adobe, Twitter — expanding in the region. Seattle has a community of angel investors who are not only investing in the future of technology but able to provide great insight to budding entrepreneurs. You’ll find a legacy of experience building great companies — both consumer and enterprise. Stockholm, Sweden With lower bureaucracy and quicker processing times than its European neighbors, Sweden is known as the easiest and most efficient country in Europe to start new enterprises in. Additionally, the Scandinavian nation’s $493 billion economy grew 4.2 percent last year. Stockholm is an attractive hub for business with the advantage of an open, competitive, and resilient environment which has long defined Sweden. In fact, no other European city has produced more billion-dollar unicorn startups per capita. Taxes are still high relative to the rest of the developed world, but taxes paid as a percent of profit are down eight percentage points over the past decade. With an active business community complemented by world-class academic institutions, Stockholm is diverse, innovative, and globally connected. Tel Aviv, Israel The people of Israel have built a successful economy, and Tel Aviv is a buzzing and modern city. Though quite a small country, the Israeli economy is successful and has seen growth in excess of five percent over the last few years. More than 6,000 startups call the city home, and accelerators like the 8200 EISP and The Junction are also there to welcome budding businesses. Nicknamed ‘Silicon Wadi’, Israel is known for its relationship with high tech industries. With an open and liberal FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) regime, incentives such as tax breaks, setting up a business in Israel can be a highly profitable profitable move. Toronto, Canada As the business and financial capital of Canada, it’s no wonder why major corporations want to be located in Toronto. The Toronto economy is dominated by free market activities and private enterprise. As a result, it’s relatively easy to commence or expand business activities. With the lowest total taxes, including the most generous R&D tax treatment, and the second lowest business costs among G8 countries, professionals enjoy a much better cost of living and plenty of talented workers available for hire. Wellington, New Zealand New Zealand ranks as the easiest place in the world to start a business, taking less than a day. The country’s GDP rose 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, one of the top growth rates in the developed world. The local market is highly deregulated and guarantees stability, free trade, and active government support for investments to companies expanding in New Zealand. Wellington boasts a highly-educated, creative and innovative workforce, continued economic growth as well as lower operating costs and a great mix of small business support. And at 47 percent, the capital city is well above the national average (33 percent) for workforce in knowledge intensive industry. Pack your bags Launching in a new market isn’t easy, but with the same tenacity you used to setup your first shop, it’s certainly possible. Now that you’ve found the right city, now it’s time to make the next move. TMF Group is running series of webinars on European cities. Register to hear about Paris and Dublin from local experts.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News NSFOCUS launches in Australia, ideally placed to halt cyber attack tsunami from China SYDNEY, March 17, 2017 – NSFOCUS, a global provider of intelligent hybrid DDoS defences, today announced its launch into Australia. The company believes it is uniquely placed to defend against cyber-attacks from China.   Recent reports have indicated that up to 40 percent of global cyber-attacks are associated with China and the exploits discovered in this region can take days, weeks, or even months before they are replicated elsewhere.   “NSFOCUS Global Threat Intelligence is ideally placed to help Australian organisations improve their awareness and enterprise security posture – delivering both strategic and tactical intelligence, and providing organisations with a complete view of the global threat landscape, including China,” said Attley Ng, Senior Vice President Asia Pacific, NSFOCUS.   NSFOCUS is the only company that can provide insight from inside China as well elsewhere around the world, making it uniquely qualified to help mitigate these risks before they escalate. With more than 4,000 active customers, 12,000 network sensors, extensive honeypot networks, over 700G of data collected daily, and visibility into 400 million endpoints, NSFOCUS’ suite of Threat Intelligence solutions help organisations to get ahead of future attacks by implementing countermeasures quickly to protect critical assets.   “The launch of NSFOCUS into Australia is a natural extension of our progress across Asia Pacific,” said Mr. Ng. “Australia has a mature information technology market, with a rich depth of IT expertise that includes cyber security professionals, yet corporates and governments are still falling prey to cyber-attacks.”   He added: “In the aftermath of the massive cyber-attacks the world witnessed last year, organisations in Australia and worldwide can no longer rely solely on threat intelligence feeds to alert them to risks.   “Despite rapid innovation to combat growing threats, security professionals with limited intelligence resources still struggle to keep up with the overwhelming amount of data points these systems aggregate. Implementing a holistic, intelligence-driven solution with true global insight can help security teams to understand strategic and tactical intelligence – not just feed data – to take immediate action on the threats to their business. Our worldwide team of researchers and engineers work around the clock to help customers gain visibility and threat context to effectively respond to threats, both known and unknown.”   The NSFOCUS Threat Intel feed integrates seamlessly with the company’s Cloud and On-Premises DDoS defences, giving organisations such as government, big enterprises and service providers in Australia an additional layer of secured protections.   NSFOCUS has appointed Aquion as its Authorised Value Distributor, to provide localised support to the Australian market and help in recruitment and enabling security channel partners. Already NSFOCUS has committed to sponsoring two major security events this year: the AISA security conference and AusCert 2017.   Stephen Balicki, Managing Director, Aquion said: “Our partnership with NSFOCUS presents us with exceptional opportunities, as their comprehensive solutions deliver a real edge in the data security arena. These will appeal to channel partners and reinforce our AqSEC business unit which helps customers to monitor, manage and secure all elements of enterprise infrastructure using the best technologies.”   “As an endorsement of our capabilities, NSFOCUS is the leading choice when it comes to data security options,” said James Braunegg, Managing Director of Melbourne-based Micron21. “Our Tier IV data centre is the first in Australia to achieve Uptime Institute Tier IV Fault Tolerant Design Certification. This establishes Micron 21 as the most secure, reliable and high calibre commercial information technology facility in Australia.   “In addition to our Tier IV compliance, Micron 21 is ISO 27001 certified. To achieve these stellar standards, we researched the best data security options, and selected NSFOCUS. Now we are confident that reliability, security and premium technology set the standard for our services.”   The NSFOCUS suite of Threat Intelligence solutions includes:   NSFOCUS Threat Intelligence (NTI) Portal: Allows users to gain additional insight into various threats and threat actors via research, data collection, and analysis of crowdsourced information. NSFOCUS customers can drill deeper into detail on threats, upload malware samples for analysis, and monitor/track IP addresses with automatic notifications – providing a tailored experience for the most relevant threats. Threat Analysis Alerts and Reports: NSFOCUS provides timely analysis on threat trends, campaigns and actors, in addition to critical vulnerabilities identified. Via weekly blogs, emergency alerts and regularly released reports, customers are updated on the latest threat information available. Actionable Data Feeds: Delivered by strategically located NSFOCUS Cloud Centers, these feeds provide information across four crucial risk areas: IP Reputation: A list of IP addresses that have earned a negative reputation through involvement in suspicious activity, including phishing, botnets, APTs, DDoS attacks and more. Malicious Web/URL: A domain reputation list that includes malicious websites that are the source of exploit kits, malware and phishing attacks. Command & Control:  A set of IP addresses that are known to control botnet armies used to take services offline. This feed is used to prevent organizations’ own resources from unknowingly participating in cyber-attacks, mitigate ransomware, as well as conserving network resources. Malware Hashes: A set of MD5 file hashes that can be used to identify malware in email or file transfers, as well as stored data – protecting against malware, ransomware, Trojans, scanning, probing, and data leakage. NSFOCUS can easily augment existing threat intelligence through integration with other threat intelligence offerings or SIEM deployments, and across NSFOCUS’ network and application security products.   To learn more about NSFOCUS’ approach to threat intelligence, visit http://nsfocusglobal.com/threat-intelligence/   Contact Christine Tee Sr. Director, Channels and Marketing, NSFOCUS (65) 9679 1481 ctee@nsfocusglobal.com   About NSFOCUS IB   NSFOCUS IB is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSFOCUS, an award-winning enterprise application and network security provider, with operations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

Last week, Tag Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel, Montblanc released the $890 Summit, and Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract Millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. The original version of the Apple Watch starts at $269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honored watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” Tag Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version, which is Swiss-made, Tag Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were sold last year, missing the forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 percent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 percent, IDC said. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets. Guy estimates that Tag Heuer got slightly less than than 10 percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity (with) too many smartwatches,” Guy said.

This is despite the strong bull move in the overall market. Source: Shutterstock So might the current value of NVDA stock be at an attractive level now? Or maybe it’s a better idea to hold off? Well, the fact is that Nvidia remains one of the best operators in the semiconductor industry, with a dominant position in graphics processing units (GPUs). While this technology is still primarily for gaming — which continues to be a solid market opportunity — the applications span emerging categories, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars, internet of things and cloud computing. The main reason is that GPUs can process enormous amounts of data on a cost-effective basis. And yes, NVDA has had little trouble monetizing its valuable assets. Just look at the most recent quarter, in which revenues spiked by 55% to $2.17 billion and the adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion and earnings of 83 cents on NVDA stock. It was certainly a blow-out. But interestingly enough, it didn’t really matter — that is, at least for NVDA stock. Then again, much of the story is baked into the valuation. Consider that the price-earnings ratio is at about 40. By comparison, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) sports a multiple of 23 and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 16.5. Granted, NVDA stock deserves a premium valuation because of its torrid growth ramp. But according to several notable Wall Street analysts, the current multiple appears to still be at frothy levels. During the past couple weeks, Instinet analyst Romit Shah put a price target of $90 on NVDA stock and analysts from BMO Capital Markets went even lower, with a $85 price target. Actually, the Wall Street consensus is for $113.59 a share, which implies only 9% upside. But it is important to note that there are some notable risk factors, which could easily weigh on Nvidia stock as well.

After just seven months at Uber, its president, Jeff Jones, is quitting, explaining that the “beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber.” Add to the list, in the last month or so: vice president of maps and business Brian McClendon, vice president of product and growth Ed Baker, security researcher Charlie Miller, and senior engineer Amit Singhal.

Shortly after he was born, Cameron Harding was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy—an inherited illness that destroys motor neurons, quickly limits movement, and usually kills children before they turn two. But after he was treated with a new kind of RNA drug, he was soon able to move again, making him one of the first children to make such a recovery. We investigate a new breed of RNA therapies to understand the complexities they face and the promise they could offer. Ad Boycotts Tackle Offensive Online Content Sometimes, money can be power. Offensive content remains a significant problem for Internet giants like Facebook and Google, but a particularly galvanizing solution to the problem may come from big-name companies boycotting advertising. A number of banks and telecom companies in the UK have pulled ads from Google and YouTube over concerns that their promotions are appearing next to extremist material. The news has left executives at the search firm—which makes most of its income from ads—reeling, with a quick fix solution already issued but some tough decisions ahead.

The DRAGEN end-to-end platform is an ultra-rapid, fully automated solution for analysis of next-generation sequencing data both onsite and in the cloud. Powered by FPGA-centric technology that features optimized algorithms for mapping, alignment, sorting, variant calling and more, DRAGEN enables a whole genome to be analyzed in only 20 minutes onsite, or even under 10 minutes in a single cloud instance, while maintaining high accuracy and significantly lowering costs. DRAGEN also features hyper-efficient lossless, real-time compression of data files, reducing genomic data footprint and long-term storage costs significantly. Multiple end-to-end, clinical-grade pipelines are available from Edico, including genome/exome, cancer, transcriptome/RNA-seq, structural variant, copy number variant, epigenome/methyl-seq, metagenome/microbiome, joint genotyping and third-party pipelines such as GATK 3.6. The platform is flexible and allows for customization of algorithms and existing pipelines. This system is managed through the browser-based DRAGEN portal, which features an easy-to-use, "drag and drop" interface, or fully parameterizable command line scripting. Best-in-class solutions for onsite, cloud or hybrid cloud analysis have been created through partnerships with top technology companies, including Intel, IBM, Dell EMC, and Amazon Web Services. To date Edico's customers have processed more than ten petabytes of data using DRAGEN for a range of activities, including processing of whole genomes, exomes or analyzing 3D genome structures.

Adar 25, 5777, 3/23/2017   MainAll NewsForeign Affairs'The future belongs to those countries who can innovate' 'The future belongs to those countries who can innovate' PM Netanyahu speaks in China at meeting of Israeli, Chinese, businessmen, says China-Israel marriage is 'made in Heaven.' Contact Editor Arutz Sheva Staff, 20/03/17 13:47 Binyamin Netanyahu Flash90 On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu spoke at a meeting of Israeli and Chinese businesspeople. Netanyahu landed in China on Sunday for an official visit in honor of the two countries' 25-year relationship. "This is a stark change from the first visit I had in China over 20 years ago, when I came during my first visit as Prime Minister," Netanyahu said. "The streets were lined with bicycles, a lot of bicycles, few cars, some new buildings, but mostly old buildings. And I have to say less smog. "You see the force, the great, enormous swirl of Chinese progress and Chinese ascendency, with all its challenges and all its problems, assume its place on the world stage in a very exciting development in human affairs and something that all nations – all nations – seek to take part of, to be partners with China, to be of assistance to China and thereby also assist themselves. "In this period, in these decades, Israel too has not stood still. Israel has moved and become one of the foremost centers of global innovation, a technological global power. It is true that we also amended our economy. We changed it. We changed it into a much freer economy, a more liberal economy more aligned with free trade principles, free market principles. "The combination of the innate technology that we had and the market economy that we built created a very powerful explosion of startup companies in various fields, drawing on military capabilities, especially in the field of IT, but rapidly expanding into other areas. "As a result, and for other reasons that I won’t enumerate here, Israel has become a hub of innovation. Not just a hub of innovation; perhaps the other hub of innovation – of cross-fertilized innovation. That’s one of the advantages of being small. People meet up and talk to each other... "We have of course the phenomena that produces what I called mushrooms after the rain. So we have a lot of mushrooms because of this climate. It’s very conducive to getting mushrooms – startup companies that begin to grow and they’re picked. They’re picked by American companies. They’re picked by Chinese companies or by German companies. "Last week, Intel, a very large international company, bought a company, an automotive company in Israel – autonomous automotive technology, the wave of the future. It bought it in Jerusalem for 15 billion dollars. "In 2016 in Israel, we received 20% of the global private investment in cyber security. That’s 200 times our relative weight in the world population. There are 500 startups in cyber security in Israel. There are 500 startups in automotive technology in Israel. "A third area that’s developing is digital health. We have data, computerized data for just about every person in Israel, and we can merge that data and have preventative medicine. We can also do this with fewer doctors, because it can be done by telemedicine, and we can also have targeted, personal medicine because the data is so much better. "I don’t know where the next great breakouts of genius will come, but it is clear – it is clear for Israel, it is clear for China, it’s clear for everyone in the world. What is happening now is that every single field of human endeavor is becoming technological. The distinction between hi-tech and low-tech is no longer valid. Everything is becoming hi-tech.... The future now belongs to those countries who can innovate, who can upgrade their products and services for the betterment of their citizens with these new technologies. "So here’s the particular marriage that I see between Israel and China. I think that there is an extraordinary capacity for China to assume its rightful place, as it’s doing, on the world stage. It depends on the consistent ability to elevate living standards with additional added value that can be supplied only by technology, because at a certain point, once you give roads, railroads, intersections, buildings... "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort. And we think there are only two such concentrations of technology in the world for the moment, and we are one of them. We are eager to work with you. We’re going to sign with the government in the coming days a series of agreements on how we can pursue this cooperation, how we can help China in its plans and how China of course can enable us to participate in its great projects. But I believe this is a marriage made in heaven."

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  ×  four  =  8 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter To find the best tech stocks to buy in 2017, we picked from the four tech trends ready to take off this year. Sales growth in these industries is expected to rise as much as three times, 12 times – in one case 30 times – by 2020. And the top stock picks in each sector have share-price targets as much as 40% to 100% higher than where they trade today. You’ve likely been told before these trends are “hot” investments. Thing is, in years past, these particular technologies were not yet mature. Anyone who tried investing in these areas years ago and didn’t see the gains they expected was just too early. But these industries have changed. “My big tech sector prediction for 2017 is that these four ‘disappointers’ will achieve breakout status,” Money Morning Director of Tech & Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson said. Robinson has a knack for identifying trends on the verge of going big and the stocks to buy to profit from them. Time and again he’s delivered outsized gains to subscribers to his Nova-X research service, such as 396% on cybersecurity firm NQ Mobile Inc. (NYSE ADR: NQ), 352% on chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), and 818% on biotech firm Pharmacyclics Inc. (now a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc. [NYSE: ABBV]). Here Robinson takes you on the inside of these industries to show why they’re finally ready for breakout growth – and gives you the best stocks to buy now to make the most money from them… Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017: Virtual Reality We’ve been hearing about virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) for almost two decades now. Here’s a quick primer: Virtual reality is completely immersive – you only can see what a headset shows you. In augmented reality, holographic images are superimposed on real world surroundings, often using a tablet or smartphone (example: Pokèmon Go). Robinson said he first encountered VR in 1991 with the Sega VR add-on to the Genesis console. But in the past few years, the technology finally caught up with the vision. Last year, VR/AR tech began to reach “critical mass” with consumers, Robinson said, setting it up for a big year in 2017. Research firm IDC estimated that consumers bought 9 million virtual reality headsets in 2016, a 2,470% increase over VR headset sales the previous year. And this market is just getting warmed up. IDC has forecast the global VR/AR market will explode from sales of $5.2 billion in 2016 to sales of $162 billion in 2020. "AR likely will be a much larger tech sector because its smart glasses, which overlay digital data like blueprints and technical specs, are already ripe for business users," Robinson said. "And we also could see most smartphone functions migrate to AR." CitiGroup's Global Perspectives Group has forecast that the combined AR/VR market will balloon to $2.16 trillion in sales by 2035. But Robinson is most excited about a third variation – mixed reality. Mixed reality combines elements of AR and VR. Don't Miss: The Five Best Infrastructure Stocks to Watch in 2017 Mixed reality is a much more sophisticated augmented reality. In MR, sensors and advanced optics combine realistic holographic images that interact with the surrounding environment (creating a phantom hole in a wall that appears real, for instance). "I believe 2017 will mark the first year in which MR begins to get attention from Wall Street and the financial media," Robinson said. One of the best tech stocks to buy for mixed reality is Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT). The HoloLens is among the most advanced versions of MR right now, and Microsoft is positioning it to succeed both as a gaming platform and a business tool. A tech stock to buy for VR is Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB), which owns the Oculus Rift. The combination of Facebook's massive social media reach and a virtual reality platform opens up a lot of profitable possibilities. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called it "a new communication platform" and believes it will allow people to share experiences the way they share photos now. Another tech stock to buy to profit from the VR/AR/MR trend is Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). "This Silicon Valley chip leader is investing heavily in the field and could reap billions from VR and AR in the next few years," Robinson said. Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence is a tech trend that has had its share of hype over the years, but wasn't quite ready for prime time. But according to Robinson, 2017 is when AI will shine. "Thanks to breakthroughs made over the past decade, AI is now capable of 'cognitive computing,'" Robinson said. "That means the machines take key data relationships into account so the system can move swiftly onto the next set of data to crunch." The more capable hardware means AI finally can fulfill its long-promised potential. We're already seeing progress in AI-driven Big Data analysis, online chatbots that help customers resolve common issues, and devices talking to each other — the Internet of Everything. This is another market on the brink of explosive growth. Research firm MarketsandMarkets has forecast that artificial intelligence sales will grow 12-fold from $420 million in 2014 to $5.05 billion in 2020. Among the best tech stocks to buy for AI is Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB), which already has deployed AI via chatbots on its Messenger platform and has big plans to use AI more widely. Robinson said that Facebook has made more progress in AI technology than the other tech titans like Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq; GOOGL, GOOG), particularly in areas like face recognition. Trending: Bitcoin Price Predictions and 2017 Forecasts from 11 Top Influencers "With AI making Facebook an even more ruthlessly effective social network, the firm will remain in the lead for years to come," Robinson said. He believes Facebook stock will climb over the next several years, reaching $250 a share by 2020 – nearly double the current price of $129. Robinson is even more enthused about the tech stocks to buy for his last two 2017 tech trends… Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017: Cybersecurity Join the conversation.

Connected-vehicle technology seen as boon to safety, efficiency. Related Media Study Says Autonomous, Connected Cars to Enrich U.K. Oz Group Lists Consumer Connected-Car Concerns Eight U.K. Cities Share Millions for EV Incentives The U.K. government holds a roundtable conference with auto-industry leaders to discuss plans to make the region a world leader in electric, connected and autonomous vehicles. Chaired by Transport Minister John Hayes, it was attended by representatives of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, vehicle manufacturers, the Center for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and Office for Low Emission Vehicles. Hayes outlined the content of the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill now pending in a House of Commons committee. The legislation is designed to help position the U.K. as a global destination for the development of ultra-low-emissions and connected and autonomous vehicles. It introduces policies to modernize the region’s transport system and help capitalize on what the government sees as a £51 billion ($62.6 billion) -a-year economic opportunity. Measures include electric-charging infrastructure at service stations and fuel retailers, ensuring charging points are compatible with all vehicles across all networks, and updating insurance rules addressing autonomous driving. The roundtable came ahead of an SMMT cross-industry event on connected and autonomous vehicles taking place March 30 in London. SMMT Connected 2017 will bring together senior automotive executives, technology-sector representatives and policymakers to discuss the latest developments and challenges around connected- and autonomous-vehicle technology in the U.K. It will feature panel discussions on the social benefits of driverless vehicles, current and potential safety benefits, and challenges of cybersecurity and data protection. It also will share learning from international initiatives already under way. Scheduled to speak are Ian Robertson, Member of the Board of Management, BMW; David Richter, vice president-strategic initiatives, Uber; Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager-Automated Driving Group, Intel; and Mike Hawes, CEO, SMMT. A report to be released at the SMMT meeting will explore the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on various sectors of society. It will focus on how the new technology will affect social groups and explore its potential social and financial benefits. Hawes says the U.K. is the European Union’s biggest market for electric cars, while on-road trials of next-generation self-driving vehicles already are taking place on U.K. roads. “These vehicles will transform our roads and society, dramatically reducing accidents, improving air quality, connecting people and saving thousands of lives every year,” Hawes says in a statement. “Our SMMT Connected event later this month will explore in detail how the UK automotive sector – and society as a whole – is poised to benefit.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Walt Disney – Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" set a March opening weekend record with $170 million in North American ticket sales. Transocean – The oilfield services company struck a deal to sell 15 drilling rigs to Norway's Borr Drilling for $1.35 billion. The deal includes 10 rigs already in Transocean's fleet and five that are under construction. IBM – IBM introduced a new service that lets companies build applications in IBM's cloud using blockchain code. MoneyGram – MoneyGram offered to share confidential information with suitor and rival electronic payments company Euronet Worldwide , according to Reuters. Euronet had made a $1 billion acquisition offer last week, despite MoneyGram already having a deal in place to be bought by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. Sprouts Farmers Market — Sprouts is in preliminary talks to move with grocery chain Albertsons, according to a Bloomberg report. The early stage proposal involved taking the organic grocer private and adding it to Albertsons brands such as Safeway, Vons, and Shaw's. Reports of the talks are also lifting shares of Whole Foods. Shake Shack – The restaurant chain's stock was upgraded to "neutral" from "underperform" at Wedbush, which gave valuation and lowered expectations as the primary reasons for its move. Tiffany – The luxury goods retailer was upgraded to "outperform" from "neutral" at William Blair. The report said Tiffany's business has become more stable and that the stock may benefit from easier comparisons. Unilever – The consumer products giant is set to sell some of its food brands for nearly $7.5 billion, according to British newspaper reports. That follows its rejection of a $143 billion takeover offer from Kraft Heinz last month. Alaska Air – The stock was upgraded to "buy" from "hold" at Stifel Nicolaus, with Stifel pointing to so-far unrecognized value in the airline's loyalty program. Nektar Therapeutics – The drugmaker announced positive results from a study of its new opioid pain medication, which is designed to treat pain effectively without causing abuse and addiction as has been the case with standard opioids. Abbott Labs — Study results for Abbott's dissolving vascular stent showed significantly higher adverse events in patients than those treated with Abbott's older Xience stent. However, researchers did say that new guidelines involving the newer stent's use should improve results. Intel – The chipmaker has debuted products based on its newest memory technology, which closes the gap between conventional and flash memory. Mobileye – Mobileye is not locked into its takeover deal with Intel announced last week, according to a New York Post report. The paper said the maker of autonomous driving technology may be looking for a higher offer. PPG Industries – PPG may have a renewed chance of buying Dutch rival and paint maker Akzo Nobel. The Wall Street Journal reports that activist investor Elliott Management owns a stake in Akzo, and is pushing it to engage in talks with PPG. Sonic– Sonic was downgraded to "hold" from "buy" at Canaccord Genuity, which cites increased discounting and its belief that sales at the restaurant chain have been soft in recent months. Apple – Apple is still rated "outperform" at Cowen, but the firm raised its price target to $155 per share from $135, saying current consensus estimates for Apple remain far too low.
