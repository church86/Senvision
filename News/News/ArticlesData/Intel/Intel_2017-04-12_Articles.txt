Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV (MBLY.N), and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems.

Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co <GM.N> are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s <GOOGL.O> Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc <DLPH.N> are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the centre for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s <VOWG_p.DE> Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc <TSLA.O>, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL] and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc <BIDU.O> and Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> (For a graphic on self-driving vehicles see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc) The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house – as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together,” said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. “These different approaches will have to pass the test of time,” he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” (Reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

The race to develop and exploit autonomous vehicle technology is reshaping the hierarchy of the automotive industry, replacing traditional top-down manufacturing relationships with complex webs of alliances and acquisitions. Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's Mercedes.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Apr 12, 2017 at 7:03PM After launching the high-end Ryzen 7 line of PC CPUs in March to somewhat mixed reviews, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is now taking a crack at the mainstream portion of the market. Ryzen 5, comprised of four CPUs featuring either four or six cores, is aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 family of chips. Priced between $169 and $249, Ryzen 5 offers more cores and threads than Intel's comparable chips. But the same trade-off that made Ryzen 7 a mixed bag persists: Single-threaded performance is a weakness for Ryzen, and AMD's pricing may not be aggressive enough to overcome that issue. A look at Ryzen 5 The highest-end Ryzen 5 chip, the 1600X, is priced at $249, offering six cores and 12 threads. The 1600X is essentially the Ryzen 1800X with two cores and $150 lopped off, making it a good budget option for those who use applications that can take advantage of that many threads. Like the 1800X, though, the 1600X falls short when single-threaded performance is important. Image source: AMD. The 1600 also has six cores and 12 threads, but it comes with a lower clock speed and a $219 price tag. The 1500X and 1400 both come with four cores and eight threads priced at $189 and $169, respectively, with the 1400 having a lower clock speed and half as much L3 cache as the rest of the Ryzen 5 lineup. The competition is Intel's Core i5 line of chips. All of Intel i5 chips come with at most four cores, and those quad-core chips don't support hyperthreading, meaning that the number of threads is equal to the number of cores. All the Ryzen 5 chips have a major advantage when it comes to multithreaded performance due to this discrepancy -- the same story that played out with Ryzen 7. Good at some things, not so good at others Like Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to single-threaded performance. In its review of Ryzen 5, Anandtech puts that disadvantage at about 10% to 15%. The upside is that the two higher-end Ryzen 5 chips have 50% more cores and triple the threads compared to Intel's i5 chips. In situations where single-threaded performance matters greatly, like opening PDF documents and in games that don't make great use of more than a few cores, Ryzen 5 gets trounced by Intel's Core i5 chips. The i5-7600 is 16.7% faster at opening a PDF document than the 1600X, according to Anandtech's review, a difference that will be noticeable to users. Ryzen 5 falls well behind in some games. Anandtech's test of Rise of the Tomb Raider has the 1600X with a 28% lower frame rate at a 1080p resolution. That gap disappears at a 4K resolution, but that's only because the GPU becomes the bottleneck. Ryzen 5 fares far better in other games, though, thanks to its core count advantage. Anandtech's Civilization 6 benchmark has the 1600X well ahead of the i5-7600 at both 1080p and 4K resolutions. When it comes to gaming, Ryzen 5 seems to be more competitive than Ryzen 7, which was beat by cheaper Intel chips in most gaming benchmarks. Ryzen 5 shines in applications that can make full use of its cores. Applications like compressing files, encoding video, and 3D rendering all benefit greatly from a higher core count. Anandtech's 7-Zip compression benchmark, for example, has the 1600X scoring nearly 90% higher than the i5-7600. Ryzen 5 is the runaway winner for these types of applications. Pricing might be a problem The 1600X priced at $249 is a no-brainer for users that benefit from more cores. But as a mainstream gaming CPU, the 1600X is more of a mixed bag. Intel's i5-7600 is priced around $213, and the unlocked i5-7600K sells for around $242. The cheaper Intel chips outperform the 1600X in quite a few games, although they get beat in some CPU-intensive titles. AMD's pricing isn't very disruptive, especially considering that Ryzen 5 is at a disadvantage when it comes to everyday tasks that benefit from better single-threaded performance. The 1600X is certainly a viable alternative to Intel's chips, but it comes with a lot of trade-offs and a higher price. If AMD's goal is to win back considerable market share from Intel, it will likely need to do better than this. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Clear Linux Switches From ACPI CPUFreq To P-State Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 12 April 2017 at 07:56 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's Clear Linux distribution has switched from using the ACPI CPUFreq scaling driver for recent generations of Intel hardware to now using the P-State CPU frequency scaling driver. Intel's P-State driver has been around since the Sandy Bridge days, but the results have been mixed with sometimes P-State working out well for conserving power use but not necessarily delivering expected performance. Linux gamers, server administrators, and others have generally long avoided P-State. While many Linux distributions have been defaulting to P-State for years, Clear Linux has been one of the few still preferring to use CPUFreq for delivering the best out-of-the-box experience (and performance). As a sign though of P-State's maturing in recent kernel releases, they are now defaulting to P-State. Those running Clear Linux on newer Intel hardware will find P-State is used in place of CPUFreq while "performance" is the default governor choice. Great to see this happen and a further indication of P-State finally getting into shape. My tests of P-State on recent Linux kernel releases have been in good shape while there is more P-State tweaking and improvements slated for Linux 4.12. Stay tuned for benchmarks. Clear Linux as of today is on Linux 4.10.9, GCC 6.3.0, LLVM Clang 3.9.1, Mesa 17.1-dev, X.Org Server 1.19, and Beignet 1.4. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News What Apple vs Qualcomm could mean for the iPhone’s future What Apple vs Qualcomm could mean for the iPhone’s future By Lewis Leong Mobile phones   Dueling lawsuits and a question of performance Shares Apple dropped a bombshell in January by suing Qualcomm, one of its biggest hardware partners, for $1 billion. Qualcomm is the chipmaker responsible for the vast majority of mobile processors, such as the Snapdragon silicon found in most Android phones, as well as chips that connect to cellular networks, used in Apple’s iPhones.  Fast forward to this week, and Qualcomm fired back at Apple with a 134-page countersuit of its own, allegedly the tech giant crippled the performance of its cellular chips in order to protect Apple’s other cellular chip supplier, Intel.  If you’re confused by all the back and forth, let’s break down why Apple and Qualcomm are suing each other in the first place and what this could mean for the future of the iPhone. Why is Apple suing one of its biggest chip suppliers? Apple’s lawsuit [ PDF] against Qualcomm stems from the latter’s patent fees. Apple claims Qualcomm is overcharging it by inflating patent prices. In a statement provided to CNBC, Apple claims Qualcomm charges “at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.”  Apple goes on to say, “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as Touch ID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.”  Qualcomm charges Apple licensing fees which are calculated as a percentage of the total cost of iPhones, according to Fortune, which amounts to about $15 per phone. Apple claims this is monopolistic as well as unfair to other chipmakers as Qualcomm’s licensing costs piggyback off the cost of the iPhone as a whole.  Furthermore, Qualcomm levies a licensing fee on Apple regardless if its chips are used in a phone. This means Apple pays Qualcomm once to license its patents and pays again to purchase Qualcomm’s silicon. For comparison, most component suppliers bundle their intellectual property license fee with the sale of their chips.  Apple isn’t the only one upset with Qualcomm. The San Diego-based company has come under fire in recent years for monopolistic practices. Just two years ago, Qualcomm paid $975 million to China for anti-competitive practices. In December 2016, Qualcomm was hit with a $873 million fine in South Korea for the same thing. Then in January this year, Qualcomm was charged with anti-competitive practices in the US by the Federal Trade Commission. Why is Qualcomm suing Apple?  In its countersuit filed Monday [ PDF download], Qualcomm claims Apple deliberately slowed down its 4G LTE chips in the iPhone 7 to hide that Intel’s 4G LTE chips, which Apple also uses, performed far worse. The lawsuit also claims Apple encouraged “regulatory attacks” on Qualcomm’s business in different countries by “misrepresenting facts and making false statements.” Qualcomm didn’t specify a dollar amount in damages it’s seeking from Apple.  “Over the last 10 years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services,” Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies.” Certainly the most damning part of Qualcomm’s suit is its claims the iPhone maker deliberately slowed down Qualcomm chips to hide supposed inferior performance of chips made by Intel, which Apple also uses in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This allegation is supported  by data unearthed by researchers at Twin Prime Inc., a mobile app optimization company, and Cellular Insights, an independent organization that tests radio performance of consumer devices.  Speaking to Bloomberg in November 2016, Twin Prime’s head of product Gabriel Tavridis said, “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.”  Although no official reason was provided, the researchers speculated that Apple throttled CDMA Qualcomm chips found in Verizon and Sprint phones to match the slower performing Intel chips found in GSM iPhones (AT&T and T-Mobile) to create the illusion of equality among its phones.  This way, every iPhone 7 would perform the same across networks, even though iPhones sporting Qualcomm’s 4G LTE chips could perform better. For reference, Qualcomm’s X12 modem in the iPhone 7 is capable of downloading data at 600 Mbps, compared to the 450 Mbps of Intel’s modems.  This isn’t the first time Apple has used chips with differing performance. When the iPhone 6S came out in 2015, reviewers initially noticed some battery life differences between the iPhone 6S phones with TSMC-made chips and those with chips from Samsung. However, a later Consumer Reports test showed negligible performance differences between the chips. We’ve asked Apple and Qualcomm for comment on the lawsuits, and we’ll update this story if we hear back. What does all this mean for the iPhone?  Although we may not see the outcome of the Apple vs Qualcomm battle for some time, we can speculate what all this might mean for Apple and its iconic smartphone from here on out.  If Apple is successful in suing Qualcomm for monopolistic practices, we could potentially see cheaper iPhones since Apple doesn’t have to pay Qualcomm as much per device.  However, Apple also has to answer if it deliberately slowed down 4G performance in its Qualcomm-equipped iPhones in order to create performance parity across handsets. If this is true and in breach of contract with Qualcomm, Apple may have to pay a hefty fine.  In either case, it’s clear Apple and Qualcomm’s relationship won’t be the same moving forward. Apple may look for other chipmakers that can provide better value to help the company lower the price of its iPhones amidst tough competition from cheaper Android phones. Apple is already using Intel, but may seek out other chipmakers to prevent an over reliance on one manufacturer. With the iPhone 8 release around the corner, Apple may ditch Qualcomm’s LTE chips altogether for Intel’s new XMM 7650 chips, according to an AppleInsider report. The Intel chip is capable of up to 1 Gbps download speeds and up to 225 Mbps uploads, marking a 45% performance increase from the modems in the iPhone 7. The iPhone’s silicon future, it seems, is already starting to change. iPhone 8: all the latest news and rumors Related news 10 best gaming mice: best gaming mouse to buy Google Home now makes sure you never miss a flight Project Scorpio dev kit is so powerful, we wish it was the real thing Download of the day: AndreaMosaic See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / AMD’s Ryzen has not brought the price wars we all wanted/needed AMD’s Ryzen has not brought the price wars we all wanted/needed Paul Taylor 12 hours ago Channel, CPU, Featured Tech News As much as AMD’s Ryzen has seen the CPU underdog being thrust back into the race, how much of an impact has it really had on Intel’s thus-far dominant Core i7 and Core i7 processors? Using Camelcamelcamel.com‘s Amazon pricetracking tool, we’ve measured the changes in the US and UK, and our findings are a bit disappointing, to say the least. By far the introduction of Ryzen generated two currents of opinion: the first, a slightly fanboi-ish one, that AMD would dominate sales and performance and crush Intel thoroughly and, the second, that it would be a competitive product which would bring about cheaper Intel CPUs for those die-hard Intel fans who wouldn’t make the leap of faith. First, some things to consider before continuing to read: Intel’s Core i7 7700K and i5 7600K (i.e. Kaby Lake-S) are but a few months old, launched January 2017. Intel’s Core i7 6700K and i5 6600K (i.e. Skylake-S) have been on the market since August 2015. Intel’s Core i7 6900K and 6800K (i.e. Broadwell-E) have been around since May 2016. Ryzen 7 SKUs were launched on February 22nd (Amazon pre-order). Ryzen 5 is not included, as there are no metrics yet. We realise not everyone buys off Amazon, and you might find different prices elsewhere. This comparison is to be used as a general reference in a public forum which many users buy from. We looked back to the launch but also as far as the pricing engine would take us, to note seasonal price drops, if any. In the US, we saw that Intel CPU price drops happened just a day or two before the Ryzen launch, possibly enough to make one hesitate from a Ryzen insta-purchase. The drop itself was only really felt on the Core i7 6700K, which fell around $25. The remainder of Intel’s line-up (6600K, 6800K, 6900K, 7600K and 7700K) were afforded token drops as ‘high’ as $10. Today, you can see that some of these CPUs – the Core i7 7700K and Core i7 6700K – have increased ever so slightly in price since the Ryzen launch. In the UK, Intel’s CPUs were also afforded minor discounts on Amazon, happening a few days after Ryzen’s actual launch, instead. The interesting part is that Ryzen prices have kept on dropping since launch, and more than a little bit. The Ryzen 1700 has dropped £25, Ryzen 1700X fell £30 and the Ryzen 1800X has dropped a little over £15, but still higher than their US counterparts. So how much of an impact did Ryzen have? Well, a rather disappointing “much less than you’d expect”, it seems, if Amazon’s numbers are anything to measure it by. All in all, not what we expected, much less what consumers needed. Intel still seems bulletproof (or just too sure of itself) when it comes to pricing. Not even the 6800K and 6900K, the two CPUs which had the most share to lose to AMD’s higher-end 1800X, broke a sweat. Looking further back we can see that seasonal changes in pricing had a bigger impact on Intel’s pricing structure than Ryzen’s launch. A single Black Friday event, in late November 2016, had the Core i7 6700K going much cheaper than February 22nd 2017. One notable trend of Intel’s is a sharp increase in pricing in the week immediately after Christmas – likely a seasonal hike playing on consumers cashing in on all the extended family’s Christmas money gifts, Amazon Gift cards or simply returning presents they got during Christmas in exchange for the real goodies. Looking back at that historical (at least for AMD) date – February 22nd – we can see that Intel’s line-up had some slight changes that were hardly noticeable for US consumers. For UK consumers all is not lost. We have benefitted from a slight downward trend of the Ryzen 7 pricing, but overall the effect on Intel has been negligible. It seems we’re still in the doldrums when it comes to CPU pricing. KitGuru Says: In both camps, consumers had pinned their hopes for more affordable CPUs following AMD’s Ryzen launch. However, it seems that Intel’s pricing structure has seen little impact so far. Hopefully this is something that starts to change with time.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags AMD broadwell core i7 Intel kaby lake news pricing Ryzen skylake UK us Previous AMD Ryzen 1600X pushed to 5.9GHz with all cores and threads enabled Next Qualcomm hit with $815 million royalty refund to Blackberry Check Also FSP showcase new products, including coolers.

Raphael Silva ✔️ This is exactly what i said couple days ago, Intel isnt giving a damn about Ryzen so far and honestly it never cared, Intel always kept their prices, not huge discounts cause OMG they have something competitive. Rex Lajos A better offer doesn’t scare Intel unless people start buying it. They should worry when itx motherboards toll out for am4. Saurabh Harwande Intel are fucking shit. They don’t give discount to us, they will pay other companies to use intel instead of AMD that is how they compete. They never gave a shit about the consumer and never will. They just want profits and that’s how they will be. luke Reviewers opinions of Ryzen 5 are overwhelming and thankfully most consumers read those over these sort of news stories. Intel can do nothing, even if they lower prices it still won’t be good enough. If you want twice as much horsepower for your money you buy Ryzen, if you think Intel will lower prices to compete you will be waiting a while. Amazon sales does not equal total sales. Tyrann Ya i kept checking to buy Ryzen pc’s from Dell for our company and still can’t find any. Tyrann They won’t start worrying until companies like Dell, Lenovo and HP make Ryzen pc’s for companies to buy. Dave Bristel Until Intel sees sales drop, they won’t do anything when it comes to product prices. It is too soon to see significant changes in sales because HP, Lenovo, and Dell do not sell Ryzen based products in their mainstream lineups. AMD made the point that Ryzen would go out to the enthusiast and normal distribution channels FIRST, rather than letting the OEMs hold the products hostage, so the big question is when these OEMs will start to sell Ryzen based systems. It may be the obvious issues with the new AM4 platform where we see new BIOS versions come out monthly, if not more often, or a shortage of motherboards(you can’t even get a Crosshair VI hero from Newegg at this point). How long will it take for motherboards to be manufactured for the OEMs? Dave Bristel AMD made the point that Ryzen would go out to the enthusiast and normal distribution channels FIRST, rather than letting the OEMs hold the products hostage, so the big question is when these OEMs will start to sell Ryzen based systems. Caleb White yeah where I work (programming and some IT), we order everything from Dell. Our ‘Engineering’ PCs cost like $3000 and have a GeForce Quadro4000 in them and some decent Xeon. But a quadro 4000? that thing is weak as shit and I know our company is paying up the ass for them…or are they? Online the 4000 is expensive and a completely illogical purchase considering its age and power, but perhaps Nvidia gives some massive discount. Still, my PC at home with a 290X would probably do better in MOST workloads we do here. To add to it, my co-workers seem to think all i5s and i7s are the best, when in reality they have the 2C4T mobile i7s in their Thinkpads while I, the Co-Op, have the ‘old slow computer’ (Dell Optiplex 7010) with a i7-3770 256G 850Evo and 16Gb of DDR3. My pc kicks their laptop’s in performance, but since it’s a few years older they seem to think it’s undesirable: lucky for me I guess lol. Filthy Casuals haha luke Use that voice of yours at work. AMD deserve a voice with great products like these. You will get a nice bonus when you prove you are right. luke Within the next month. Alex Ray all this tells me is that i should support AMD and go ryzen when i finally upgrade from my 2500k. Ares I bought into a 1700, at 3.8 ghz it doubles the single core performance of my 8320E at 4.4 ghz quadibloc Well, the upcoming Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X chips show that Intel is not ignoring AMD. Because the Ryzen doesn’t quite beat Intel’s very best chips in single-core performance, it hasn’t quite forced Intel’s hand. But the fact that one can get an eight-core Ryzen for so much less than anything comparable from Intel is almost all the price war we need. Sinner85 “It seems we’re still in the doldrums when it comes to CPU pricing.” No we’re not, it’s called Ryzen,its cheaper and better in most scenarios??? Evettejstrand Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Published on April 12, 2017. 0 AMD has announced its new mid-range offerings in direct competition with Intel’s Core i5 and It boasts some strong points in comparison with its competitor. At $250, the Ryzen 5 1600X has six cores and twelve threads comprised of AMD’s newest microarchitecture. This is in comparison with the Core i5, which only has four cores and no threading. Although based the Core i5 is based on the Kaby Lake and will host an instructions-per-clock strong point, it is still a difficult climb for it since its competitor has 50% extra cores and twice the number of threads. In contrast with the Ryzen 7, which was released as a competitor against 2 Generation Old Intel CPUs, the Ryzen 5 will be squaring off against Intel’s latest and leading designs. Market prices for the more mid-tier processes are more sensitive than the others and as such, AMD is launching Ryzen 5 at a similar price to its Intel contender.  AMD seems to be trying to fight it off in terms of quality rather than prices, by offering more threads and more cores. As far as memory is concerned, Ryzen 5 will support DDR4 ECC and also Non-ECC, and the memory support that Ryzen 7 had will be the same. The Ryzen 5 1600X sits at a price tag of $249 and is competing directly with the i5-7600K which is priced at $242. Tests have shown that the AMD will not win much when it comes to single-threaded processes but the situation changes with multi-threading comes into play. We are the situation right now where manufacturers of motherboards are completely overwhelmed by AMD motherboards. Due to this, distributors are starting to build up stocks on various models. For the Ryzen 5, AMD will be setting up the B350 chipset as its base for motherboards, particularly when it’s compared with Intel’s b250 motherboards for the Kaby Lake processors.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Wish list: What I’d like to see in a new iMac Roman Loyola 12 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News When Apple met with select members of the media to talk about the Mac Pro, Apple VPs also mentioned that the company plans to update the iMac this year. The gap between updates for the iMac isn’t as long as the Mac Pro, but it’s been a while. The current iMac was released in October of 2015, well past the yearly updates Apple used to issue. So the iMac is due. Pike’s Universum, which has an eagle eye for finding references to future Apple products in Apple’s operating system code, reported on some specs that could be used for the new iMac—though the site says that the information should be “handled with care/skepticism.” I’ll point out Pike’s findings in each section below, along with my commentary. The latest CPUs Pike’s Universum says that the high-end iMac could have an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. This is a Xeon processor that’s not on Intel’s E3 v6 Family list, so you can either dismiss it as not true, or it could be a processor not yet developed. Intel does have older Xeon processors with the E3-1285 part number, so it does seem feasible. Intel released the E3-1200 v6 processor family in late March, so if there’s any credence to Pike’s report, it checks a box on my iMac wish list: that Apple use current CPUs, not ones that are a generation behind. It’ll be interesting if Apple decides to go with a quad-core Xeon processor, which is used in professional workstations. During the Mac Pro briefing, the iMac was mentioned as being used by professionals, and since a ship date for the future Mac Pro has not been announced, Apple could want to fill the professional demand in the meantime by offering a super fast iMac. Apple offers multiple models of the iMac, with 21.5- and 27-inch display. You’ll probably see Core i5 or Core i7 processors in the 21.5-inch iMacs, and then a Xeon processor in the 27-inch model. Let’s hope those Core processors are from Intel’s 7th generation. 16GB of memory   Besides the fast performance, another reason for using a Xeon processor in the high-end iMac is its support for Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM. ECC RAM has a chip that’s dedicated to finding and fixing memory errors. Standard RAM doesn’t have this capability, but it’s also less expensive. So you should experience fewer memory errors when using EEC RAM. What I’d like to see with the iMac is a standard configuration of 16GB of memory. Currently, it’s at 8GB. I’d also like to see Apple make the RAM user accessible on all iMac models, not just on the high-end 27-incher, so you can upgrade to 32GB or 64GB at a later date. Make Fusion Drives standard A solid-state drive would be great because of the speed benefits, but it’s expensive and will drive the price of the iMac up. Apple currently stocks 1TB hard drives in its standard configurations of the iMac, and a 1TB SSD would be really pricey. Pike’s Universum says that the new high-end iMac could have an NVMe SSD, which would be awesome, but there’s still a price consideration for the lower-priced iMacs.   A good compromise would be to make a 1TB Fusion Drive standard. A Fusion Drive is a hard drive that’s combined with flash storage and seen on the Mac and a single storage device. This provides fast file access and spacious file storage. A Fusion Drive upgrade for the current iMac is only $100. Hopefully Apple could find a way to offset the cost of making it a part of the standard configuration. Easier to access ports Apple puts its iMac ports on the back, because they’re ugly and they ruin the aesthetic of the iMac’s front appearance. If you need to regularly access those ports, however, it’s annoying. You have to reach around and scrape up the back of the iMac as you try to fit a connector into a port. Or you have to move the iMac itself, which can be disruptive if you have a special hardware setup. But Apple won’t move the ports from the back. Maybe they have data that shows that it’s not really an issue. Maybe the data they have says customers want a change, but Apple doesn’t care, it’s sticking to its design. I can wish, but I know that in this case, it won’t happen. Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and USB 3 Here’s a wish that has a really good chance of coming true. I can easily see Apple replacing the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the current iMac with Thunderbolt 3/USB-C on the new iMac. I hope Apple retains the other ports on the back of the iMac: USB 3, ethernet, the headphone jack, and the SD card slot. I don’t see a reason for Apple to eliminate these ports, but I can also see Apple deciding to offer only Thunderbolt 3, and then telling people that you can use a dock like CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite ($200 on Amazon). That would mean paying extra money for something that used to be included. But on the bright side, a dock addresses my issue with port access. External GPU support The iMac’s all-in-one design limits the type of GPU that can be used. You can’t use one that generates a lot of heat. But if lots of pros are using iMacs, a pro-class GPU accessible externally would address the needs of graphically-demanding apps. An external GPU is also on my wish list for the Mac Pro. In that article, I said that an external GPU is the type of product you usually wouldn’t see from Apple, but if it can be used by any Mac, it makes it more feasible. And as I noted in the Mac Pro wish list, macOS needs some updating to support an external GPU.

Last year Intel was the top brand in the global server SSD market, holding a commanding 30 percent market share. Can the company maintain that in the face of competition from the likes of Samsung and Toshiba? By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | April 12, 2017 -- 13:02 GMT (06:02 PDT) | Topic: Storage Intel Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X According to DRAMeXchange, Intel was the top brand in the global server SSD market during 2016, holding a commanding 30 percent market share, a position it gained through the leveraging of its dominance in the processor market. what's hot on zdnet Microsoft confirms Spring launch is on for May 2 in New York City Recently patched Microsoft Word exploit was used by both governments and criminal hackers Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' 2017 annual letter: What decision-makers can learn Windows XP: Why it won't die for years to come But all's not well as the likes of Samsung and Toshiba gain experience and make use of aggressive pricing to erode that market shares for mid-range and low-end server SSDs. Can Optane SSD DC P4800X allow Intel to keep its lead in the server storage market? According to DRAMeXchange, the answer is yes. Must read: Apple's desperate Mac damage control message hints at a divided company "3D XPoint greatly outperforms NAND Flash and will help Intel reinforce its leading position in the high-end segment of the SSD market that has become increasingly competitive," said Alan Chen, senior research manager of DRAMeXchange, a division of TrendForce. "In the future, the product roadmap of 3D XPoint could include client-grade SSDs and storage-class memory (SCM) devices. Intel naturally wants to expand the adoption of this technology in other areas as to create flexibility in pricing and consumption of in-house production capacity." "Intel lags behind Samsung and Toshiba in the production capacity for NAND Flash," added Chen. "Putting forward a new premium SSD line that uses a proprietary memory technology is a way for Intel to maintain high profit margin for its server business with limited NAND Flash capacity. Furthermore, the introduction of 3D XPoint will help Intel reduce the risk of being overly reliant on the high-end server SSD market." The price per gigabyte of a 375GB SSD from the DC P4800X Series is about four times that of a NAND Flash-based SSD -- working out at approximately $4 per gigabyte -- with similar specifications and PCIe interface. However, compared to the average sales price of server DRAM DIMMs, which currently hovers around $7 per gigabyte, Optane is quite competitive From a performance perspective, Optane SSDs can hit 2,400MB/s for sequential reading, and 2,200MB/s for sequential writing, or over 500,000 when measured in IOPS. While being more expensive than NAND PCIe SSDs, SSDs using 3D XPoint offer several advantages. The random read and write speeds are faster and more consistent, latency is much lower, and overall endurance is much improved. According to Chen, while 3D XPoint-based SSDs lack the performance capability to fully substitute server DRAM DIMMs, the DC P4800X Series can be used alongside server DRAM DIMMs to improve the operation of the entire server system. Intel will follow up its 375GB storage product with future 750GB and 1.5TB versions.

Qualcomm today filed its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple’s January lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of California. The full details of the suit can be read in a 139-page document (PDF) released by Qualcomm, but the company has five key complaints — including the claim that Apple deliberately didn’t use the full potential of Qualcomm chips in iPhone 7 phones so that they wouldn’t perform better than the modems provided by Intel. Qualcomm says that Apple “chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm’s innovation),” and when Qualcomm iPhones supposedly outperformed Intel iPhones, “Apple falsely claimed that there was ‘no discernible difference’ between” the two variants. The company also says that Apple prevented it from revealing to customers “the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets.” As part of its five core arguments, Qualcomm says Apple “threatened” it to keep quiet about the differences between Intel and Qualcomm iPhones, preventing Qualcomm from “making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.” READ  Microsoft Releases Fifth Windows 10 Preview In A Row With Only Bug Fixes And Improvements Other complaints in the countersuit include claims that Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm, encouraged attacks on the company in a number of markets by misrepresenting facts and making false statements, and interfered with Qualcomm’s existing agreements with other companies. Apple’s original suit against Qualcomm was filed in January this year in the United States, and claimed $1 billion from the chipmaker, arguing that it had been drastically overcharging for the use of patents. That was followed up by two additional suits — one in China and one in the United Kingdom — that also focused on patents and designs. A case filed in Beijing claimed 1 billion yuan ($145 million) for Qualcomm’s abuse of China’s monopoly laws. Tim Cook said that Apple had “no choice” but to sue Qualcomm, even after the two companies had worked together for many years, saying that he and his company “didn’t see another way forward.” According to Cook, Qualcomm was “insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,” collecting money on features like Apple’s TouchID fingerprint readers and cameras. READ  Tech Proving A Real Game-Changer For Growth in Africa The Apple suits came after the Federal Trade Commission filed its own litigation against Qualcomm in January. The FTC also took umbrage against Qualcomm’s use of its patents: specifically, how it wouldn’t sell modems to companies who didn’t also agree to pay royalties on phones that didn’t use Qualcomm modems. As part of the FTC’s case, some of the chipmaker’s other behind-the-scenes deals also came to light — including a 2007 agreement with Apple that saw Qualcomm refund some patent royalties if Apple promised not to make a WiMAX phone. In today’s countersuit, Qualcomm says it seeks — among other things — damages from Apple for “reneging on its promises in several agreements,” and to stop Apple interfering in deals with manufacturers for iPhone and iPad parts.

Ecohz is a market leader in the certification of renewable electricity supply in Europe. “Since COP21 in Paris in 2015, the big corporate companies have moved centre stage in the climate and energy agenda,” Lindberg said. “Big businesses are now setting more ambitious targets than cities or governments. This is about making collective change.” Stemming from the Paris Pledge for Action 2015, recent initiatives including RE100, WeMeanBusiness and Science Based Targets are working with leading corporations to set sustainability targets, such as a commitment to source 100 percent of electricity demand from renewable sources (RE100). With corporate energy consumers accounting for about 50 percent of global electricity demand, these initiatives aim at spearheading a major shift in the global renewable energy market. “By grouping together, these huge corporates can punch above their weight and send a positive market signal to producers,” Sam Kimmins, head of corporate campaign at RE100, said during the 2017 RECS Market Meeting.[Native Advertisement] RECs play an important part in achieving these targets, currently accounting for 54-59 percent of voluntary demand for green power procurement. RECs markets are well-established in North America and in Europe. However, for major corporations with a global presence, finding localized sustainability solutions can be a challenge. Intel Corp. purchased over 4 billion kWh of green power in 2016, compared with an estimated overall energy consumption of around 6.5 billion kWh/year. Marty Sedler, director global utilities and infrastructure at Intel explains the overall strategy: “Intel uses a portfolio approach to cleaner energy management, and Guarantees of Origin(GO), Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and International RECS (I-RECS) are an essential part of the portfolio approach. But first, we look for the best technology available in the region or the locality, and then we look at the grid. Our preference is for local technology solutions with multi-stakeholder buy-in. We’re not going to buy Norwegian hydro credits for our operations in Ireland.”  “We’re here to meet and coordinate with all the players and help us create the markets outside of Europe and the U.S. — because we [Intel] are everywhere, and renewables are not yet everywhere,” Sedler added. During the RECs Market Meeting, market analysts for Europe and North America were upbeat in their outlooks. Highlighting increased demand in the compliance market, such as California’s target of 50 percent renewables by 2030, and Oregon aiming at 50 percent by 2040, Scott Eidson, vice president-environmental markets at 3Degrees also anticipates strong growth in the voluntary market. “The voluntary market growth could be in contrast to the direction of federal policy” in the North American market, Eidson said. William Dixon with Agder Energi, the third largest utility in Norway, said of the European market, “There’s potential for this to get a lot higher.” Dixon cited factors influencing supply and demand, such as the expansion of the European Energy Certificate System (EECS); regulatory change, including the GO auctions proposed in the EU’s Clean Energy Package; and consumer/regional preferences.  Nigel Topping, CEO of the WeMeanBusiness coalition congratulated the “heroic entrepreneurs in the room” and noted that climate pledges made by local and regional authorities through the Under 2⁰ MOU represented “a rich vein of market development.” Jared Bralawsky, secretary general, RECS International, said: “What we are seeing is that the end users, the big corporations and citizens are driving the low carbon transition. Now our work is more about supporting the consumers’ choice: the consumer is looking for reliable renewable energy procurement options around the world.” *Renewable energy certificates (RECs) are tradable and non-tangible commodities that enable energy consumers to verify that their electricity is generated by renewable energy sources. Each certificate corresponds to one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced by a power station. Different types of RECs include: International RECs (I-RECs), GoldPower, European Guarantees of Origin (GOs), Gos with EKOEnergy label, GOs with Naturemade star label, GOs with OK Power label, North American RECs and North American RECs with Green-e Energy label.  Sponsored Content is made possible by our sponsor; it does not necessarily reflect the views of our editorial staff.

Compared to traditional UCFF PCs, these business use-cases require ease of management and administration by IT staff. Intel supplies a set of features under the vPro tag for this purpose. This is enabled on select CPU SKUs. OEMs also have limited options for certain components such as the LAN controller. ECS launched the LIVA Z Plus earlier this year, and it was one of the first Kaby Lake UCFF PCs to come with a vPro SKU. Introduction and Product Impressions UCFF PCs have traditionally catered to the consumer market. We have seen a few systems from the likes of Logic Supply, and even Intel itself, that cater to the business and industrial PC segment. The key here is the use of a CPU with the vPro features enabled. Such systems have usually carried a premium compared to their home consumer-targeted counterparts. The LIVA series of UCFF PCs from ECS has made a mark in the market by focusing on the value segment. While a majority of the LIVA models have been based on the Atom platform, ECS has tried to expand its reach with the LIVA Core (based on Broadwell-Y) and the LIVA One (mini-STX platform based on Skylake). The LIVA Z Plus from ECS brings Kaby Lake-U to the table with vPro enabled. The platform feature set and pricing, as is usual with ECS, makes it target the developing markets. The LIVA Z Plus comes 'barebones' in the sense that the end-user only needs to supply the OS. The system has two DDR4 SODIMM slots, with one 4GB SO-DIMM installed. A M.2 2242 SATA / PCIe SSD slot is available, and ECS supplies a 128GB SATA SSD in the sole SKU that is planned for the retail market. That SKU comes with a Core i5-7300U, but ECS is also ready to equip the systems with either a Core i3-7100U or Celeron 3965U. However, those two variants are not vPro-capable. In terms of external appearance and I/O ports, the ECS LIVA Z Plus is the same as the ECS LIVA Z that we reviewed a few weeks back. However, the internals are very different. While the LIVA Z could get away with passive cooling thanks to the 6W TDP Apollo Lake SoC, the LIVA Z Plus integrates a fan to keep the 15W TDP Core i5-7300U within the appropriate thermal limits. The vPro platform makes it necessary for ECS to use an Intel LAN controller. While the LIVA Z integrated two Realtek LAN controllers, the LIVA Z Plus uses an Intel I219-LM and a Realtek LAN controller for the two GbE ports. The WLAN component in the LIVA Z Plus is also a much improved one - a 2x2 Intel AC8260, compared to the 1x1 Intel AC3165 in the LIVA Z. While the LIVA Z was equipped with 32GB eMMC and 4GB DDR3 RAM, the LIVA Z Plus comes with a 128GB M.2 SATA SSD and 4GB of DDR4 RAM. ECS sampled us a pre-production engineering sample of the LIVA Z Plus. The key differences compared to the version slated to ship eventually were an out-of-date ME firmware and system BIOS (that prevented us from testing vPro features such as Intel AMT etc.). The full specifications of our review configuration are summarized in the table below. ECS LIVA Z Plus Specifications Processor Intel Core i5-7300U Kaby Lake, 2C/4T, 2.6 GHz (Turbo to 3.5 GHz). 14nm+, 3 MB L2, 15W TDP Memory Transcend TS512MSH64V4H DDR4 15-15-15-35 @ 2133 MHz 1x4 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Disk Drive(s) Transcend TS128GMTS400 (512 GB; M.2 Type 2242 SATA III; 20nm; MLC NAND) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 (2x2 802.11ac - 866 Mbps) 1x Intel I219-LM Gigabit LAN 1x Realtek RTL8168/8111 Gigabit LAN Audio 3.5mm Headphone Jack Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Display 1x HDMI 1.4a 1x mini-DisplayPort 1.2 Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x USB 3.0 Type-C Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing (As configured) $489 Full Specifications ECS LIVA Z Plus Specifications The ECS LIVA Z Plus package comes with a 65W (19V @ 3.42A) AC adapter and a VESA mount / screws in addition to the main unit. Windows 10 is the only officially supported OS, and all the drivers were downloaded on our review unit from the ECS website. One of the interesting hardware components in the LIVA Z Plus is the integrated digital microphone (similar to the LIVA Z). This allows the end user to configure it as an always-listening machine (if needed), without the need to connect an external microphone. The other selling point is the availability of two GbE RJ-45 ports. While one port uses an Intel Ethernet controller, ECS has taken the cost factor into consideration and opted for a Realtek controller behind the second port. Gallery: ECS LIVA Z Plus - Chassis Design & Internals The industrial design is attractive and the unit feels solid. The chassis is made of plastic (not uncommon at the targeted price point). The internal thermal design (pictured in the above gallery) involves heat drawn away from the main package via two heat pipes to a finned heat sink. A miniature fan is attached to the underside of the chassis top to blow air through the heat sink. There are vents on either side of the chassis, but, it is not clear if the vents are engineered in a way that allows inlet air flow in conjunction with the fan's placement. In any case, we will take a look at the effectiveness of the thermal design in a later section. The Kaby Lake-U platform is very similar to that of Skylake-U. We have discussed the distribution of the high-speed I/O lanes in many reviews in the past. The relevant aspect here is the way the lanes are utilized in the ECS LIVA Z Plus. Note that the PCIe lanes used for the M.2 slot are not reported here since the system was configured with a SATA SSD.

Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the ECS LIVA Z Plus when we come to those sections.

Reply Cygni - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link Haven't been announced yet, but "M" series Raven Ridge processors are expected to be in the 15W window. Raven Ridge will also have "U" series mainstream mobile APUs (if we assume comperable TDP to Intel designs, perhaps this is 28W), and "H" series high end mobile APUs (perhaps 45W) Reply Shadowmaster625 - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link They now have VESA mount notebook trays for $20. Zip ties cost 5 cents. So why buy this when you can buy a i5 notebook for the same price, and mount it onto the back of your display? That way you get a faster processor, a free backup screen, and best of all, a free UPS. Reply npz - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link What? A bulky notebook mounted on the back of monitor? With zip ties? Also, your notebook won't have the ports, and it won't have vPro. And this is a *permanent* desktop solution. I can't believe you're suggesting a notebook to be used like this. If you really need a backup screen, you keep a spare monitor in the closet. If you need a UPS, you buy a UPS. Then you can use it with multiple systems. Reply BrokenCrayons - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link Though I find it fun to repurpose hardware in somewhat unusual ways, if someone needs a desktop solution with vPro, the LIVA Z Plus seems like a reasonable solution and probably a better option than a laptop that's zip tied to the back of a monitor. Reply dispo-k - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link Genuine question: why have so many of the reviews posted lately be these USFF barebones kits? I'm not knocking them, but I always thought they were more of a low end desktop for people who preferred the smaller form factor over performance or cost, and obviously for people using them purely for media like a HTPC. Have these systems grown in popularity or are they used in a wider range of applications than I realize? Reply dispo-k - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link Apologies. After reading a number of these lately, I F'd up and didn't read the article before posting. These are apparently popular enterprise solutions, and given that IT admins are likely one of the target demographics for this site, it makes perfect sense that they'd be interested in this type of content. Sorry for not RTFA before posting. I didn't see an option to delete my original post. Reply SquarePeg - Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - link Nice save!

It’s quiet, too Conclusion Show More How long has it been since you could buy an off-the-shelf PC that’ll hit 5GHz? Too long. But your wait is finally over. Wrapped in an elegant and truly unique case, the Digital Storm Velox at last gives the consumer a rig that breaks the magical 5GHz barrier right out of the box.  What’s inside Inside are top-of-the-line parts that include a pair of EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs in SLI mode, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a ludicrously fast 512GB Samsung 960 Pro M.2 NVMe drive, 3TB Toshiba hard drive, an Asus Maximus IX Hero motherboard and the star: Intel’s new Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K CPU. Mentioned in this article Samsung 960 PRO Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6P1T0BW) $605.47MSRP $629.99View on Amazon If you read my review of the Kaby Lake desktop chip, you’ll know that it’s an unexciting upgrade over Skylake. That, of course, won’t be too much of a surprise if you’ve also read my review of the laptop version that came out first. [ Further reading: These 20 absorbing PC games will eat days of your life ] However, desktops aren’t laptops. And one thing Kaby Lake offers is higher overclocks than Skylake, Haswell, or Ivy Bridge could ever dream of. Don’t believe it? Digital Storm shipped our Velox with the CPU pushed up from its stock base clock of 4.2GHz to 5GHz. That may not sound like much, especially when considering that the top-end Kaby Lake has a Turbo Boost speed of 4.5GHz. But we haven’t seen a full-time 5GHz overclock since the days of Intel’s Sandy Bridge CPU, introduced in 2011. Monica Lee The Digital Storm Velox uses a custom-designed case.  While you might think such a feat requires the use of a pricey custom liquid-cooling setup, Digital Storm wields an off-the-shelf Corsair H115i cooler. Yes, it’s a beefy cooler using a pair of 140mm fans on a 240mm radiator, but it’s a far cry from custom water cooling in complexity and cost. Sleek looks As flashy as its 5GHz CPU and cutting-edge parts are, much of the Velox’s charm is actually in its presentation. For example, you won’t be able to buy this mid-tower case anywhere else. It’s a custom, in-house design by Digital Storm along the lines of the company’s flagship Aventum 3. Rather than pressed out in quantities to fill a container ship, the case is produced in smaller volumes locally. For the time being, anyway: Digital Storm said it’s moving production overseas this year. I do have a few nitpicks about the case. The main one is the plastic case window, which bucks the current fashion trend of tempered glass. I’m a fan of glass, as it’s less likely to scratch and is easy to clean to perfection. Plastic just doesn’t shine up as well. In the past, Digital Storm has said it chooses plastic on some cases based on feedback from its own customers. Apparently those customers say they’d rather have a little dust than have their side panel break into smithereens. That’s fair, but certainly not as sexy.  The door also can be fussy when reattaching it. While it’s easy to remove and doesn’t require you to learn the Dragon’s Quest secret move to get it back on (it pins in place), sometimes the door’s lightweight material doesn’t snap back into shape. You may find yourself pounding on each corner to get it to sit flush. Performance A pretty case isn’t enough when it comes to beefy desktops. You have to back it up with performance. Cinebench R15 multi-threaded performance Our first test is Maxon’s Cinebench R15. It’s a CPU-centric test that renders a 3D image using the same engine as the company’s Cinema4D application. Professional 3D rendering has always favored more cores and more threads, so it’s no surprise that the top dog here is the Core i7-6950X in the Aventum 3 system. Even at 5GHz, the quad-core Core i7-7700K can’t touch the 10 cores in the Core i7-6950X, nor the 8-core chip in the Origin PC Omni all-in-one. PCWorld Even at 5GHz, the quad-core in the Velox can’t out-muscle the 8-core and 10-core systems. Cinebench R15 single-threaded performance But remember, the world isn’t all about multi-threading performance. In fact, the vast majority of games, applications, and Windows itself doesn’t benefit as much from an 8-core or 10-core chip as you'd expect. Once you hit a reasonable number of cores, such as four, the actual clock speed can often matter more. To see how the Velox would perform in most games and apps, we also ran Cinebench R15 in its single-threaded test mode. This stresses just one CPU core and all but neutralizes that 10-core i7-6950X. In this mode of use, you can see the Digital Storm Velox and its Kaby Lake chip have a 25-percent performance advantage over the 10-core chip. The hard reality of the PC: These days, this situation applies in the vast majority of applications and games. PCWorld Sure, that 10-core makes you feel good, but the 5GHz Kaby Lake in the Digital Storm Velox will likely be faster in a sizeable majority of things you actually run. Handbrake encoding performance The thing is, when multi-threading matters, it matters. Even free and popular encoding applications such as Handbrake clearly show the advantage of a 10-core or 8-core machine. You can expect to see a similar increase in performance with Adobe Premiere Elements and other media-heavy, multi-threaded apps when using a CPU with more than four cores.  PCWorld You can’t entirely ignore the performance benefit of having more than 4 cores, because when it does matter, it’ll matter a lot. 3DMark Fire Strike Extreme graphics performance You don’t buy an elegant box like the Velox to get excited about a video transcode. You want to know how it hammers out frames per second. In this category, the Velox and its pair of air-cooled EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 cards represent well. Using Futuremark’s Fire Strike Extreme benchmark, we looked at the graphics subset of the overall score so we could focus just on the performance of the GPUs. Even without the exotic custom liquid cooling of its larger sibling, the Velox holds its own. Its pair of air-cooled GPUs matches the liquid-cooled cards in the Aventum 3. It’s en vogue to dump on multi-card setups, but the performance you get can’t be questioned most of the time. The $1,200 pair of video cards in the Velox bests the single $1,200 Titan X Pascal in the Origin PC Omni. SLI haters, take that! At least until we've seen seen Nvidia’s newest Titan Xp Pascal card. PCWorld caption Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor performance The Velox cruises along in more than just synthetic benchmarks: When we ran Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor at 4K UHD resolution with the 4K textures installed, the Velox hammered out 113 fps on average. Not too shabby, even though the liquid-cooled set of GTX 1080s in the Aventum 3 still pulls out a win. We ran other games as well, but we’ll spare you the dirty details and say that the Velox comfortably runs modern games in 4K at high resolution and high settings. PCWorld The custom-liquid cooling powering the Digital Storm Aventum 3 has an advantage in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. How stable of an overclock is it? When it comes to overclocking, stability is always a concern. The problem is precisely how to define stable overclocking. Some will call an overclock stable if it can run a game for three hours without crashing, while others will accept only a 24-hour run of Prime95 or another torture test as proof of stability. The first is a fairly easy hurdle, while the second is incredibly brutal. We typically don’t run additional stress tests on overclocked systems, but we did for the Velox. Because it’s the first 5GHz PC we’ve seen in a long while, we wanted to see how stable it was out of the box. We ran right into the “it depends on what the definition of stable is” debate. The Velox ran all of our standard tests without a hiccup, but running Prime95’s Torture Test for about 30 minutes would cause one core to drop out. Fail? Not necessarily. The Velox passed multiple runs of our multi-threaded Handbrake encoding test without issue, and in an actual use case, I performed a 10-run batch of encoding on the machine without an issue. That’s basically an afternoon of pegging all of the CPU cores without a crash or problem. Intel’s own XTU stress test also ran just fine. Perhaps what matters most is Digital Storm’s opinion on the matter and how it stands behind the product. Basically, the company’s selling it to you at 5GHz and will stand behind it. That’s the key difference. You or I coaxing a chip to 5GHz and calling it a day is one thing. To run a business that sells 5GHz PCs is another thing. Of course, all this hinges on whether Digital Storm—and other PC vendors—will actually be able to get enough chips that can hit 5GHz, but all signs point to that certainty. It’s quiet, too One thing I should add about the Velox is that it’s quiet. I mean essentially dead-silent, even under heavy CPU loads. If you hear someone say that keeping Kaby Lake at high clock speeds will sound like a diesel engine, they’re wrong. The Velox proves it. Conclusion The Velox isn’t cheap, of course. With its custom-designed, damn-near artisanal case, high-gloss paint, and assortment of class-leading parts, the asking price of $4,737, however justified, still isn’t easy to swallow. And that’s without the custom cooling option, which brings us to the $5,000 range. The spectre of Ryzen 7 and all of its cores at a lower price does hover in the background, but for gaming (for now), single-threading is still the king. Until we see evidence that a Ryzen rig can ace Kaby Lake, the Velox and its 7th-gen CPU is the one to beat. Especially since you get head-turning looks without the typical “gaming” look of a 1990s Transformer toy.

And Ryzen 5 looks like it will be even better, compared to its main rivals: mainstream Intel Core i5 microprocessors and some of the low-end Intel Core i7 parts. The Ryzen 5 will weigh in at between $169 and $249, or around £170 to £250 in the UK, including the 20 per cent protection money demanded by Her Majesty. The Ryzen 5 will form the mainstream part of the market, and early reviews and benchmarks of pre-release parts suggest that it will be highly competitive. Indeed, a number of enthusiast websites have been quick off the mark with reviews and benchtests, with the Ryzen 5 performing well against more highly priced Intel parts. Tom's Hardware has reviewed the top-end Ryzen 5 part, the Ryzen 5 1600X, pitting it against the Ryzen 7 1700, as well as the Intel Core i5 7600K. Both were benchmarked at stock speeds, as well as overclocked to the max, although it also notes that overclocking the Ryzen 5, like with the Ryzen 7, tops out at "somewhere between 3.9 and 4.1 GHz", while the Intel Core i5 7600K can be overclocked to 5GHz. But the Ryzen 5 does pretty well: "The six-core Ryzen 5 1600X can work on three times as many threads than Intel's Core i5s, so it easily trumps the competition in the parallelized physics metric. AMD's 1600X also ekes past the Ryzen 7 1700 in Futuremark's DX11 physics test." But falls short in some of the same tests that the Ryzen 7 disappointed in: "The Ryzen 5 1600X is competitive in some API overhead tests, such as the DX12 benchmark where it leverage its extra threads. "However, Kaby Lake's IPC throughput advantage shines through in the DX11 overhead tests. The Ryzen 5 falls behind Intel's Core i5 family during the DX11 single- and multi-threaded workloads, even with the help of an overclock. That helps explain Intel's oft-superior frame rates in real-world game tests." Indeed, when the Ryzen 5 and the Core i5 7600K are pitted against each other in benchmarks running Battlefield 1, Ashes of the Singularity, and Civilisation VI, the Ryzen 5 generally loses out, especially when the Core i5 is overclocked to 5GHz. But, clocked or overclocked, the Ryzen 5 still puts in a good shift (and knocks spots off the old AMD FX-8370). If you really, really, really want an AMD Ryzen microprocessor in your next PC, suggests Tom's Hardware, the 1600X is the one to go for - although while it comes close, it generally doesn't quite beat Intel's Core i5 7600K. It's still early days, though, and as software is optimised and manufacturing of GlobalFoundries' 14nm process improves, the small gap may be further narrowed. Hot Hardware, meanwhile, conducted a series of mainstream benchmarks and tests of the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X and 1500X, and was impressed with both parts.  "The two Ryzen 5 series processors we tested performed well throughout our entire battery of tests. Despite its lower cost, the 4C/8T Ryzen 5 1500X competed very well with the four core/four thread Core i5-7600. In single and lightly threaded tests, the Kaby Lake-based Core i5 usually had an edge, but the 1500X was never too far behind. "In multi-threaded workloads like Blender, Cinebench, or 3DMark Physics, however, the Ryzen 5 1500X's support for SMT allowed it to jump out to significant leads over the Core i5." "The six core/12 thread Ryzen 5 1600X is slightly pricier than the Core i5-7600, but the 1600X's two additional cores, higher clocks, and support for SMT push its performance into a different category and easily justify the cost. The Ryzen 5 1600X's performance was often better than the Core i7-7700K, which is particularly evident in the multi-threaded tests." However, in single-threaded tests, Hot Hardware noted, the Intel Core i7 7700K is typically faster. "All things considered, Ryzen 5, particularly when paired to a B350 motherboard (some of which can be found for as low at $80), represents a very good value," concluded Hot Hardware. Although you can overclock to 1.45v, it added, 1.35v is probably the maximum voltage for long-term overclocking. In a series of benchmarks published by the enthusiast website HardOCP.com, the entry-level Ryzen 5 1400 overclocked to 4GHz more-or-less matched Intel's Core i5 7600K running at 5GHz - despite the AMD part coming in at just under £60 less than the Intel part, which is popular with overclockers and gamers. The Ryzen 5 1600, also overclocked to 4GHz, also edged out the Core i7 7700K, overclocked to 5GHz, according to the HardOCP benchmarks. It was more positive than Hot Hardware: "I like the Ryzen 5 1600. I like it a lot. AMD is delivering a lot of desktop processing power for the money," it concluded. 2017 is a busy year for AMD as it bids to make up lost ground against Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs. But so far, it looks to be keeping up (more or less) to its promise. Regardless of what happens, the launch of the microprocessors has already stimulated price cuts in the market - first to AMD's legacy products, where prices have been slashed, but vendors such as Ebuyer have also cut the prices of a number of Intel parts, too - which is just what the market needed. These cuts include a £46 reduction in price of the the Intel Core i7-7700, and more modest, but still significant, cuts across the Core i5 range that AMD's Ryzen 5 is squarely aimed at. Possibly as early as July, AMD will complete its major Ryzen launches this year with the release of the Ryzen 3 microprocessor series, which is broadly intended to compete at the low end against Intel's budget Core i3 and Pentium parts. µ All prices quoted correct at time of writing Further reading Numb Thumbs Project Scorpio shuns Ryzen in favour of 'evolved' AMD Jaguar CPU 06 Apr 2017 Components AMD Ryzen forces price cuts to legacy FX and A10 CPUs 27 Mar 2017 Hardware What you missed in tech last week: Windows 10 keylogger, AMD 'plotting' 16-core Ryzen CPU 27 Mar 2017 Chips AMD said to be planning 'behemoth' 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen CPU 21 Mar 2017 Chips AMD's Ryzen 5 available on 11 April from $169 16 Mar 2017 Chipset/Mobo AMD's Ryzen 7 is half the price of Intel's Core i7, despite 'better performance' 22 Feb 2017 Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Chips Desktop Laptop cloud computing Ryzen AMD Intel INQ Latest PC sales slump might be over, unless it isn't What is a PC, anyway?

By: FE Online | Published: April 12, 2017 2:23 PM ICC has announced the collaboration with Intel with an aim to drive the use of powerful technologies to redefine the cricket watching experience for fans as well as upgrade the performance of players and coaches. International Cricket Council (ICC) has named tech giant Intel as the Innovation Partner for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy scheduled to begin from June 2017. ICC has announced the collaboration with an aim to drive the use of powerful technologies to redefine the cricket watching experience for fans as well as upgrade the performance of players and coaches. However, not many details of the tie-up have been announced and ICC will release more information on specific innovations to be deployed at the tournament in the near future. Intel, on its part, will likely use technologies like virtual reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in a bid to get innovations to ICC Champions Trophy 2017, and make it a ‘smart cricket tournament’. ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said, “The innovations we’re working with Intel on for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 are like nothing we’ve seen in the sport before and I’m delighted to welcome them to the ICC family.” With the new partnership, it is expected that the game of cricket will become smarter as it always has, with the advent of newer technologies. Apart from an improvement in the viewing and fan experience, it is also expected that the performance of players will improve with increased efficiency. With more intelligent technology incorporated into the game, it is expected that cricket as we know it, will become more transparent too. James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group said, “Cricket is the world’s second most popular sport and as the official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy, we are excited to integrate Intel technology in this tournament.” He added, “We will be deploying a range of technology at the event as part of our ongoing effort to bring a new level of data analytics to sports and to revolutionise how athletes train, coaches teach, scouts evaluate talent and fans enjoy sports.” A Topend Sports report suggested that cricket, with over 2.5 billion fans globally, is currently the 2nd most popular sport. The report cites data from Most Popular Sports, where it says that the game has a regional popularity in Asia, Australia and UK.

While the new chips are extremely powerful, they’re not particularly cheap. Today, AMD released its new Ryzen 5 midrange CPU family, aimed squarely at Intel’s desktop Core i5 and Core i7 SKUs. Can AMD pull a win out of its hat two months in a row? AMD is launching multiple Ryzen 5 processors today, from the Ryzen 5 1400 (quad-core, SMT, 3.2GHz base, 3.4GHz turbo) to the Ryzen 5 1600X (six-core, SMT, 3.6GHz base, 4GHz turbo). We have two of the new parts on-tap today — the Ryzen 5 1500X, with an MSRP of $189, and the Ryzen 5 1600X, with an MSRP of $249. Details on the two chips are shown below. Like Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 is aggressively targeting Intel’s price points and market position. At $189, the 1500X offers SMT, a feature Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips have always lacked. At $249, the 1600X packs six cores and SMT to compete directly the upper end of Intel’s Core i5 range (the 7600 and 7600K) as well as the Core i7-7700K. But the threat to Intel isn’t just about processors. AMD’s new B350 chipset has picked a fight with Intel’s midrange chipset designs as well. The chart above show AMD’s various chipsets for Ryzen; we’ll be testing the midrange B350 today as opposed to the higher-end X370. Intel’s equivalent midrange chipset is the B250. Overclocking: AMD’s B350 fully supports it for both memory and CPUs. Intel’s B250 does not. The highest RAM standard you can use on a B250 board is 2400MHz. This includes any attempt to use XMP settings — our Asrock B250M Performance board died and refused to POST every time we attempted to load XMP values. Why Asrock continues to make them an option on a motherboard that shouldn’t offer the feature is anyone’s guess. RAID support: The B350 supports RAID 0, 1, and 10. Intel’s B250 supports no RAID of any kind. USB support: Intel’s B250 offers more native USB 3.0 ports without the need for any additional chips, but AMD has a pair of native 3.1 Gen 2 ports that Intel lacks. NVMe support: Both Intel and AMD can support NVMe, but there’s a difference between them. AMD’s support for PCI Express 3.0 is baked directly into the SoC on its own dedicated channel, while Intel’s NVMe support shares bandwidth with all of the other chipset I/O, connected via DMI 3.0. Motherboards based on B350 are expected to retail for $75 – $120, which broadly corresponds to Intel’s B250 motherboard ($62 – $129 on Newegg). Overall, we’d say AMD’s B350 offers better enthusiast features, with USB 3.1 Gen 2, RAID 0,1,10 support, and fully unlocked overclocking. Intel’s B250 has the edge in total PCI Express 3.0 lanes, but all of that I/O has to pass through the bottleneck of an x4 PCIe configuration (DMI 3.0). AMD also uses an x4 PCIe connection to provide much of its I/O, but that’s key to the company’s argument: What good is that much connectivity if any serious attempt to use all of it results in I/O bottlenecks? Test setup: I’ve got the DDR4-3200 blues My original plan was to test Ryzen 5 with the same 16GB of DDR4-3200 that we used for the Ryzen 7 launch. This worked beautifully with our Ryzen 5 1600X, but refused to play nice with the 1500X. We tried two different sets of DRAM from Geil and G.Skill, and neither could run at 3200MHz when paired with the 1500X. Adjusting timing and voltages made no difference. We dropped back to DDR4-2933 for the 1500X and ran all those tests before realizing that Intel’s B250 chipset presented its own problem. With no memory overclocking capabilities at all, the fastest RAM we could pair with the Core i5-7500 was DDR4-2400. These configuration discrepancies are noted in our graphs. Since higher DRAM clocks and voltages also increase power consumption, our maximum power consumption tests cannot be considered a strict apples-to-apples comparison. All four testbeds were tested with the same Geil DDR-3200 with an Gigabyte G1 Gaming GTX 1070 running Nvidia driver version 376.33. Our general benchmark results echo what we saw with Ryzen 7. Given room to stretch its legs threads, Ryzen 5 easily outperforms the Core i7-7700K. In tests that don’t thread as well, Ryzen 5 can be outmaneuvered by the 7700K’s higher clocks and IPC edge. In the 12 non-gaming benchmarks and sub-benchmarks we performed, the 1600X beats the Core i7-7700K in seven of them. The i5-7500 and Ryzen 5 1500X show a nearly identical spread between tests. The only difference is that the i5-7500 and the 1500X effectively tied in PCMark 8 (tests within a 2-3% of each other are considered ties). The final count for the 1500X is seven wins to four losses vis-à-vis the i5-7500. Let’s switch over now and consider gaming performance. We’ve retained the game settings and resolutions we tested Ryzen 7 with, but have updated Ashes of the Singularity and switched to its standalone expansion pack, Escalation, to take advantage of recent patches that improved Ryzen’s overall performance. Conclusion: AMD is gunning for Intel’s entire product stack AMD hasn’t pivoted from the Ryzen 7 strategy it debuted five weeks ago: Introduce extremely competitive CPUs at bargain-basement prices. forcing Intel to either cut its own prices or watch its market share shrink. It’ll take some time before we know how well that strategy is working, but the Ryzen 5 1500X and 1600X are both extremely well-positioned. The Ryzen 5 1600X wins a majority of its non-gaming benchmarks against the Core i7-7700K and maintains high frame rates (though not leadership) in comparison to the Intel processor. Given that the Core i7-7700K costs 1.4x more than the Ryzen 5 1600X, it’s hard to justify that CPU based on frame rates alone. The Core i5-7500 is in an even tougher position compared with the Ryzen 5 1500X. Unlike the Core i7-7700K, which outperforms the 1600X in almost every gaming test, the 1500X beat the i5-7500 in Ashes of the Singularity and in one of our Civilization VI tests. In multi-threaded applications, the 1500X is always the better option. Frankly, I’m not as concerned about the “Ryzen gap” in gaming as I was when Ryzen launched. AMD has demonstrated that Ryzen can recover some of the missing performance thanks to updates and patches, and our GTX 1080 Ti review illustrated that the 1800X can go head-to-head with Intel’s Core i7-6900K in 1440p and 4K with barely a hint of daylight between the two CPUs. Ryzen 5’s debut has highlighted how weak the Core i7-7700K’s value proposition truly is. In the old days, when the FX-9590 competed with Core i7 in much the same way a pigeon competes against a bird-of-prey, Intel could get away with charging an extra $100 for Hyper-Threading. If you care about a mix of gaming and multi-threaded performance, the 1600X blows the Core i7-7700K out of the water. If you only care about gaming, the 7700K seems like an easy pick — but remember, repeated testing shows that Hyper-Threading adds almost nothing to overall frame rates over and above a fast Core i5. There’s nothing wrong with the Core i7-7700K, but it’s neither a great deal for gamers (the Core i5-7600K is $100 less and has a 3.8GHz base clock with a 4.2GHz boost), nor for multi-threading performance. Between high-end Core i5’s and Ryzen, the Core i7 doesn’t have much room to stake a position for itself. While Intel wasn’t able to provide any six-core chips for testing, we don’t expect the six-core verdicts to look much different than the eight-core chip comparisons did in early March. Intel’s Core i7-6800K (3.4GHz base, 3.6GHz Turbo) is a $419 CPU; the 6850K (3.6GHz base, 3.8GHz Turbo) costs $609. At $249, the 1600X will go through both like a fat kid on cake. Final verdict? These chips are everything we like about Ryzen, a bit less of things we didn’t like much, and they’re selling at prices that wreck Intel’s price structure. While there are exceptions and corner cases, AMD currently offers the best overall price/performance ratios in the CPU business. It’s about time. If you want to watch Intel’s overall pricing and see if these new launches trigger any price cuts, UpgradeYourTech.com has put together a website where you can watch pricing.         LATEST STORIES (9) Iraqi Popular Forces Provide Medical, Humanitarian Aid to Displaced Families of Western Mosul Syrian Army Seizes Control of Strategic Hills South of Palmyra Syrian Army Engages in Fierce Clashes with Terrorists in Manshiyeh Neighborhood of Daraa Hundreds in Syrian Capital Protest US Strike 92 Buses Arrive in Zabadani, Madaya to Evacuate Militants, Their Families Syria: Thousands Rally outside UN's Damascus Office to Condemn US Missile Strikes Iraqi Forces Advancing in Western Mosul Terrorists Forced to Retreat from Northern Hama Canada: Toronto Protesters Denounce US Bombing of Syria S.

Would you buy this? Yes 26 No 1 Price $ 359.00 (AUD) The $359 hexa-core AMD Ryzen 5 1600X processor is here to challenge Intel’s quad-core, $350 Core i5-7600K for the honour of being “The People’s CPU.” Everyone likes to read about expensive, gold-plated, $1000 parts, but in the real world, most people can’t or won’t spend that much and are looking for the best price-to-performance ratio. While Ryzen 5 1600X may not have clock speeds as high as the Core i5-7600K’s, it does offer additional cores and virtual cores. We’ve run a battery of benchmarks to see if those cores will make up the difference. Gordon Mah Ung AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600X will compete head-on with Intel’s Core 5-7600K in the all-important $350(ish) CPU category. Meet Ryzen 5 AMD actually announced four Ryzen 5 CPUs last month. Two of them are quad-cores with SMT (simultaneous multithreading): The $245 Ryzen 5 1400 and the $275 Ryzen 5 1500X. The last two are six-core chips with SMT: The $319 Ryzen 5 1600 and the $359 Ryzen 5 1600X. [Related: Which CPU is best: Intel or AMD Ryzen?] [Related: Gigabyte Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming 5 AMD Ryzen AM4 motherboard review] All are based on the same die used in the upscale Ryzen 7 lineup we’ve already reviewed, but they have cores switched off. The one of most interest to us is the Ryzen 5 1600X. With its list price of $359, it maps almost perfectly to the Core i5-7600K, which has a current list price of $350 but can be had for nearer $320 if you shop around. The six-core and quad-core Ryzen CPUs are essentially built using the same eight-core dies from Ryzen 7. Each features two Core Complex (CCX) units with CPU cores switched off. One core on each is switched off for the six-core Ryzen 5s, and two cores on each are turned off for the quad-core CPUs. They also have different clock speeds. AMD Each Zen core complex is made up of four individual processors. AMD turns off some cores for the six-core and quad-core Ryzen 5 parts. How we tested For the Core i5-7600K, testing was conducted using the same system we used for the Core i7-7700K in our Ryzen 7 review, but with a few key changes. We updated the Asus ROG Maximus IV Code to the latest available BIOS, which basically adds Optane support. We also pulled two of four memory modules we had installed. This reduced the RAM from 32GB to 16GB of DDR4, but it also allowed us to increase the memory clock of our Corsair modules from DDR4/2133 to DDR4/2933 speeds. Ryzen 5 vs Core i5 Note that running Kaby Lake at higher speeds with all memory slots full isn’t an issue. Not all of the CPUs we tested (*cough* Ryzen), however, will easily support high clock speeds with all DIMM slots loaded. For the Ryzen 5 1600X, rather than re-use the previous AMD X370 build from the Ryzen 7 review, I used an MSI B350 Tomahawk motherboard. AMD provided the board, saying it had a newer BIOS that offered the best performance. A clean install of Windows 10 was loaded onto a Kingston 256GB HyperX SSD (the same model and capacity used in other test machines). For RAM, I used a pair of Geil EVO 8GB modules with the timing set to AMD’s specifications for testing on the Tomahawk board. As with all of our builds, we used Founders Edition GeForce GTX 1080 cards. I verified clock and RAM timings on each card before I began testing.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel’s X299 HEDT Platform with LGA 2066 Socket Codenamed ‘Basin Falls’ – Launch Pushed Forward to Computex 2017 in June By Usman Pirzada Apr 9, 2017 196Shares Share Tweet Submit Overview of Intel's X299 HEDT platform codenamed Basin Falls. It looks like Intel’s upcoming X299 platform will be codenamed Basin Falls and will be launching sometime in June. The leak stems from Benchlife.info, a very reliable source we have been using for almost a decade. Not only has the code-name been leaked, but in typical benchlife style, they have also given a lot of details regarding the platform as well. Intel’s upcoming X299 HEDT platform codenamed ‘Basin Falls’  detailed, launching in June at Computex 2017 The previous date for the release of HEDT X299 platform was rumored to be around Gamescom sometimes in August, but Benchlife claims this is going to happen by Computex this year – and they have a very good reason for doing so as we will soon see. The event is going to be held from May 31 to June 3, and it looks like Intel is planning on launching the brand new Basin Falls X299 platform at that time. Related Rumor: Intel Could Commercialize A 12 Core/ 24 Thread Skylake-X CPU To Fight Ryzen – Reports Italian Publication Production schedule of Kaby Lake X and Sky Lake X. Skylake-X processor production is slated for the 25th week of the year, or late June (19th – 25th). Kabylake-X processor production is slated for the same time span as Skylake-X. Qualification of the samples will take place between May 29th– June 4th.  Since this is pretty much the same time frame as Computex, we can see why Benchlife is claiming an unveiling event at Computex. We should also expect to see a showcase of motherboards from various manufacturers. Advertisement The HEDT launch lineup will include at least four SKUs that will make their way to the X299 platform. All processors will utilize the 14nm process node, however, the Kaby Lake-X chips may have a slight edge due to the process optimizations. This would result in better clock speeds with reduced power consumption, adding to the efficiency. The four SKUs will include a 10 core, 8 core, 6 core and 4 core model. The 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on Skylake architecture. The 4 core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture which launched on mainstream platforms earlier this month. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W while the Kaby Lake-X chip will feature a TDP of 112W. All chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors utilize the LGA 2066 socket. The LGA 2066 socket of the HEDT Basin Falls platform is called Socket R4. SKL-X will have up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 68 lanes) while as Kaby Lake-X will have only up to 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 40 lanes). Skylake-X will have qud channel DDR 4 memory up to 2667 in 1DPC mode and up to 2400 in 2DPC mode. Kabylake-X on the other hand will only have dual channel DDR4. The Kaby Lake PCH will have 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 8 Sata Gen3, 10 USB 3.0 pots and connected via 4 DMI 3.0 lanes to the processor. Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) will also be present on the chipset.

Since Windows ME (which, I’ve been reliably informed, doesn’t stand for ‘Mistake Edition’)? Ever? From this point onwards, those still using Vista are on their own. Microsoft will no longer issue bug fixes and security updates. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT Those who continue to use Vista essentially put themselves at risk. For most people, this isn’t an issue. Scarce few people still use it. According to NetMarketShare, its user-base totaled 0.72 percent of operating systems in March. It’s interesting to note that the response to Vista’s discontinuation is subdued – especially when compared to Windows XP, which even today continues to command a sizable market share. Nobody really cares. There’s scarce moaning, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. But that’s because Vista was shit. Actually, honest-to-god awful, and the team who worked on it should be made to sit in a corner to think about what they’ve done, like naughty schoolchildren. I suppose our little retrospective should start at its launch. Initially, Microsoft made confident claims about how most computers on the market would be able to handle Vista, and how consumers would be able to use their old hardware. There would be no need to buy a new computer, or fork out for upgrades. Yeah, that was a lie. At launch, Vista’s hardware support was spotty, with the operating system lacking support for major and mainstream hardware components. At the time, The Register’s Thomas C Greene wrote an entertaining post about how Vista couldn’t support even the most vanilla of internals. … imagine my surprise when the [Vista Update] Advisor reported that several devices might not be compatible with Vista. And just look at how mainstream these “questionable” items are: nVidia GeForce 7900; Creative X-Fi Audio Processor; Intel 82566DC Gigabit Network Connection; Intel ICH8 Family USB Universal Host Controller; Intel ICH8 Family USB2 Enhanced Host Controller. Others were less stoic about the situation. A visit to YouTube shows the strength of feeling from those who actually forked out for it, only for it to fail to install. Worse, some laptops shipped with Vista Capable stickers, and marketed as such, when they actually weren’t. This lead to a lengthy legal battle between Microsoft and several pissed off consumers, which Microsoft eventually won after the judge stripped the claim of its class action status. Those that eventually got the OS working quickly found that it ran like a dog – a bloated, wheezy, snoring, asthmatic dog. With three legs. And arthritis. And a 40-a-day smoking habit. You get the idea. Yes, folks. Vista was slow. It ran tasks measurably slower than Windows XP, with those who opted to activate Aero and its other visual bells-and-whistles facing the brunt of its performance issues. Sure, you could turn them off, leaving you with a more austere Windows XP-like experience. But given the major selling point of Vista was the fact that it was a novel and visually pleasing take on the Windows experience, this kinda defeated the point. As a partial defense of Vista, Microsoft did try things here that remain in later versions of Windows. Vista pioneered UAC (User Account Control), which remains a cornerstone of Microsoft’s strategy for Windows security. But it did so in a way that was so ill-conceived and ham-fisted, that it pissed off a lot of people. In fact, UAC on Vista sucked so much, people started to routinely disable it, which ironically made them more insecure. The biggest kick in the teeth was that Vista was really expensive. A fresh install of Vista Ultimate Edition would set you back $399, while the cheapest version, Vista Basic, retailed for $199. Essentially, people paid huge sums of money for an operating system that was slower, and was arguably worse, than its predecessor. And that’s just skimming the surface. Although it feels ages ago now, at the time, Vista was a deeply unpopular product, with a seemingly countless number of flaws. Thankfully, Microsoft has moved on. Windows 7 showed that the company was responsive to feedback, and improved on the errors of its predecessor. Windows 8 was a bit of a mixed bag, although it it was nice to see the company take seriously the increasing pivot to touch-based interfaces. And then there’s Windows 10, which is a very solid operating system indeed. It could be argued that it represents Microsoft’s finest hour, and hows that the company can be ambitious, while also caring deeply about the end-user experience. Given this impressive progress, I don’t think anyone will really miss Vista.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Security Researcher Trammell Hudson and Device Maker Purism Join Forces to Set a New Standard for Security-Focused Laptops /EINPresswire.com/ — SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwired – April 12, 2017) – One of the foremost security researchers in the infosec community, Trammell Hudson, is working with secure device maker Purism to integrate his free and open-source „Heads” firmware into the company’s Librem laptop line. Purism will be the first hardware company to integrate Heads into its products, and the partnership will push the industry standard with unprecedented protection for end-user devices. Testing has already begun for the integration of the two platforms. When integrated into Purism Librem hardware, Heads will provide cryptographic verification of the system’s firmware and operating system — using CPU features like Bootguard, flash protection and a TPM — to provide a strong hardware „root of trust” while also allowing more advanced users to modify their own systems and securely install their own custom firmware. Purism coreboot-enabled hardware is already immune to widespread attacks against EFI/UEFI firmware (threats that have been documented in the „Vault 7” CIA documents leak); adding Heads enables cryptographically signing the lowest levels, allowing users to protect their devices against third-party modification. Conventional security approaches such as antivirus and malware detection programs are no longer enough to keep out attackers and criminals in today’s online world. Purism’s vision in working with Hudson to integrate Heads is to increase the safety of individuals and organizations through this technological advancement. The imperative for computer makers to implement better stewardship models to increase individuals’ protection is evident, as 2017 has been a hallmark year for privacy and security concerns and individuals’ protection rollbacks: This demonstrates a clear need for both increased education about these topics, and devices that put users first and empower use of security measures to give them peace of mind about engaging online. „Purism’s Librem laptops are ideally suited for the philosophy of the Heads firmware project — Purism is manufacturing modern hardware designed to allow the users to have control of their own systems,” said Trammell hudson, well-known information security researcher and founder of the Heads project. „They are the only vendor that allows users to establish their own hardware root of trust with CPU features like Bootguard, and their support for coreboot and Heads improves security by being open, auditable, flexible and measured.” „We are ecstatic about the partnership between Purism and Heads, especially being able to work closely with Trammell who has proven himself an unadulterated security expert. We have begun co-developing a solution to advance our goals of privacy and security for everyone. This union represents the ideal approach to protecting users by default, without sacrificing convenience or usability,” said Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism. „Including Heads is a natural fit with both the functionality and ideology of the Purism Librem laptops.” About the Purism Librem Purism’s goal with the Librem laptop is to offer a high-end computer with a simple, out-of-the-box, secure computing environment usable by ordinary users with ease. Librem laptops feature customized components designed to increase security and freedom for end-users, including coreboot, a neutralized Intel Management Engine, an Intel CPU shipped unfused in „manufacturing mode” and without vPro, Intel AMT avoidance, and many other features that make this partnership possible on a technical level. About Heads Heads is a free and open-source custom firmware and OS configuration, intended to provide physical security and protection for data on laptops and servers. Heads is the result of several years of firmware vulnerability research and collaboration in the infosec community. Combining physical hardening of specific hardware platforms and flash security features, Heads allows moving the „root of trust” into the write-protected ROM and preventing further modifications to the bootup code. As it controls the first instruction the CPU executes, Heads can measure every step of the boot process using a Trusted Platform Module, making it possible to attest to the user that the firmware has not been tampered with. Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM can be used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the main storage drives. Additionally, Heads allows the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images to be signed by keys controlled by the user, in addition to the ability of the operating system to use a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits attempting to gain persistence will be detected. About Trammell Hudson Trammell has been researching hardware and firmware security topics for many years, such as the „Thunderstrike” (and „Thunderstrike 2„) firmware rootkits on Apple Macbooks, as well as techniques for reducing the functionality of the Intel Management Engine. He also started the „Magic Lantern” project, an open runtime for the Canon DSLR cameras that allows users to take control of their own devices. About Purism Purism is a Social Purpose Corporation devoted to bringing security, privacy, software freedom, and digital independence to everyone’s personal computing experience. With operations based in San Francisco (California) and around the world, Purism manufactures premium-quality laptops and tablets, creating beautiful and powerful devices meant to protect users’ digital lives without requiring a compromise on ease of use. Purism designs and assembles its hardware in the United States, carefully selecting internationally sourced components to be privacy-respecting and fully Free-Software-compliant.

Ryzen is becoming wildly popular and as such we believe that SSD benchmarks on AMD's newest platform are a must.   We are excited by Plextor's first NVMe SSD, the M8Pe, because it is the first SSD to come across our bench that is based on Marvell's 88SS1093 Gen3 x4 NVMe controller. Marvell controllers are always exquisite pieces of engineering and we expect the 88SS1093 is no exception. Marvell controllers are supplied without firmware so buyers can customize the performance of the controller as they see fit. This means you won't be seeing Marvell controlled SSD's coming from smaller companies that do not have in-house firmware engineers.   Marvell's 88SS1093 NVMe SSD controller:     The M8PeY pairs Marvell's 88SS1093 8-channel "Eldora" controller with premium Toshiba 15mn MLC planar flash, a massive solid aluminum heat sink and Plextor's own custom firmware. The looks of the drive are as impressive as its heft (1/2 pound). In addition, for those of you that love flashy LED lighting, the M8PeY is just what you are looking for because it has plenty of it.     Plextor is marketing the M8PeY as a superior gaming SSD due to its flashy looks, superior cooling characteristics and sequential read/write performance. Plextor prides themselves on superior quality and backs it up with an industry best 2.4 million hour MTBF rating. Features include Plextor's exclusive TrueSpeed and TrueProtect technologies. TrueSpeed technology keeps long-term SSD performance at like-new speeds after periods of use and when the SSD is nearly full. TrueProtect technology is a multi-layered error checking mechanism automatically executed by the firmware. TrueProtect keeps data access error-free. Additionally, data accuracy is insured by Marvell's latest third generation LDPC bit correction which also provides extended endurance for the flash array.   There are three variants in the M8Pe Series. All three are based on the same M.2 x 2280 SSD module. The M8PeGN is a bare M.2 SSD. The M8PeG is an M.2 module with a small heat spreader and the model we have on the bench today, the M8PeY. The M8PeY has the M.2 SSD mounted on an HHHL AIC along with that massive solid aluminum heat sink we mentioned earlier.     Specifications     The Plextor M8Pe series NVMe SSD is available in four capacities: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. The 256GB M8PeY we have on the bench today sports the following specifications:   Sequential Read: up to 2,000 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 900 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: up to 210,000 IOPS @ QD32 Max 4K Random Write Speed: up to 230,000 IOPS @ QD32 Endurance: up to 384 TBW MTBF: 2.4 Million Hours Warranty: 5-Year Limited Warranty SMART TRIM Garbage Collection   The 256GB M8PeY is currently selling at Amazon and Newegg for: $169.99 Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find the product discussed for sale below.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Security Researcher Trammell Hudson and Device Maker Purism Join Forces to Set a New Standard for Security-Focused Laptops Hudson’s security firmware Heads will be built into Purism Librem hardware to further protect users from cybersecurity threats, privacy invasion, identity theft, and more SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwired – April 12, 2017) – One of the foremost security researchers in the infosec community, Trammell Hudson, is working with secure device maker Purism to integrate his free and open-source „Heads” firmware into the company’s Librem laptop line. Purism will be the first hardware company to integrate Heads into its products, and the partnership will push the industry standard with unprecedented protection for end-user devices. Testing has already begun for the integration of the two platforms. When integrated into Purism Librem hardware, Heads will provide cryptographic verification of the system’s firmware and operating system — using CPU features like Bootguard, flash protection and a TPM — to provide a strong hardware „root of trust” while also allowing more advanced users to modify their own systems and securely install their own custom firmware. Purism coreboot-enabled hardware is already immune to widespread attacks against EFI/UEFI firmware (threats that have been documented in the „Vault 7” CIA documents leak); adding Heads enables cryptographically signing the lowest levels, allowing users to protect their devices against third-party modification. Conventional security approaches such as antivirus and malware detection programs are no longer enough to keep out attackers and criminals in today’s online world. Purism’s vision in working with Hudson to integrate Heads is to increase the safety of individuals and organizations through this technological advancement. The imperative for computer makers to implement better stewardship models to increase individuals’ protection is evident, as 2017 has been a hallmark year for privacy and security concerns and individuals’ protection rollbacks: This demonstrates a clear need for both increased education about these topics, and devices that put users first and empower use of security measures to give them peace of mind about engaging online. „Purism’s Librem laptops are ideally suited for the philosophy of the Heads firmware project — Purism is manufacturing modern hardware designed to allow the users to have control of their own systems,” said Trammell hudson, well-known information security researcher and founder of the Heads project. „They are the only vendor that allows users to establish their own hardware root of trust with CPU features like Bootguard, and their support for coreboot and Heads improves security by being open, auditable, flexible and measured.” „We are ecstatic about the partnership between Purism and Heads, especially being able to work closely with Trammell who has proven himself an unadulterated security expert. We have begun co-developing a solution to advance our goals of privacy and security for everyone. This union represents the ideal approach to protecting users by default, without sacrificing convenience or usability,” said Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism. „Including Heads is a natural fit with both the functionality and ideology of the Purism Librem laptops.” About the Purism Librem Purism’s goal with the Librem laptop is to offer a high-end computer with a simple, out-of-the-box, secure computing environment usable by ordinary users with ease. Librem laptops feature customized components designed to increase security and freedom for end-users, including coreboot, a neutralized Intel Management Engine, an Intel CPU shipped unfused in „manufacturing mode” and without vPro, Intel AMT avoidance, and many other features that make this partnership possible on a technical level. About Heads Heads is a free and open-source custom firmware and OS configuration, intended to provide physical security and protection for data on laptops and servers. Heads is the result of several years of firmware vulnerability research and collaboration in the infosec community. Combining physical hardening of specific hardware platforms and flash security features, Heads allows moving the „root of trust” into the write-protected ROM and preventing further modifications to the bootup code. As it controls the first instruction the CPU executes, Heads can measure every step of the boot process using a Trusted Platform Module, making it possible to attest to the user that the firmware has not been tampered with. Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM can be used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the main storage drives. Additionally, Heads allows the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images to be signed by keys controlled by the user, in addition to the ability of the operating system to use a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits attempting to gain persistence will be detected. About Trammell Hudson Trammell has been researching hardware and firmware security topics for many years, such as the „Thunderstrike” (and „Thunderstrike 2„) firmware rootkits on Apple Macbooks, as well as techniques for reducing the functionality of the Intel Management Engine. He also started the „Magic Lantern” project, an open runtime for the Canon DSLR cameras that allows users to take control of their own devices. About Purism Purism is a Social Purpose Corporation devoted to bringing security, privacy, software freedom, and digital independence to everyone’s personal computing experience. With operations based in San Francisco (California) and around the world, Purism manufactures premium-quality laptops and tablets, creating beautiful and powerful devices meant to protect users’ digital lives without requiring a compromise on ease of use. Purism designs and assembles its hardware in the United States, carefully selecting internationally sourced components to be privacy-respecting and fully Free-Software-compliant. Security and privacy-centric features come built-in with every product Purism makes, making security and privacy the simpler, logical choice for individuals and businesses.

The Summit emphasised the criticality of creating a unified global standard, backed by a strong unified ecosystem. Industry organisations ITU, 3GPP, NGMN, GTI and GSMA attended the event and were joined by executives from AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo and Vodafone. In addition, the vendor community was represented by Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. Speakers from each of the participants detailed the current state of play in 5G roll-out and set out their expected timeframe for increased testing of the technologies as they mature towards early commercial launches in 2020… The 5G Test Summit, held at Mobile World Congress 2017, brought together industry organisations, mobile network operators and vendors of 5G technologies to issue a joint declaration on the future direction of 5G trials and testing. The Summit emphasised the criticality of creating a unified global standard, backed by a strong unified ecosystem. Industry organisations ITU, 3GPP, NGMN, GTI and GSMA attended the event and were joined by executives from AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo and Vodafone. In addition, the vendor community was represented by Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. Speakers from each of the participants detailed the current state of play in 5G roll-out and set out their expected timeframe for increased testing of the technologies as they mature towards early commercial launches in 2020. “We’re all working for achieving an ecosystem which is unified through the adoption of unified 5G standards,” François Rancy, the director of the ITU’s Radiocommunications Bureau, told the Summit, adding: “We’re about halfway through the effort of creating the unified standards and ecosystem.” That effort is complex and involves many different organisations working closely together to turn 5G into reality. “5G reshapes society,” said Wang Xiaoyun, the vice chair of the IMT-2020 (5G) promotion group and general manager of the department of technology at China Mobile. “The low latency, communications density, energy efficiency and peak data rate [that 5G offers] are very important for operators and people. 4G was to build a road by 5G is to build a city, to create a cross-industry ecosystem.” Wang added that she saw the role of the 5G Test Summit as being to advocate a 5G unified standard and ecosystem that enables smooth global roaming as well as global scale to reduce cost. China Mobile itself is setting up what it claims will be the world’s largest 5G trial network in Huairou, Beijing, with six vendors involved. The operator will have more than 100 sites participating in 5G trials in 2019, she said. Other operators are also advancing well in their early test efforts. “We see 5G as an evolution, not a single event,” Gordon Mansfield, the vice president of RAN and device design at AT&T, told the Summit. “5G addresses massive communications throughput and capacity and critical IoT applications with ultra-low latency. AT&T wants to take DirecTV and put it on mobile and offer 4k video, augmented reality applications. We see 5G standards as being the proving ground and a unified standard helps us get to a unified ecosystem. We already have some friendly customer trials underway and want to expand into pilot projects that will allow us to have early products.” Takehiro Nakamura, the vice president and general director of the 5G Laboratory at NTT Docomo, has also started trials. “Commercial deployment is set for 2020 initially in areas where high performance is required,” he said. “It’s very difficult to deploy [5G] nationwide from the beginning. From this year, we will trial more and more and at larger scale and over a larger area.” The timeframe although measured in years is demanding and operators have some concerns about accelerating standardisation. “Unless we make decisions towards the end of the year, we’ll lose time in having the commercial chipsets available to meet our needs,” Luke Ibbetson, the director of Vodafone Group R&D, warned the Summit. “Never underestimate the benefits of having global scale behind the technology. As we got towards 5G we need to resist any attempts to fragment the ecosystem which will only cost us money and slow us down.” Another speaker at the Summit, Arnaud Vamparys, the senior vice president of radio networks at Orange, who has been working on NGMN’s 5G Trial and Testing Initiative, discussed how the organisation is working on developing building blocks for operators to use for the construction of their 5G networks. “The testing strategy is being defined and test cases will follow,” he said. “Interoperability testing will be triggered by a 5G work item in [3GPP] Release 15 which will start at the end of this year.” Industry organisations and mobile operators were not alone in acknowledging the complexity involved in the 5G test, standardisation and roll-out process. “5G will be the enabler of the fourth Industrial Revolution but it needs a global unified standard, new services and new markets, technological innovation and a mature industrial chain to succeed,” said Yang Chaobin, the president of the 5G product line at Huawei. “The test pattern in 5G will be different to that of 2G, 3G and 4G so it must be unified to ensure the user experience is good. The test pattern must take account of pooled hardware resources, fully distributed architecture and full automation.” “5G needs cross industry, end-to-end integration testing that brings multiple industries, cloud RAN and applications together,” Yang added. “In 2017, 5G testing will open a super-connected era.” Towards the end of the Summit, representatives from the companies participating in the 5G Test Summit came together onto the stage to initiate the Global 5G Test Trial Declaration, a joint statement of intent for the trial and testing of 5G technologies. AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo, Vodafone, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Keysight, MediaTek, Nokia, Qualcomm, Rohde & Schwarz, ZTE and Datang jointly declared the statement promoting unified, global 5G standards achieved through 5G testing, trials and cooperation between telecom operators, vendors and vertical industry partners to build a unified end-to-end (E2E) ecosystem.

Intel Developers Looking To Get Nios II Backend In LLVM Written by Michael Larabel in Compiler on 12 April 2017 at 06:55 AM EDT. 3 Comments Intel's compiler team is working on getting an Altera Nios II back-end mainlined within LLVM. Nios II is a 32-bit general-purpose RISC processor part of the Altera family of FPGAs. Intel acquired Altera back in 2015 for those that forgot or didn't get the memo. The 32-bit Nios II is the successor to the original (16-bit) Nios. Nios II is licensed through Synopsys Designware for those wanting the architecture on ASICs. Intel developers are now proposing a Nios II back-end for both the architecture's R1 and R2 ISAs. GCC already has supported Nios II while Intel developers have been getting the LLVM support going. Those interested in embedded systems or Nios II specifically can learn more details about Intel's proposed LLVM back-end plans via this LLVM-dev message. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News 4 challenges of modern-day PR One of the biggest challenges facing PR pros used to be faxing a press release to 100 reporters—one at a time. (Yes, some of us remember those days.) Today, everyone is online 24/7, creating a completely different environment for those of us who communicate for a living. While the internet has made many facets of our jobs so much easier-like getting those press releases out—it’s also created an entirely new set of challenges. Let’s take a look at how the digital world has changed some of our challenges as PR pros: 1. Managing crises in less time Gone are the days when you had the time to prepare a statement in the event of a crisis. John Thompson, founder and principal of Critical Communications and assistant professor at Southwestern University just north of Austin, has worked with some of the biggest tech organizations in the world, including Intel, Dell and Motorola. He was at ground zero in one of the first internet-driven scandals, the Pentium processor crisis at Intel in the 1990s. „In those days, we had hours we could work with in getting back to the media. Today, time is compressed to minutes, and that puts a premium on both truthfulness and reasoning that isn’t necessarily understood,” Thompson says. A crisis communications plan is imperative to have prepared in advance. It takes forethought to have a framework in place for communicating in any crisis, be it fake news, an accident or a social media misstep. Brands often don’t get a second chance to make it right. With social media, judgment by consumers can be swift—and at times, harsh. [RELATED: Attend the Practical PR Summit and transform your PR skills to become more successful in the new media landscape.] Cameron Craig, head of global corporate communications at Polycom, who spent ten years on Apple’s PR team and is also a speaker and consultant, cites Zappos as an example of how to handle bad news well. When Zappos announced extensive layoffs, it did something unique. The organization put all its internal messaging on its external site. „While layoffs are never good news, the way they handled it strengthened their brand over time,” says Craig. „People appreciated their transparency.” 2. Keeping news ‚under wraps’ Craig also points out that in the internet age, it’s tougher to keep secrets-if you can keep them at all. In his days at Apple, Craig says, the organization would plan big launch events to unveil new technology. In most instances the team was able to keep the news a secret until the big unveil. „Today, when you have products that take a long time to develop, it’s much harder to keep them under wraps,” Craig explains. In these cases, he suggests that it may be better to „embrace the leak.” Yes, some brands will release information internally, expecting that it will leak. An example Craig cites occurred when Tim Cook of Apple recently shared some news first on the employee intranet. It was then leaked, ending up on TechCrunch and other online publications—but the information was written in a way that seemed as if Apple understood there’d be a leak. Craig suggests this may be a wiser way to approach situations such as these. „If you understand that the wall between internal and external communications is coming down, you can communicate differently,” he says. 3. Enforcing ethics When it comes to ethical dilemmas, how have times changed? Not as much as one might think. „PR people have always dealt with issues of defending controversial positions, or finding a way of delivering a position they disagree with after losing an internal battle,” Thompson says. Craig adds, „While it’s changed in some ways, it’s still kind of the same. On any given day, reporters are coming to companies asking us for our opinion on politics, scandals and so on. We’ve always had to look at each case and consider the ramifications for our brand.” „Those issues still exist, but they now take place in a world that is described as ‚post-truth’ or ‚post-fact’ where the social underpinnings of reality appear to be open to debate,” Thompson continued. „That isn’t a PR person’s dream—it’s a nightmare.” Thompson believes that PR pros have to step up to enforce ethics more than ever before. „Given their unique position in understanding the implications of corporate initiatives and possessing the communication skills that corporations need to win in a fast-changing marketplace where driving transitions are everything, PR pros have an opportunity here.” 4. Connecting self-publishing to corporate strategy While the Internet may have created new challenges for the modern-day PR pro, it’s also created its share of advantages. Self-publishing is one both Craig and Thompson cited. „It’s easier than ever to self-publish through platforms like LinkedIn, Medium and the Huffington Post,” says Craig. „By using them properly, you can reach a pre-existing audience, rather than build one from scratch.” Thompson says a lot of enterprises are still working to connect the ability to self-publish with their corporate strategy. „There’s a tendency among many to devolve the strategy to counting clicks rather than building a position in the marketplace,” he cautions. „If you post pictures of the latest Marvel superheroes, you will likely get clicks. You will not get a position in the marketplace.” And so, the role of the PR practitioner is evolving. „Today’s PR pro is responsible for striking the right journalistic tone in the content produced by a firm so that someone truly wants to read a blog or contributed article in an executive’s name and will find something compelling about it beyond a product pitch,” Thompson says. Sure, the evolution of technology creates new dilemmas—but it also helps us move in valuable new directions.

Trump had reminded his predecessor Barack Obama over the latter’s policy of unilateral military strikes. But then, Washington DC itself has been in a state of civil war since Trump’s victory in the November presidential elections and truce is only possible the American way – by reconciling to Washington's long-term policy of promoting global radical Islamic terrorism which Trump ironically vowed to eradicate in his inauguration speech. Make America War Again Trump has somersaulted a full 180 degrees to capitulate to America’s Wahhabi lobby, led by the likes John McCain, Lyndsey Graham and Hillary Clinton. Any deviation from this norm was considered a Russian plot. However, when those Tomahawks were launched on April 6, Washington had magically found a president for all Americans; one who was no longer a budding dictator, a new Hitler or a Putin shill! Gone too would be Trump’s vows to eradicate the global human trafficking and a child sex slavery ring that is widely suspected of implicating a good number of US Congressmen, Senators and elements of the US military. © AFP 2017/ HO/SANA Bashar's Brilliant 'Response' to US Ambassador Haley's 'Assad Must Go' RantBut what if Trump discovers that the intelligence leading up to the strike was doctored by the same elements who were warring against him? It would be a golden opportunity to drain the swamp, beginning with the US envoy to the UN, Nimrata K. Randhawa aka “Nikki Haley.” Haley is someone who would have never passed the basic civil service exams in her parent’s native India let alone become the leading envoy of a global superpower. Haley is familiar with doctoring facts. She had registered herself as a “white” in her voter registration card in 2001, reflecting an incurable inferiority complex that will surely be counterpoised by tough girl antics at the UN. Harbinger of Global Christian Persecution? © Sputnik/ Iliya Pitalev Is There a US-Russia Grand Bargain in Syria?The great propagandist Edward Barnays would have definitely appreciated the subliminal golden crescent on Haley’s necklace pendant when she pontificated over the deaths of Syrian children at the recent UN Security Council meeting. One wonders if Haley would also condemn an anticipated rise in Islamist attacks against Christians worldwide after Trump’s recent capitulation to the House of Saud – following a pattern set by Ronald Reagan’s appeasement of “freedom fighters” such as Osama bin Laden from the 80s onwards. No US president has ever dared set a red line over the continual persecution of Christians by America’s radical Islamist allies. It was Syria that clearly revealed the Janus-faced reality of American Christianity – a cultic hodgepodge that worships national myths and militarism foremost. While non-Christians may marvel at the stoic bravery of Arab Christian children who refused forced conversions to Islam at the point of death, these are not Trump’s “beautiful babies” but rather an irritant to US foreign policy in the Middle East. The United States, upon closer inspection, is the greatest enabler of Christian persecution worldwide, on top of being the modern font of mainstream cults with Christian pretensions. If the sole global superpower was not founded “of the devil, by the devil, for the devil,” then why are attacks against Christians surging in US-allied states? © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy Encircled by Terrorists: Stories of Russians Residing in Syrian Hama's 'Sacred Town'One need not wait long for a post-Tomahawk surge in jihadi attacks on Christians. On April 9 Sunday morning, an explosion ripped through the Mar Girgis Coptic Church in Tanta, Egypt, killing dozens of parishioners who turned out to celebrate Palm Sunday. The final death tally may only be known in a week. While Christian bishops in Syria and abroad protested Donald Trump’s act of Islamist appeasement, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan celebrated the act and called for more such attacks. Trump also dutifully phoned the Saudi King who commended the most powerful suit on earth for his “courageous decision” to attack the primary Syrian airbase that was protecting the Christian town of Mhardeh from being overrun by head-chopping savages. America’s “moderate rebels” have no qualms about selling Christian women and children in Daesh slave markets. Besides, there is no such thing as beautiful Christian babies in Uncle Samael’s foreign policy. Make America Samael Again Trump’s anti-Damascene experience will surely find mainstream fake news support, unless this was a one-off event designed to expose the hypocrisy of his formerly belligerent domestic opponents. © AP Photo/ Ford Williams/U.S. Navy Poodle Trump Runs With Dogs of WarWhatever the outcome, the average global citizen will now view Trump as a loser who lost a war of internal subversion waged by his own intelligence agencies, and who tolerated daily insubordination by his own handpicked team. If he can be overwhelmed by Hillary Clinton’s mindless recriminations; what more the complex affairs of state? With each passing day, the US government functions more like a mismanaged brothel, with the attendant sleaze, lack of policy direction and foresight. Trump manifestly lacks the stamina to drain the swamp even before reaching his 100th day in office, and is proving to be an unreliable flip-flop who can change his stance within 24 hours. And not just on Syria! Nothing he says or affixes his signature to will be regarded as inviolable. Trump is an “all talk no action” president whose sole KPI henceforth would be the continuation of endless wars waged on behalf of radical Islamic interests under manufactured pretexts. A duet with Rosie O'Donnell may help fill up time when he is not executing that sacred American duty! © AFP 2017/ Thaer Mohammed Aleppo Twitter Girl Bana Is the 'Ultimate Propaganda Stunt' - Syrian ActivistMore disturbingly, Trump seems to have resumed past presidential policies of using children as war props, such as the seven-year-old Syrian girl who had earlier accused him of being anti-Muslim. Flip-flops of a kind flock together. If Bana Alabed is genuine, she would request Trump to accept more Syrian refugees into the United States. Trump should concede, and not just with one token celebrity child. Syria is not a Trump casino where one lucky winner gets the green card jackpot. Trump’s die-hard supporters who have backed the president’s actions in Syria should likewise change their immigration stance. The wall along the border with Mexico can wait but the plight of Bana Alabed and her ilk who look nothing like the emaciated dying frames of Yemeni children should not be ignored. It is clear that you are only a good Muslim in Greater Eurabia if you support the ouster of President Bashar Assad in favour of Daesh, Al Qaeda and its affiliates as well as the continued Saudi-facilitated genocide in Yemen in which children are the prime victims. But there are no “beautiful babies” in Yemen for Trump!   Mathew Maavak is a writer and geopolitical observer residing in Malaysia.

There has been an increase in the demand for mobility in electronic devices worldwide. To be portable and cost-effective, devices need to be lightweight and small. Thus, the increased demand for mobility has translated into a trend toward the adoption of smaller devices. The popularity of smaller devices in multiple sectors such as telecommunications and automotive has, in turn, led to the miniaturization of semiconductor ICs. With the advances in technology, such as 3D ICs and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as the changes in the designs of ICs such as finer patterning, electronic devices are becoming more compact and user-friendly. However, smaller and densely-built semiconductors, ICs, and PCBs have more chances of tribocharging, and thus require anti-static packaging.

In the case of a global economic meltdown, the sales of electronic products are impacted adversely because these products are capital intensive. The ripple effect is felt in the semiconductor equipment market as semiconductors comprise major components in electronic products. As semiconductor sales go down, the sales of semiconductor packaging materials also go down. The global recession of 2009, for example, was one of the most harrowing periods for companies across the semiconductor value chain because of the global economic meltdown. At present, the slow growth of China is a concern for the global electronics market. China’s growth rate fell from 9.6% in 2011 to 6.9% in 2015. It has reduced further during the first three quarters of 2016 to around 6.7%. China consumes and produces more than 50% of the raw materials, such as semiconductors.

Making good on its promise last month, AMD is finally making its more affordable Ryzen 5 processors available for purchase for desktop owners. Built on the same Zen architecture that AMD has been singing about since December last year, the Ryzen 5 line offers a more affordable alternative to the monstrous Ryzen 7 flagships, but with the matching “more efficient” power management. If you’re a PC gamer on a budget, you won’t have to go broke trying to buy a usually more expensive Intel processor. Or at least that’s AMD’s usual spiel. In fact, you won’t even have shell out for AMD’s most expensive chips either. Gamers and even live broadcasters can also make do with the cheaper Ryzen 5 processors who are promised to perform only a little less compared to the higher Ryzen 7. AMD compares its highest Ryzen 5 1600X to the Intel Core i5 7600K, which should explain the numbers. Both are the top of the line “mid-range” processors for their respective generations. Although the Core i5-7600K is probably now cheaper, AMD’s equivalent boasts of 6 cores and 12 threads, whereas Intel’s only has 4 cores and 4 threads. This is significant because, for AMD, this is a multi-threading numbers game. Indeed, benchmarks of AMD’s Ryzen processors show impressing multi-core processing numbers. That said, the Ryzen did seem to be a bit poor in single-core performance. That, however, is a bit inconsequential for AMD. It is targeting Ryzen for gamers, broadcasters, and content creators. In other words, those who benefit the most from multi-threaded processing power. The AMD Ryzen 5 line for desktops currently has four processors, each appealing to certain budget constraints. For just $169, you can already get a Ryzen 5 1400, which offers 4 cores and 8 threads, clocked at 3.2 GHz. If you want to go all out without venturing into Ryzen 7 territory, the 1600X will give you 6 cores, 12 threads, and a much higher 95 W TDP, all for $249.

The company is famously touchy about such things – witness last year's spat with Intel over benchmarks it didn't regard as fair. Well, it's happened again, this time with Nvidia taking exception to Google's claims last week to have overtaken everybody else in the field with its Tensor Processing Units. Had it been competitor Intel, El Reg suspects the return-of-serve would have been made less gently, but The Chocolate Factory is a heavy-hitting Nvidia customer. So before taking issue with Google's claims, Nvidia's blog post starts with a liberal spreading of honey. After acknowledging Mountain View's “groundbreaking work in deep learning” and patting its own back, Nvidia finally gets to the point: Google's benchmark showed the TPU outperformed its Kepler 80 by thirteen times, “however, it doesn’t compare the TPU to the current generation Pascal-based P40”. Nvidia's benchmark “The P40 balances computational precision and throughput, on-chip memory and memory bandwidth to achieve unprecedented performance for training, as well as inferencing.” the post claims. While the TPU outruns the P40 for inferencing, its memory bandwidth is less than a tenth that of the P40, Nvidia says. Nvidia isn't the only big name to present its own take on Google's performance claims. Last week, announcing it had taken the Chainer AI framework into its warm embrace, Intel claimed the project made Mountain View's TensorFlow look like it was working in treacle and outlined plans to make Xeons better than GPUs at the data-cruncing required to run AI code. ® Tips and corrections 8 Comments MORE Nvidia Google Gpu Benchmark More from The Register Nvidia welcomes Intel into AI era: Fancy a benchmark deathmatch?

Earlier this year, Apple sued Qualcomm for about $1 billion over royalties. Not to be outdone, Qualcomm is hitting back by countersuing Apple and yesterday Qualcomm filed its Answer and Counterclaims relating to January lawsuit. The full lawsuit is 139 pages (download link), but it boils down to Apple deliberately hindering the performance of Qualcomm chips in certain iPhone 7 models to make Intel chips look better. The five key statements are as follows. That Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm's long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm underscored Apple's reliance on them in their statement that "Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies." By choosing to not utilize some of the high-performance features of the newer chipsets, Qualcomm is claiming that the customers could not enjoy the full extent of their innovation. Apple had been using chipsets from both Qualcomm and Intel in some of their iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm believes their chips outperformed the Intel ones and that "Apple's actions were intended to prevent consumers from realizing that iPhones containing Qualcomm chipsets performed far better than iPhones containing chipsets supplied by Intel." Apple's response was that there was "no discernible difference" between the two chipsets. The lawsuit seeks damages from this as well as for Apple to stop interfering with deals between manufacturers and mobile components. Apple has responded to the suit by saying that "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties." Both lawsuits against each other allege some form of extortion based on patents or chip technologies. Patent lawsuits can be brutal and this one seems to be getting messier every month.

X Cork-based firm tackling the data deluge – with DNA Helixworks working on commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA about an hour ago Claire O'Connell Helixworks Technologies founders Sachin Chalapati and Nimesh Pinnamaneni at tech fest South by Southwest after winning the “most innovative” award for its work to make a commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA Previous Image Next Image         Getting noticed at the massive tech fest South by Southwest is no easy task. A maelstrom of talks, pitches and stands, the conference sprawls across numerous locations in downtown Austin, Texas, where a mix of established giants and energetic young hopefuls vie for attention. So when Cork-based company Helixworks Technologies got the chance to speak at the SXSW Accelerator Pitch Event, they made the most of it. And it paid off – the company won the “most innovative” award for its work to make a commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA. “Twitter was buzzing,” says Helixworks co-founder Nimesh Pinnamaneni of the reaction to the win. New twist on DNA storage Preserving digital information in DNA is not a new idea. The molecule that makes up our genomes has encoded information for billions of years, and advances in the technology to sequence (read) and – importantly – to write or synthesise DNA have opened up the prospect of converting digital data into a molecular code of DNA’s bases or “letters” that can be stored and then read when needed. Recent years have also seen the surge of big data, and expected global data is estimated at 44 trillion gigabytes by 2020, according to Dr Aisling O’Driscoll, a lecturer at Cork Institute of Technology. Can DNA absorb the digital demand? “DNA provides the first viable alternative to silicon,” says O’Driscoll, who has no connection to Helixworks but who is aware of their approach. “[DNA] offers a cheaper, long-term alternative that wouldn’t consume much physical space, would require little energy to maintain and has greater longevity as it won’t degrade like traditional data storage solutions. All the world’s data could be stored in DNA weighing less than one kilogram.” Life’s law In 2013, O’Driscoll and CIT colleague Prof Roy Sleator co-wrote a paper in the journal Bioengineered where they pointed out that Moore’s law – the famous dictum by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore about the growth of computing power – is making way for “life’s law”. At present though, DNA is not a “silver bullet”, notes O’Driscoll, and technical and commercial challenges remain. Key among them are the need to build a usable, reliable and affordable system for both writing and reading the encoded data. “It won’t be widely utilised unless it’s cost effective – not just data storage but also retrieval,” she says. “It won’t be cost effective until it’s widely commercialised, which won’t occur until the technology is sufficiently mature, fit for purpose and there’s competition in the market.” Steps to DNA storage Developing synthetic DNA as a storage medium is an active field of research for heavy hitters such as Microsoft, IBM and Harvard, so where does Helixworks fit in? The small company is striving to make “writing” information into artificial DNA simple and more affordable. “We are showing how we can try to bring this to a commercial product,” says Pinnamaneni. He and Helixworks co-founder Sachin Chalapati were inspired to explore DNA storage themselves when they were masters students in Sweden. They attended a talk by Craig Venter, a pioneer of human genomics and synthetic DNA, and they spoke to organisations that needed to store large volumes of data. The combination set the cogs in motion. “If you could throw the information into DNA, it would take up less space,” says Pinnamaneni. “This was an engineering problem.” They created a prototype that caught the eye of accelerator IndieBio EU (now RebelBio) in Cork, and they moved to Ireland. With backing from SOS Ventures and Enterprise Ireland’s New Frontiers programme, Helixworks has since been developing their technology, using a “Lego block” approach to assemble DNA in order to drive down costs. Early lessons The process has not gone without a hitch though. Last summer Helixworks offered a commercial product: 512 Kilobytes of data storage (enough for a poem or a small photo perhaps) in specially encoded DNA, packaged in a gold capsule. The orders came in – including one from a biotechnologist who wanted to encode an anniversary message for his wife – but the fledgling company soon realised it would take too long to fill them. “We learned a very important lesson,” says Pinnamaneni. “We were eager, but we didn’t understand the timeline it would take to deliver. When you are starting up things happen, and we learned this the hard way.” Now the focus is on automating their platform, according to Pinnamaneni, and the company has taken the open-source approach, freely sharing technical details on its website. “We want to get people excited,” he says. And while much remains to be proven about DNA storage, Pinnamaneni envisages that in years to come we could have a small DNA-based device in our homes to store the enormous amounts of data we generate. “[It would have] one writing part, one reader and one part for storing,” he says. “And it would just be there, a bit like the wifi router is now, just sitting there doing its job.”       Topics: Aisling O Driscoll Craig Venter Roy Sleator Sachin Chalapati Carlow Institute of Technology Cork Institute of Technology Enterprise Ireland Eu Harvard Helixworks Technologies IBM Intel Microsoft Sos Austin(US.TX) Ireland Sweden Read More Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Buymie gets your groceries to you when you need them Black Twist’s coffee and whiskey blend targets millennials Irish food sector must look to greater innovation The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated?

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, April 13, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Though smartphone does quite a lot of stuff done by computer, there are few other areas where people rely solely on their personal computers. How about having a device that works both as a smartphone and PC? This sounds interesting, right? Shane Lewis has come up with such an idea where a device named as Trinity runs Android Operating System and also functions as a Windows PC. Now he wants everyone to crowdfund this idea so that he can start with the shipping process by the end of 2017. That is, if he gets $767,000 on Indiegogo, he is having a plan of beginning the shipment in December. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Design: The design of this device is not so appealing. It is very thick compared to smartphones available in the market. It is having a thickness of 17.5mm. Also Read: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 likely to use Intel Kaby Lake processor It might reach 19mm once the project gets completed. The entry level device has a 5-inch display with 800 x 480 pixel capacitive touch screen. Features: One should not confuse this device with the dual-boot model. Trinity is having separate hardware for both Android and Windows 10 operating systems. But runs it simultaneously and allows you to switch between them without turning the device off. It comes with full-sized USB and HDMI ports in it which can be used to plug in a display, keyboard, or other accessories. Another interesting thing is, you can also plug in two different displays at the same time such as one for Android OS and another for Windows. Also Read: It is time to wave Goodbye to Windows Vista The Windows supported here is powered by an Intel processor, minimum of 4GB RAM, and 128GB of mSATA solid state storage. On the other hand, Android OS is powered by an ARM-based processor, 2GB RAM, and also a support for microSD card. The basic version of Trinity comes with a 13MP rear camera. For now, the device does not offer a good battery capacity. That is, only 4 hours of battery life under Android OS whereas, an hour if you use both the operating system simultaneously.   Availability: The entry level model of Trinity is priced at $699 whereas, an advanced model by name Trinity Turbo will be made available for $869 and powers Pentium N3710 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Also Read: Android stands out as a World's Most Popular OS by surpassing Windows If the price is not a concern for you, then you go for Trinity Ultimate which is priced at $959. It offers you Pentium N3710 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

The company submitted its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple's lawsuit, which was filed back in January. Among Qualcomm's five complaints is the allegation that Apple intentionally hobbled Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 so they wouldn't outperform those provided by Intel. Legally speaking, it has been a difficult year for Qualcomm. The initial lawsuit, filed in the US, was followed by additional suits in China and the United Kingdom. Before the Apple lawsuits, the company faced litigation from the US Federal Trade Commission for unfair business practices. In its countersuit, Qualcomm alleges that Apple "chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7," misrepresenting the difference in performance between iPhone models packing Qualcomm chips and those powered by its competitors. The company also claims Apple made threats in an attempt to keep it from making any public comparisons that might hint at the allegedly superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. With respect to the ongoing legal battle, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said: "After a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm." In addition, the countersuit claims Apple breached agreements and mischaracterized its negotiations with Qualcomm, interfered with longstanding agreements with Qualcomm licensees, and encouraged regulatory attacks against the company around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements. With total damages sought be both parties quickly racking up, it remains to be seen who will end up having to bear the ultimate cost should an out-of-court settlement not be reached.

Soft FP64 Patches For Intel Sandy Bridge Allow ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 April 2017 at 08:48 PM EDT. 1 Comment Elie Tournier, the GSoC student developer who last year worked via GSoC on "soft" FP64 double-precision support for older GPUs lacking the hardware capabilities, has posted patches wiring up his soft implementation for Intel "Gen 6" (Sandy Bridge) graphics thereby allowing ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 support. Tournier was hired by Collabora earlier this year for continuing his work around soft FP64. Today he's posted some "request for comments" patches on implementing soft FP64 support in NIR for handling ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 with the Sandy Bridge era hardware. Ivy Bridge and newer can have native FP64 support. Wiring in ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 could allow Sandy Bridge to expose OpenGL 4.0+, albeit FP64 isn't too relevant for games and thus Linux gamers finding a GL4 game playable with SNB graphics could already override the extensions / GL level. The work-in-progress patches can be found on Mesa-dev and amount to just under two thousand lines of code, nearly all of which is the NIR support for this emulated double-precision support. Hopefully we'll see R600g have similar support eventually as there are many GPUs missing out on FP64 / OpenGL 4.0+ support due to not having this capability. Collabora though tends to not focus much on Radeon drivers specifically and R600g doesn't make use of NIR. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | April 12, 2017 -- 23:43 GMT (16:43 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software When Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical and Ubuntu Linux leader, stepped down as CEO in favor of COO Jane Silber in 2010, no one was too worried. Silber may not have been flashy, but she knew how to keep the company moving forward. In a way, it was like Tim Cook taking over Apple after Steve Job's death. Jane Silber, Canonical CEO, will be moving to the company board while company and Ubuntu founder, Mark Shuttleworth, returns as CEO. Like Cook, Silber was a smart choice. Under her guidance, as she said in a recent PC Magazine interview, "Ubuntu has industry adoption that is both broad and deep. Companies such as Walmart, Netflix, and eBay build their infrastructure on Ubuntu. Telcos such as Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, and NTT build their next-generation telecom capabilities on Ubuntu." In addition, Ubuntu became the go-to operating system for all clouds. Even on Microsoft Azure, by last summer one in three Azure virtual machines were running Ubuntu. Moreover, Silber continued, "Companies such as Google and Intel use Ubuntu on their developer workstations. Further, Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers of gateways, networking devices, robots, and drones all use Ubuntu at scale." What Canonical could not do was make Ubuntu a major desktop player. Windows still dominates the desktop. What bothered Shuttleworth even more was that his dream of making Ubuntu a converged end-user operating system that could use the same Unity interface on smartphones, tablets, and PCs didn't come true. It was time for a change. what's hot on zdnet Microsoft confirms Spring launch is on for May 2 in New York City Recently patched Microsoft Word exploit was used by both governments and criminal hackers Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' 2017 annual letter: What decision-makers can learn Windows XP: Why it won't die for years to come Shuttleworth still isn't giving up on the Linux desktop. He has reason, and as Windows transforms from a true desktop operating system to Windows-as-a-Service, Linux still has another shot at the desktop. He has also decided to focus Canonical's efforts even more on the cloud and IoT. How he will be doing that is changing. While details are still sketchy, Canonical insiders tell me that Shuttleworth, for the first time in the private company's history, will look for outside funding. For that job, Shuttleworth wants to be in charge. So, Silber explained in a blog post, "We're now entering a new phase of accelerated growth at Canonical, and it's time to pass the baton to both seasoned hands and a new generation of Canonical leaders." While this look like a sudden decision from the outside, it's not. Silber said she'd "originally agreed to be CEO for five years and we've extended my tenure as CEO by a couple of years already." She also won't be leaving the job immediately. She'll remain the CEO until June 2017. She also won't be leaving Canonical. She will move to the Canonical Board of Directors. The dynamic Shuttleworth will take charge in July 2017. Before then, however, we should have a better idea on what his plans are for Canonical's next steps.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Hot Chips AMD launches its Ryzen 5 chips starting at $169 By Dan Thorp-Lancaster Tuesday, Apr 11, 2017 at 4:07 pm EDT 26 Comments After taking on the high end of the market with the release of its Ryzen 7 processors last month, AMD has today announced the launch of its more modest lineup of Ryzen 5 chips. And though they might be aimed squarely at mid-range PC builds, AMD's Ryzen 5 chips look to pack plenty of performance for the cost. All told, the Ryzen 5 lineup includes 4 chips ranging from $169 to $249. Here's a look: Processor Cores Threads Clock speed Price R5 1400 4 8 3.2GHz (3.4GHz) $169 R5 1500X 4 8 3.5GHz (3.7GHz) $189 R5 1600 6 12 3.2GHz (3.6GHz) $219 R5 1600X 6 12 3.6GHz (4.0GHz) $249 While Ryzen 7 is a head-to-head competitor for Intel's Core i7 chips, AMD has the Core i5 range in its sights with Ryen 5. In its own benchmarks, AMD is claiming "up to 87% more performance when comparing the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X to the Intel flagship Core i5 model, the 7600K." That's a bold claim, and we'll have to wait for independent benchmarks to see if AMD's claims hold up. However, if those numbers hold up, Ryzen 5 looks to give Intel a run for its money — especially for gamers. Ryzen 5 is available now at retailers worldwide, though availability may be limited initially. Hopefully, with two successful CPU launches behind in the rearview mirror, we'll get a look at AMD's plans for its Vega graphics chips soon.

But sadly not that good for gaming. It really depends on what you're doing with your PC. Still using my i5 3570k. -11 1 day ago Reply Cryio How is it not that good? It's as fast or faster than a i5 7600K overclocked to 4.8 GHz and it totally destroys the i5 if you'd ever intend to stream at the same time. 7 1 day ago Reply Blacklizted Don't worry. We all know that. Its just his defense mechanism working. I saw LinusTechTips' review of these and was amazed. 9 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle Defense mechanism? For what? I don't even have a CPU close to those CPUs. And I'm actually planning to switch to the R5 1600. I wanted to compare it's gaming performance to it's overall performance. For everything else but gaming it's a huge step over Intels i5s. I thought it would be the same for gaming but it's not. It's good but not a game changer for gaming. It's not that good. And talking about Linus: In most games the i5 7600k (not even OC) was better or on the same level as the R5 1600 on 4Ghz. In some cases the R5 had better low fps. Btw the Paul's Hardware review is much better. Especially for the Ryzen CPUs. Actually the i5 7500 performs not much worse in gaming than the R5 1600 (without the X) but is 50-60€ cheaper where I come from (i5 190€, R5 250€). The R5 1600 has the benefit of OC even with cheap mainboards. But even then it's not 60€ better in gaming. -7 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace It also has the advantage of being on a platform where the baords have a shelf life longer than a year. Zen 2 will use the same boards, it's usually good for 3-5 years. On the flip side, Intel will make you buy a new board with every iterative upgrade. 2 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle That's not true. 1151 is used for Skylake and Kaby Lake. AM4 will probably be used for Ryzen and Ryzen2. There's no difference. It's always two "generations". But AM4 is new. It's definitely the more future proof platform. -1 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace My mistake, though AMD still has long supported boards longer than Intel. Even going to AM3+ you could get support on some AM3 boards. 0 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace That's a total farce. The entire line of CPUs from AMD, and even Intel, is more than fine for gaming. Many reviews are now coming out saying R5 > i5 as a general purpose machine because it's only the less-capable game engine that really favor Intel's clock and IPC advantages. As more and more games use additional threads, the R5 will age better in newer gaming, and when paired with other tasks like streaming or any kind of CPU-heavy media work, the R5 runs away. What's more, you'll mostly find that so when putting the i5 against the 1600, which is cheaper than the 1600X and i5. 3 1 day ago Reply Pappale what are you talking about? Like seriously... aging? What? 90% of games are optimalised for consoles, they can take advantage of more cores but it has not much impact on the games performance... without proper optimalisation you wont see any significant changes. You can have 20 cores but if the game itself is optimalised for 4 cores and 8 threads then your + 20 cores will be useless and btw: modern games are GPU dependent, not CPU. Nowadays 4 cores + 8 threads are enough for everything. Streaming is something else, dont count it hear -9 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace "optimalised" And that's where you lost any chance at an intelligent argument. 5 1 day ago Reply Scabrat Actually, 90% of games arent optimised for consoles. Maybe console games that come out for pc as well but that is a small segment of pc games. It is true that all games are optimized for Intel cpus. That is because for the last 5 years AMD had no competition for pc gaming. It was all lead by Intel and Intel has an optimizer programing thing that devs can use to help them do that.  All that said, these AMD processors are really good and in the next 6 months I think most games will be optimized for both. Also, cpu actually does matter. You could have an fx processor and gtx 1080 and not get the frame rates as a new sky lake pentium processor with a gtx 1080. Every part matters for 1080 gaming. Every part really matters for 4k gaming...  2 1 day ago Reply nusense 1080p\1440p at high refresh rate yes, but 4k not so much. At 4k CPU are GPU bottled neck. That's why you see in benchmarks FX can keep up with Ryzen at 4k.  2 1 day ago Reply Fuchur84 And still there are games which already utilize more than 4 cores and which are very fast on the amds. The truth is: Currently it is not important which cpu you get because each of the new once will give you high framerates (above 90 fps) for the games available and it is just unlikely that anything is developed today with the aim to decrease multi-core usage. For anybody who is not only gaming, AMD's ryzens are a no brainer and if you want to be future proove, they are too. You only need an intel if the 110fps for games today is not enough for you and you need 120 fps for some games (in 1080p which is totally bullshit... Let alone is a resolution which is currently important but will be replaced by 4k sooner or later.) And keep in mind what scorpio is going to be. 0 1 day ago Reply Axmantim You really should just give up. After pressing through your spelling errors, saying 90% of games are optimized for consoles is a flat out false statement. Considering there are more than plenty of games that are only on PC, your statement just falls apart right there. Claiming streaming being something else is also a false statement. Today there are more streamers/ people that record than ever before, so it isn't something else. It's part of the gaming culture. Not only that, there's always more than just a game running on a PC. The OS is an obvious thing running (that is more resource intensive than a console OS) buit then there are any of the things a gamer may use to compliment their set up. Software that works with a joystic/keyboard/mouse, software for voice chat..etc. 0 16 hours ago Reply nusense Lmao good luck with the AMD defense force.  -9 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle yeah I really don't know why everyone is so aggressive when it comes to AMD/Intel. It's just a CPU. -1 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace I don't get why people gather little information, then say something as asinine as "these aren't good for gaming," yet here you are. 4 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle I never said that they are not good for gaming. Maybe you should just read what I wrote here. 0 1 day ago Reply Keith Wallace "not that good for gaming" Completely ignores reality, as they are well beyond competent. Where Intel wins, it's mainly older games/enginges, and it's something like 150 FPS vs. 135, where there isn't actually a noticeable benefit. There are also games where Ryzen won out. I guess the word "that" was left out in my quoting, but it doesn't change how woefully ignorant the statement was in the first place. I suppos it is a big problem that Anandtech tested the R5 and i5 stuff, and found that the R5 1600X lost out in Shadow of Mordor by 8% at 1080p and that it lost out by 0.4% at 4K. Just not that good...even if the R5 1500X (te cheaper model) beat the i5 in Civ 6 by over 18% at 1080p and about the same at 4K. What's more, you couldn't even gather facts to support the claim about the R5's lack of performance, even as you can go to a swamr of mass market articles for contradictory information, whether it be Linus, Anandtech, PCWorld, Digital Trends, or any of the others you can find if you go to Bing and type in "Ryzen 5 review," meaning even the littlest bits of effort note how ridiculous your claims are. Oh, no, Ryzen ran at 150 FPS, and not 170 in a game where settings were turned down absurdly low to fake a struggle by the CPU? WHAT WILL WE DO?!?! 2 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle yeah you definitely NOT read what I wrote here. Thanks for the clarification. -2 1 day ago Reply Sin Ogaris Everyone is aggressive in regards to EVERYTHING, no one can accept that perhaps a product they didn't buy could also be good. It's like if someone sees that another product is as good, or better, then suddenly their decision was wrong or something stupid like that and they can't handle it. Whereas, in actual fact, there can be multiple good products that, shock horror, come from different manufacturers. 1 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle exactly. I don't understand why people hate that much over products. 0 21 hours ago Reply kz_m You want good CPU for gaming buy Ryzen 7 + high end GPU. 1 1 day ago Reply mab664 ...coming soon to a Scorpio near you.(oh wait..) -1 1 day ago Reply Apfel Schorle I wish it would. But probably it has some of it's improvements. 0 1 day ago Reply th34monk3ys After buying the 1800x would I complain if I had a 1600x plus for gaming or even a 1400 overclocked. The answer is no! I would not pay intel a penny (English deal with it) and has made the market all over a game changer on price per performance. 52% pick boost over previous gen and futureproofing! The fact is this is a monumental change for cpu history says it all. 0 23 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

 Microsoft is caught in an impossible smartphone situation Matt Weinberger Apr. 12, 2017, 5:54 PM 18,235 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay with the Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950XL phones. Getty Images/Andrew Burton We're hearing from sources that when Microsoft holds its next big event on May 2, neither the next-generation Surface Pro 5 tablet nor the long-rumored Surface Phone will be making appearances.  Just to back up for a second, the still-unofficial Surface Phone is considered to be Microsoft's very last shot at making Windows a serious smartphone contender against Apple and Google, as Windows phones slip under 1% global market share. Microsoft hasn't shipped a flagship Windows phone since late 2015's Lumia 950. And while you can read pretty much anything into the Surface Phone's absence, the fact we're hearing it won't be shown at least indicates it's probably still in the works — something that was in doubt, after going over a year without any kind of substantial update.  That's exacerbated by years of reports indicating that it's been a bumpy road for Microsoft. Originally rumored to be unveiled in mid-2016, the Surface Phone slipped into late 2017 (or maybe early 2018, if you believe an anonymous Reddit user). And Intel cancelled the processor that Microsoft was supposedly eyeing to power the device. Meanwhile, Microsoft has filled the gap in its own smartphone lineup by doubling down on iOS and Android. Notably, Microsoft partnered up with Samsung to offer a custom version of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 phone, making it the most premium Microsoft phone on the market. Now, with super-fans baying for the company to recommit to Windows on phones, but the rest of the world increasingly apathetic, Microsoft is damned if it does release a Surface Phone, and damned if it doesn't. Damned if you do The rumor is that this hypothetical Surface Phone will be a powerful flagship Windows 10 Mobile phone with at least one absolutely killer feature: The ability to plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and use it like an honest-to-goodness, full-on Windows PC, letting you run desktop PC software on a device you can pocket. It sounds great on paper. But it seems extremely unlikely that even if Microsoft releases the coolest, most innovative phone ever made, it could get anybody to care. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Justin Sullivan/Getty Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made a big bet on Windows 10's Universal Windows Platform, where developers can write Windows 10 apps that run on PCs, tablets, and smartphones alike. But apart from a few high-profile apps from developers like Uber and Facebook, the Windows Store is still pretty dire, as most developers pass over Windows 10 for the way more popular iPhone and Android platforms.  And given that Windows 10 Mobile currently doesn't have apps like Snapchat or "Pokémon Go," and that companies like Spotify are pulling their Windows phone apps as market share vanishes, good luck getting an iPhone or Android user to switch. So it almost doesn't matter what the Surface Phone turns out to be. Unless it's a massive, market-defining hit like the first iPhone, it's not going to draw enough developers back to the Windows Store to make a difference. Head-to-head with the iPhone or Google Pixel, this phone could maybe win a battle. But Windows 10 Mobile won't win any kind of war. Damned if you don't When Microsoft and Samsung announced their Galaxy S8 collaboration, Windows fans weren't happy. To them, the partnership was a signal that Microsoft cared a lot more about Android than it does about Windows 10 Mobile. "Just put Windows mobile out of it's [sic] misery already and stop yanking us around," wrote one Reddit commenter, in part, following the news. Indeed, Samsung's own DeX, which lets you plug the Galaxy S8 into a monitor and use it like a PC, is a huge step towards fulfilling the Surface Phone dream, built on Android. With Microsoft giving the Galaxy S8 an explicit endorsement, it definitely looks like they've given up on their own phone platform. Samsung Galaxy S8 Business Insider And yet, Microsoft can't throw in the towel. With PC sales shrinking, Microsoft needs to prove to itself and the world that Windows is still relevant. So while the company is working on nifty holographic technology that it thinks will render smartphones obsolete, that's probably a decade away from being released as a full product. In the meantime, smartphones are here to stay. And so, whether or not it's a huge hit, Microsoft needs something like a Surface Phone just to keep Windows in the conversation. Windows 10 on PCs and tablets is pretty great, but without a smartphone, the platform appears a little backwards-looking. Bottom line If you're a Star Trek fan, this is Microsoft's own Kobayashi Maru — a no-win scenario that tests your priorities under an impossible situation. If Microsoft opts not to release a phone, it's a clear sign that it's taking the far more realistic approach of providing apps and services for Android and iOS phones, which is a lucrative business for the company. That comes at the very possible cost of Windows' future prospects as the world continues to move towards the smartphone, but the continued growth of its Office 365 subscription service. Collider But if Microsoft does release a phone, it shows that the company is committed to Windows, one of the very major reasons it became a titan of technology in the first place. This has a potentially higher payoff, as it could be the breakthrough device that pushes Windows 10 Mobile into the mainstream, and ensure Windows' relevance for another several years. Or it could keep Microsoft shackled to a shrinking, legacy business. In other words, Microsoft can't win with the Surface Phone. It can, however, choose the way that it loses.

DRM Changes To Look Forward To With Linux 4.12: Vega, Atomic Intel, Accelerated Pascal Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 12 April 2017 at 03:03 PM EDT. Add A Comment With the end of feature material for DRM-Next having passed for Linux 4.12, here is a look at some of the changes you will be able to find with the Direct Rendering Manager code when the cycle begins for the Linux 4.12 kernel. Some of the DRM highlights we've been monitoring for code that's now staged in DRM-Next until the Linux 4.12 merge window in the next few weeks includes: - Intel's DRM driver has now enabled atomic mode-setting by default and this affects Ironlake hardware and newer. The Intel driver also has GuC and HuC refactoring , GPU reset improvements, power management alterations, and the usual assortment of changes. There are also GVT-g changes. - AMD has landed initial Vega10 GPU support for the upcoming Radeon RX Vega GPU launch expected at the end of May. But For Linux 4.12 this doesn't include any Vega display support as DC (formerly DAL) wasn't ready to merge in time. Thus Vega with a vanilla Linux 4.12 kernel would only be useful for compute-type scenarios. DC support will come later thereby enabling Vega display support, so at-launch you'll either need to spin your own kernel from a DC branch or use the AMDGPU-DRM driver. - There is also an assortment of other AMDGPU changes including GPU sensor support, SR-IOV improvements, PRT support (needed for ARB_sparse_buffer support), TTM memory management improvements, and more. - With this AMDGPU DRM-Next code we have been seeing some performance improvements across different hardware. - Initial accelerated Pascal support on Nouveau. While this GTX 1000 series support has landed, it still requires new signed firmware image binaries recently released by NVIDIA. Additionally, similar to Maxwell, this Pascal Nouveau support lacks re-clocking so the performance is expected to be quite slow. - Nouveau also has GP10B support, a.k.a. the Tegra X2 Pascal GPU found on the Jetson TX2 developer board. - Freedreno's MSM driver has 4k display support for newer hardware. - Mediatek MT2701 display support. - VC4 HDMI audio support is in place as a big win for Raspberry Pi users. - Various improvements to Etnaviv, the reverse-engineered Vivante driver. Those are the DRM highlights slated for Linux 4.12 that come to mind based upon our past coverage. Stay tuned for more Linux 4.12 kernel feature coverage when the merge window opens up around month's end.

Brooks is working with Jordan Glaze, an Innovator with the Aggie Innovation Space, to create two parts for the prototype. (NMSU photo by Tiffany Acosta) New Mexico State University Department of Animal and Range sciences junior Josiah Brooks is creating a feed intake device for cattle, and he is working with the Aggie Innovation Space to design and develop parts for a prototype.  Through an NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences USDA-Hispanic Serving Institution LEADERS grant awarded to the Animal Science Department, Brooks is conducting a research trial to develop a marker system to determine feed intake in grazing cattle that will allow researchers to investigate how grazing management and supplementation programs can improve cattle health and performance.  To properly manage rangelands, ranchers need to understand grazing cattle nutrition and have the ability to quantify how much cattle eat when they are grazing in a pasture, according to Eric Scholljegerdes, Animal and Range Sciences associate professor and Brooks’ faculty adviser.    Jordan Glaze, a New Mexico State University junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering and Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space, helped Josiah Brooks create a prototype of a feed intake device for cattle. (NMSU photo by Tiffany Acosta) Researchers obtain this data with an inert marker (not digested), titanium dioxide, which is typically administered to cattle twice daily. Unfortunately, this dosing method requires manpower and interrupts grazing. Brooks is working on a device that will be inserted into the stomach of cattle and will automatically release the marker over a period of time. To create a cap and a plunger for a prototype, Brooks has been working with Jordan Glaze, an Aggie Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space Presented by Intel in the College of Engineering.  “The Aggie Innovation Space has allowed us to develop parts for this device that would otherwise be unavailable,” Scholljegerdes said. “We are very grateful for the wonderful help we have received thus far from the personnel at the Aggie Innovation Space. Without their help we would not be where we are at in the development process.” As a former engineering student, Brooks knew about the Aggie Innovation Space and started working with Glaze in late 2016.  “I’m extremely happy with the Aggie Innovation Space,” Brooks said. “Jordan, specifically, because working with that level of technology is extremely challenging. I didn’t realize how much effort went into designing something on a software program.”  “You can’t do that without patience and you can’t do that unless you have a passion,” he added. “You feel welcome as a student even though you are not in the department, a completely different department, but they help and that’s what they want to do and that’s their passion. It’s been a very positive experience for me. I wouldn’t have gone back if I didn’t get that experience.” A junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering, Glaze said he has enjoyed working with Brooks on his first animal science project. A few of projects Glaze has recently assisted on are from the industrial engineering department, art department, geology department and a community outreach project for a dog wheelchair for a NMSU employee.  “The Aggie Innovation Space is based around developing cross disciplinary skills focused on engineering specifically, but also branching out into different disciplines such as this case being animal science,” Glaze said.  “We guide projects from the very first stage, and work with our clients to help them get to the prototyping and later the manufacturing stages,” Glaze noted. “We work very hard to make projects successful, but focus on not doing the project for the client. We want them to learn and take away something when the project is said and done, and hopefully give them the guidelines to follow for future projects.” While Brooks and Glaze are continuing to work on a prototype, Scholljegerdes hopes to test the device on cattle this summer. If successful, Brooks and Scholljegerdes would like to patent the device.  Information from NMSU TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2017 KRWG Donate Now Search Contact Us Listen LIVE Regional Local Viewpoints KRWG News Video National/World Business Health Sports Weather NM Roads TX Roads Community Events Where to Watch & Listen Radio Schedule TV Schedule PBS and KRWG Video

If that's the case, the two new motherboards coming from Asus' ROG division may be a surprise. Check out the B250H Gaming and B250G Gaming. Both of these LGA 1151 mobos use Intel's B250 chipset and provide budget-priced platforms for high-performance gaming rigs. These actually aren't ROG's first motherboards using the B250 chipset—the B250F Gaming holds that title. The two new offerings skip a few of the niceties on that model (like USB 3.1 ports) in exchange for a spiffy black-and-red color scheme and a lower price. You still get four DDR4 memory slots, six USB 3.0 ports, six 6 Gbps SATA ports, and a pair of PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 sockets. One of the M.2 sockets on each board also supports an Optane cache drive, while the other supports SATA M.2 drives. Asus opted for Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet on these boards, while audio comes by way of the ROG "SupremeFX" suite powered by Realtek's excellent ALC1220 codec. The only difference in the two boards is that the B250H Gaming is an ATX motherboard while the B250G fits a microATX form factor. The extra size wins the B250H an extra PCIe x16 slot (only x4 electrically) and an extra PCIe x1 slot.  Of course, all overclocking is locked out on motherboards using Intel's B250 chipset, including memory overclocking. As a result, CPUs will be limited to their maximum turbo frequency, and memory speeds will be limited to 2400 MT/s. However, given the high clock rates on offer from Intel's latest CPUs, we reckon all but the most demanding gamers will be satisfied with the stock speeds. We couldn't find the B250G Gaming or B250H Gaming at e-tail yet, but the Guru of 3D got word that Asus will be asking €129 (or $137) for the B250H Gaming and just €99 ($105) for the B250G.

WASHINGTON, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The National Forest Foundation (NFF) is pleased to announce the winner of the 2016/2017 Barrett Foundation Business Concept Challenge. This unique competition provides awards for the best entrepreneurial approaches that help to solve one or more of the challenges facing America's 193-million-acre National Forest System. Sponsor Dr. Craig R. Barrett, former Chairman and CEO of Intel and current Chairman of the NFF's Board of Directors, described the purpose of this competition as, "stimulating new ideas and cultivating the next generation of entrepreneurial natural resource and business leaders." This year's winner, the Sierra Institute for Community and Environment, submitted an innovative proposal that meets Barrett's vision of the Challenge. 2016/2017 Barrett Challenge WinnerThe Sierra Institute proposed capitalizing on California's unique energy markets and its abundant source of wood biomass. The Institute's proposal calls for a three megawatt combined heat and power (CHP) energy facility powered by local, sustainably harvested wood, co-located with other wood-products businesses. The plant would be located in rural Plumas County, California, an area hit especially hard by downturns in the timber industry and with National Forests making up two-thirds of the County, much of them fire-prone.   Traditional thinking suggests that it's not economically viable to build a small-scale CHP facility in the rural region where the Institute is proposing to build this plant. Yet Plumas County, which has lost thousands of timber-related jobs since the 1990s, would benefit immensely from such a plant. Additionally, as a small nonprofit, the Institute would unlikely be unable to raise enough capital to finance a biomass plant of this type. To address these concerns and move the project forward, the team created a coalition of project sponsors and proposed a small-scale biomass plant co-located with other wood-products industries like the first cross-laminated-timber (CLT) mill in California, a firewood production facility, a wood chip processing facility for use by local biomass boilers in the County, and even a greenhouse heated by the biomass energy plant. The CHP plant would sell renewable energy to California's uniquely regulated energy market and would sell heat created by the biomass facility to the other business co-located on the campus. All the businesses would utilize locally and sustainably harvested wood from nearby National Forests, adding further value by reducing the Forests' risk of uncharacteristic wildfire and improving forest health. This model makes it economically viable for a nonprofit to build such a small energy plant in a rural community. This project seeks to demonstrate that nonprofits can leverage market forces to create community-scale development projects that address forest health, create local jobs and produce valuable products in small, rural communities. The Institute believes, "This project will demonstrate how a facility utilizing local, sustainably harvested biomass can generate efficient renewable energy and with co-product development be financially viable." Executive Director of the Sierra Institute, Jonathan Kusel, stated, "We're thrilled to be recognized for this work and the excellent work of our close partners on the project, and thrilled also because this award is reflective of the collective effort of the many rural communities across California we're privileged to work with." "This year's prize winner promises to deliver the results we developed the Barrett Challenge to stimulate," said Bill Possiel, President of the NFF. "By beginning from the ground up and envisioning an enterprise that combines multiple wood-products and utilizes heat and energy as additional value-added products, the Sierra Institute has developed an idea that can benefit both the local community and the National Forests that surround it." The Sierra Institute will be recognized at an award ceremony April 19, in Washington, DC.

Back to site Syria Cold War Audio ‘Words Are Also Deeds’: Unverified Stories and the Growing Risk of War With Russia ‘Words Are Also Deeds’: Unverified Stories and the Growing Risk of War With Russia The US narratives for which there are as of yet no facts could lead to direct military conflict between Washington and Moscow. By Stephen F. Cohen Yesterday 11:11 am Facebook Twitter Email Print The John Batchelor Show, April 11 Nation contributing editor Stephen F. Cohen and John Batchelor continue their weekly discussions of the new US-Russia Cold War. (Previous installments, now in their fourth year, are at TheNation.com.) Ad Policy Cohen argues that the American political-media establishment has embraced two fraught narratives for which there is still no public evidence, only “intel” allegations. One, “Kremlingate,” as it is being called, is that Russian President Putin ordered a hacking of the Democratic National Committee and disseminated e-mails found there to help put Donald Trump in the White House. The other is that Syrian President Assad, Putin’s ally, ordered last week’s chemical-weapons attack on Syrian civilians, including young children. A third faith-based narrative, promoted by MSNBC in particular, is now emerging linking the other two: that Trump’s recent missile attack on a Syrian military air base was actually a Putin-Trump plot to free the new American president from the constraints of “Kremlingate” investigations and enable him to do Putin’s bidding in matters of US national security. Cohen points out that in addition to the absence of any actual evidence for these allegations, there is no logic. The explanation that Putin “hated Hillary Clinton” for protests that took place in Moscow in 2011 is based on a misrepresentation of that event. And why would Assad resort to the use of chemical weapons, thereby risking all the military, political, and diplomatic gains he has achieved in the past year and half, and considering that he had Russian air power at his disposal as an alternative? And the emerging sub-narrative that Putin lied in 2013, when he and President Obama agreed that Assad would destroy all of his chemical weapons, is based on another factual misrepresentation. It was the United Nations and its special agency that verified the full destruction of those weapons, not Putin. (This allegation is clearly intended to discredit the one important act of US-Russian cooperation, a vital one, in recent years.) THE STAKES ARE HIGHER NOW THAN EVER. GET THE NATION IN YOUR INBOX. The Russian adage “words are also deeds” is proving true, it seems. Trump’s missile attack on Russia’s ally Syria, despite its ramifying dangers, may have had a domestic political purpose—to debunk the narrative that is crippling his presidency, that he is somehow “Putin’s puppet.” If so, Cohen adds, the American mainstream media, which has promoted this narrative for months, is deeply complicit. Meanwhile, the Kremlin, which watches closely as these narratives unfold politically in Washington, has become deeply alarmed, resorting to its own fraught words. The No. 2 leader, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, declared that US-Russian relations have been “ruined,” a statement Cohen does not recall any previous Soviet or post-Soviet leader ever having made. Medvedev added that the two nuclear superpowers are at “the brink” of war. Considering that Medvedev is regarded as the leading pro-Western figure in Putin’s inner circle, imagine what the other side—state patriots, or nationalists, as they are called—is telling Putin. Still more, the Kremlin is saying that Trump’s missile attack on Syria crossed Russia’s “red lines,” with all the warfare implications that term has in Washington as well. And flatly declaring the mysterious use of chemical weapons in Syria a “provocation,” Putin himself warned that forces in Washington were planning more such “provocations” and military strikes. In short, while the Kremlin does not want and will not start a war with the United States, it is preparing for the possibility.  Most Popular 1 A Big Win for Voting Rights in Texas and a Big Loss for Trump 2 Coulda Woulda Shoulda—Democrats Miss a Huge Opportunity in Kansas 3 Where Is America’s Next War? Alaska. 4 Why Today’s GOP Crackup Is the Final Unraveling of Nixon’s ‘Southern Strategy’ 5 Democrats Shouldn’t Be Trying to Banish Tulsi Gabbard Cohen and Batchelor ended their broadcast as Trump’s new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had just arrived in Moscow, before his talks with Russian leaders began the following day. (Whether or not Putin himself would met with Tillerson, or only Foreign Minister Lavrov, was still uncertain. Putin may be an authoritarian leader, the “decider,” but influential forces in and around the Kremlin were strongly against Putin meeting with an American secretary of state in the immediate aftermath of such a US “provocation.”) Whatever the case, Cohen thinks Tillerson’s visit is vitally important, at least for the Russian leadership, and for Putin in particular. Tillerson is well known to Putin and other Kremlin leaders. On behalf of ExxonMobil, he negotiated with them one of Russia’s largest energy deals, which would grant access to the nation’s vast oil resources beneath frozen seas. Putin personally approved the deal, which oil giants around the world sought. He would not have done so had he not concluded that Tillerson was a serious, highly competent man. (For this achievement on behalf of a major American corporation, Tillerson too has been slurred as “Putin’s friend” in the American media.) The Kremlin will therefore expect candid answers from Tillerson to these questions related to the looming issue of war or peace. Are the fact-free narratives now prevailing in Washington the determining factor in Trump’s policy toward Russia? Are they the reason Trump committed the “provocation” in Syria? Does this mean that Trump no longer shares, or can support, Russia’s essential strategic premise regarding the civil and proxy war in Syria—that the overthrow of Assad would almost certainly mean ISIS or another terrorist army in Damascus, an outcome that the Kremlin regards as a dire threat to Russia’s own national security? And, most fundamentally, who is making Russia policy in Washington: President Trump or someone else? Putin, it should be recalled, asked the same question publicly about President Obama, when the agreement Putin and Obama negotiated for military cooperation in Syria was sabotaged by the US Department of Defense. The answers that the very experienced Tillerson—he had his own corporate global state department and intelligence service at ExxonMobil—gives may do much to determine whether or not the new Cold War moves even closer to the “brink” of hot war, certainly in Syria. Meanwhile, the American mainstream media should return to their once professed practice of rigorously fact-checking their narratives with an understanding that words are indeed also deeds.

New Balance is a brand most will know for its sports apparel but, like Under Armour and Nike before, it’s now branching out into the sporting technology space. The New Balance RunIQ is its first running wearable, created in partnership with running and cycling platform Strava with an Intel chip inside. As such, Strava is integrated heavily into the RunIQ, tapping into the RunIQ’s range of sensors in order to track your run and biometrics and automatically uploading your runs to the community platform. But while the New Balance RunIQ on paper includes everything you might want from a running-oriented smartwatch, its execution is rather lacking, from middling battery life to a slightly disappointing display. In the end it comes up short when up against other laser-focussed running rivals like the similar Android Wear-powered Polar M600 or even the smart feature-lacking TomTom Spark 3. Related: Best Fitness Tracker Roundup New Balance RunIQ – Design and screen The New Balance RunIQ is, first and foremost, a sports-oriented smartwatch, so it has a design to match. It has a round design, which for me gives it the immediate edge against the likes of the Polar M600 in the design stakes. That said, it’s still a rather chunky beast of a watch that’s not going to win many awards for style – in fairness that sentiment can apply to most running watches. At around 14mm in thickness, it’s actually not that much thicker than a smartwatch like the Huawei Watch 2, but it is noticeably heavier, which is more of an issue when slapping something on your wrist during a run. As for the display, there’s a circular 1.39-inch OLED display with 400 x 400 resolution. There’s also no ‘flat tyre’ in sight. While it supports always-on display, which shows a power-sipping monochrome watch face when not in use, it was disappointing to not have an ambient light sensor to automatically adjust brightness. Related: Best Smartwatch roundup When outdoors, you’re going to have to crank the display up to its maximum to see anything, especially when quickly glancing during a run. While indoors, I preferred to have to the watch set to a level 3 (out of 5) brightness, which simply doesn’t cut it on a bright day. There is also the Brightness Boost option available from Android Wear’s quick shortcuts, but that’s also not the most convenient. The RunIQ has an all black colour scheme used for the casing, which is made from metal yet feels surprisingly like plastic. It feels sturdy enough, though, and leaves you less concerned about it dealing with the sweat and rigours of a long run. Flip the watch over and there’s an optical heart rate monitor and contacts for the magnetic charger. As the watch is water resistant to 5ATM (50 metres), you’re safe to wear it in the shower or go for a swim. Along the edge is a non-rotating crown flanked by two additional buttons. The central crown button acts as a shortcut to your Android Wear apps list when held, while the top button provides quick access to tracking a run or cycle. The bottom button is a shortcut to Google Play Music. I couldn’t find any way to customise the shortcuts, as I would have liked to have changed the bottom button as I’m not much of a Google Play Music user. If you transfer some music directly to the watch’s storage this will be useful at least. Oddly, I found the bottom button very difficult to press, as it was noticeably stiffer, meaning I had to call upon an opposing thumb in order to press it reliably. The perforated, and similarly black and drab, silicone band has little arrow shaped cutouts that give some visual interest and also helps with the breathability of the strap. Some might argue they’re little heart shaped cutouts but that’s not immediately obvious as they’re upside when the watch is on your wrist. As these perforations are used for the watch buckle, it also meant a more adjustable fit due to a greater variety of sizing options. Another positive of the band is that it doesn’t pick up lint and fluff as has been the case with other silicone straps I’ve worn, which can leave your wearable looking rather dishevelled after a while.

The game is said to be a return to form for the series, taking us back to the World War 2 setting that built the franchise. So….. Rumor: Call of Duty: WW2 Release Date and PS4 Exclusive Deal Leaked Share Tweet by Kyle Hanson on April 12, 2017 For a game that doesn’t officially exist, we sure are learning a lot about Call of Duty: WW2. The game is said to be a return to form for the series, taking us back to the World War 2 setting that built the franchise. So far Activision has not confirmed the game’s existence, beyond the fact that we know a CoD game is coming every single year. Now, along with the setting, we might have more info about the game, with a new leak focused on the Call of Duty: WW2 release date and PS4 exclusive deal. According to a promotional poster spotted by a YouTuber then share by fansite Charlie Intel, Call of Duty: WW2 will hit on November 3rd. Along with this info, the poster showed that Sony has retained their DLC exclusivity deal, with players on PS4 getting 30 days of exclusive early access to all new maps and content. These leaks and rumors are starting to pile up here, but I’d still recommend exercising extreme caution. So far everything has come from some less than reputable sources, especially this last release date leak. We still want to share the info, especially since it does fit a lot with what is expected from this latest entry in the series. However, definitely take all of this as rumor and speculation until we hear from Activision themselves. I’d expect to see the official reveal hit at E3. If they do turn out as true then fans have a lot to be excited about. Call of Duty has been stuck in either modern times or the near future for the last few entries. This has caused a bit of a drag on reception for these games, with fans wanting something more classically styled. If Call of Duty: WW2 ends up being the real game then they’ll certainly get it.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company?

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Visual Computing Market – High Internet Penetration And Cloud Based Services Is Mainly Driving The Market Computers are being increasingly used to process digital images, video and visual reproduction. Visual computing means the ability to transform information into images and to gain information from images. The visual data can be block diagrams, simple icons 3-D scenes, photo, and video. These are used to describe either computer environment or application with huge or numerical data files like video sequences, 3-D scenes and images. Visual computing finds application in graphics, visualization, animation technology, video processing and image, multimedia communication and interaction among others. Cyber world, visual computing is helping to transform the data to visual to facilitate better and effective more easy processes to gain from the data it contains .increasing demand for simulation products and virtual reality is expected to create a large market potential for visual computing market. Moreover, increasing focus on gaming graphics card to increase the accuracy level of games is also predicted to accelerate the demand of gaming industries. This in turn is acting as a driving factor in the growth of visual computing market in the coming years. The visual computing market is expected to grow at a steady rate during the forecast period from 2016 to 2024. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/visual-computing-marke… In order to provide detailed analysis of the market, the visual computing market is segmented on the basis of component, display, end use industry, and geography. On the basis of component, market is bifurcated into hardware and software. On the basis of display, market is further fragmented into monitors, whiteboards and others. Increasing demand of white boards as a result of increasing engagement in collaborative production, boost communication and greater range of data share and connectivity and mobile connectivity is acting as a driving factor in the growth of visual computing market. On the basis of end use industry, market can be classified into gaming, entertainment and media management information systems .On the other hand, information regarding current market synopsis and future trend in respect of all the above mentioned segments across various regions including Europe, North America, Asia Pacifica, Middle-East and Africa (MEA) and Latin America is also provided in this report. One of the important factors restraining the visual market is high establishment and manufacturing cost followed by sensitivity to lighting conditions. Geographically, the visual computing market is majorly driven by North America. In 2015, North America held the largest market share in terms of revenue. High internet penetration and cloud based services is mainly driving the North America visual computing market. In addition, increasing focus on research and development activities by key players operating in visual computing market is also acting as a driving factor in the growth of this market. In terms of revenue, the visual computing market of North America is followed by Europe. Asia Pacific is predicted to witness the most promising market in the coming years, owing to increasing internet penetration followed by growing demand for high definition gaming consoles. NVidia Corp. (U.S), one of the leading player in this market is heavily invested in visual computing and virtual reality. The market of visual computing is consolidated in nature with few companies holding majority of the market share. In 2015, NVidia corp.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Display Week Promises To Immerse Attendees In The Exciting World Of Augmented And Virtual Reality Dedicated Event on AR/VR, Together with Dozens of Exhibitors and Technical Symposium Talks, to Focus on Market Opportunities within Reach Over Next Few Years CAMPBELL, Calif., April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Society for Information Display (SID) is gearing up to explore the exciting world of augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) during its annual Display Week, to be held May 21-26 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. To this end, SID is teaming with Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), the OLED Association and Veritas et Visus, to produce the AR/VR Market Focus Conference (Wed., May 24th). This dedicated one-day conference, together with dozens of exhibitors and technical presentations throughout Display Week, will center on this exciting arena—offering attendees a unique experience unlike any other on the massive market potential afforded by AR and VR technologies over the next several years. AR and VR are sometimes used interchangeably, but these technologies have very distinct differences and uses. While VR is fully immersive, shutting out one's surroundings, AR provides a virtual overlay to what the viewer is seeing in the real world—making VR ideal for gaming and entertainment, while AR is touted more for data-driven uses, like education and healthcare. This difference requires displays with different levels of performance. Displays for VR applications are typically larger, have very high resolution, high color gamut and high contrast with low to moderate brightness. On the other hand, displays for AR applications are smaller and require very high brightness while the color gamut and contrast requirements are moderate. As such, there is a growing trend in the industry that microdisplays (LCOS or OLED-based) could be the holy grail in satisfying both VR and AR requirements—a highly topical theme at this year's show.  According to Sri Peruvemba, SID Marketing Chair, "It's hard not to miss the news surrounding the AR/VR markets emerging in front of us, literally and figuratively. But there still are a lot of questions out there and general misperceptions. SID's premier Display Week is the ideal gathering for display experts, consumer electronics companies, integrators and general enthusiasts to all come together to look beyond the chatter and hype and really delve into what's needed for these technologies to build the ecosystem necessary to realize widespread acceptance and adoption." Specifically, the AR/VR Market Focus Conference (part of the SID and DSCC co-produced Business Track) will examine the business and technical issues associated with these categories, and feature an exciting AR/VR device shootout among some of the best technologies currently on the market.  The event will also feature compelling morning and afternoon keynotes from Ron Azuma, principal engineer at Intel Labs, on the characteristics and needs of AR and VR systems, particularly from display technologies; and John Fan, CEO of Kopin, on the era of microdisplays for AR/VR platforms, respectively.  The event will also have featured speaker, John Underkoffler, Founder and CEO at Oblong Industries, and creator of the interactive imagery from "The Minority Report," during one of the highly-anticipated sessions, Representing Reality—Creating the Immersive Experience.  Beyond that, there are a number of other session presentations and guaranteed lively panel discussions from experts spanning the ecosystem, and cover a sampling of topics that include: VR is a booming market; AR is expected to see similar market opportunities, but many analysts expect that a "mixed reality" solution may ultimately dominate. This will be explored in more depth along with the confluence of markets demanding these mixed market opportunities; New ways in which VR gaming solutions, such as VR headsets, are going to not only change the way we play games, but how we interact with large-scale visual modeling, etc.; and, Insight into what's coming next in VR software While a full agenda and topics are listed here, speakers include a number of top experts from AMD, Argus Insights, Avegant, eMagin, Eon Reality, Fovi 3D, Immersive Technology Alliance, Jon Peddie Research, Luminit, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Sony, Samsung Display, Samsung Electronics and Triple Take Holographics. Beyond the Market Focus Conference, there are a large number of companies exhibiting at Display Week that are involved in the AR/VR and wearables space.  These, together with academic and industry experts speaking at the much-lauded Technical Symposium, will take these discussions to another level—making this week-long event a must see for those looking to get a better understanding of, or network with, the top trailblazers in the AR/VR and wearables space. The sessions are designed for scientists, engineers, business professionals, market analysts and industry leaders involved in AR/VR technologies, products, applications, advanced developments and emerging trends, and include: Systems and Applications Display Technologies for AR and VR Systems 3D-Sensing and Imaging Technologies Spatial Tracking, Localization, Mapping, and Navigation Techniques Computation, Graphics, and Display Processing Immersive Audio Technologies End-to-End System Integration and Latencies Inputs, Interfaces, and Interactions Human Factors and User Experience Considerations Mapping and Rendering of Virtual Objects onto Physical World Object, Human and Scene Capture, Reconstruction, Recognition and Understanding Biometrics and User Authentication For more information on the exhibiting companies and Technical Symposium speakers at Display Week, visit www.displayweek.org. Editor Background—VR vs. AR? Some pundits view VR as the hare in this space, while casting AR as the tortoise that will ultimately win the race, given a wave of emerging companies that are touting enterprise applications, and broadening the opportunities for business growth. To become more widely adopted, AR displays must be small, comfortable and easy to use, while offering superior graphics and an authentic visual experience. To enable these, the display industry is focusing on several key areas, including reduced form factors while maintaining image quality and contrast. Also, the display must enable the wearer to experience excellent image tracking with very low latency during user movement.  And then, there's the increasing development in the area of holographic/light fields, which may not require headsets at all.  Speakers and exhibitors at Display Week will showcase what they are doing to address many of these goals—beyond content and the other necessary software and hardware infrastructure needed for these applications. Since displays are a major component contributing to the user experience, SID conducted a survey to ascertain the current experience level and the expectations to help set the agenda for the Market Focus Conference on AR/VR/wearables. With more than 400 responses, the survey and results can be found here. About Display Week 2017 The 54th SID International Symposium, Seminar and Exhibition, or Display Week 2017, will take place May 21-26 at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, Calif.

(GuruFocus) An interim arbitration decision required QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) to refund BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY) $814 million for overpaid royalties. Nearly a year ago, the companies agreed to arbitrate a dispute regarding Qualcomm’s royalty cap and its applicability to BlackBerry payments from certain subscriber unit sales between 2010 and 2015. Qualcomm's Wednesday press release offered an alternative description of the issue: "[W]hether Qualcomm's voluntary per unit royalty cap program applied to BlackBerry's non-refundable prepayments of royalties." See Also: Big Winner Of Intel-Mobileye Deal: Blackberry? The company noted it doesn't agree with the arbitration result but accepts its binding and non-appealable nature. It further stated that the decision doesn't affect license agreements beyond BlackBerry's "unique" contract. Meanwhile, BlackBerry maintained its intent to maintain its partnership with Qualcomm. "BlackBerry and Qualcomm have a longstanding relationship and continue to be valued technology partners," BlackBerry CEO John Chen said in a press release. "We are pleased the arbitration panel ruled in our favor and look forward to collaborating with Qualcomm in security for ASICs and solutions for the automotive industry." The companies had announced the arbitration process April 20, 2016, and held a binding arbitration hearing between Feb. 27 and March 3. The final award, including interest and attorney fees, will be announced after a May 30 hearing. Qualcomm shares were down 0.87 percent in pre-market hours, while Blackberry, whose shares were briefly halted on the news, resumed trading up 15.58 percent.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

There's also a chance Qualcomm could double down on being a dick after the fact, but keep in mind that's almost guaranteed to happen should Qualcomm themselves win. Jeff Beck Didn't read the article because I don't care, but your hero image is top notch. If I send you a picture of my mother-in-law can you add her in at the top?

Now I am creating lots of money from a home office using this job exactly like 20000 dollars month to month or more if likewise you actually want to make money similar to that so therefore follow these particular easy suggestions by looking at this page >>>>> http://gochiurl.com/15d95 elchuby Is that a yes? PVL_93_RU That's a new elaborate spambot. This time it at least doesn't put everything in bold text, but the shady link still gives it away Ryne Hager This is the best job ever. Also yes. Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company? Second: Holy run on sentence Batman! Shouldn't a paragraph contain more than one sentence? I'm just giving you a hard time. Ryne Hager D: My sarcasm probably wasn't apparent, their actions weren't unexpected. I wish we had a sarcasm punctuation mark, kappa. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Oh but there is! http://www.sarcmark.com/ Funem Or just use the old faithful /sarcasm http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2Fsarcasm Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Pff, saying you are being sarcastic is so yesterday. /s Funem I trust your opinion /sarcasm Allen You must not know many Asians, but you can't swap out one asian nationality with another, guys. Cory Wilson Most likely it'll mean nothing for consumers in the end. Mike O First United Airlines, and now this?! Oh man! Mike O I'm glad Qualcomm is voicing secrets and threats... Apple: I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further... Qualcomm: This deal gets worse all the time... Funem Apple will win, then they will patent "patent lawsuits" then take to court anyone who files a patent lawsuit against them claiming they have violated their rights as the patent holder for patent lawsuits. C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

Switch Launches Its Pyramid-Shaped Data Center in Michigan – Besides the fact that it’s probably the only pyramid in the world whose sole purpose is to house internet infrastructure, bold red pipes outside contrast with the pyramid’s grey walls, giving it a futuristic, sci-fi look, while dramatic lighting inside makes it feel like a cross between a modern corporate lobby and a night club. Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle – Coming from the world’s second-largest cloud provider, that kind of announcement should give Intel a lot to think about. As more and more corporate applications are headed for the cloud, the number of servers traditional hardware vendors sell to enterprises is on a gradual decline, while cloud providers are buying more and more processors to support those migrating workloads. Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware – Microsoft — a company whose relationship with open source software has been complicated at best — has emerged as a pioneer in applying the open source software ethos to hardware design.

Virginia Landgrab Continues: Next Amazon Data Center Campus? – A typical single-story data center footprint might cover just 35 percent of the land. The high price of land in Loudoun County may begin to accelerate a trend toward two-story or three-story data center designs, which would help new development compete, since higher floor area ratios help reduce cost per square foot.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Grow Condos, Inc. Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Zallen, Featured in Exclusive Nasdaq MarketSite Interview at Times Square EAGLE POINT, OR – (NewMediaWire) – April 12, 2017 – Grow Condos, Inc. (OTCQB: GRWC), a fully reporting publicly traded company specialized in cannabis industry related „Condo” style real estate and turn-key grow facilities, is pleased to announce that following the Company’s „Smoke on the Water” acquisition, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Zallen was Interviewed at Nasdaq MarketSite at Times Square by Jill Malandrino, Markets Reporter, where he was able to present insight into the Company’s unique position in the industry and corporate vision. The interview can be viewed in its entirety at the NASDAQ site shortly. Mr. Zallen introduced the Company with a brief overview, reflecting on the various segments of the Company, particularly the corporate real estate division, branding services and financial Services. He proceeded to comment on the statistic revealing that 1 in 5 people or approximately 20% of the US population reside in a legal marijuana state, highlighting market potential for the building of a national footprint. Furthermore, he proceeded to share, based on the Company’s recent „Smoke on the Water” acquisition, that management envisions the building out of a growing number of cannabis friendly destinations. Activities would include yoga, massage, spiritual themes, and amenities would include a general store and the leasing of a dispensary on the property. In response to an inquiry regarding the Company’s advancement strategy, Mr. Zallen shed light on his ideas regarding the advantage of growth through acquisition. He stated: „The RV industry is very fragmented; full of mom and pop operators, that are basically trading around 3-5% EBITDA, and we’re basically thinking that we can grow this to about 20% EBITDA plus land value. So we see a very fast way to grow our top line in this industry.” Upon conclusion, in response to Jill’s inquiry regarding his foresight in the political realm and the long-term outlook, he stated: „None of us know what is going to happen with the Trump Administration; that being said, I do think that what’s going on in the industry is that the states that do have legal Marijuana are enjoying the tax benefits from that. I don’t think that they are going to want to see those tax revenues stop. I also think that other states right now are looking at the legal states and thinking that they might want a piece of that pie.” He concluded by eluding to the fact that the analyst projections point to a 50 Billion dollar industry by 2020, giving the Company the ability to develop a substantial national footprint.

At the time, rumors point to two devices with somewhat different design features. Now, it would seem that Huawei is working on not two, but three MateBook tablets to be unveiled next June at Computex. According to known leakster Evan Blass, Huawei is currently working on three different MateBook tablets dubbed as Pascal, Bell, and Watt. Although somewhat unclear, these MateBook tablets will carry model designations as MateBook E, X, and D. Out of the three, two MateBooks look more like a laptop while the E model has a truer tablet form. Pascal + Bell + Watt = Matebooks E, X, & D (/not/ respectively). RT @rquandt (Huawei MateBook “Pascal”…) https://t.co/beQlSjIDk9 pic.twitter.com/CgXz5AIeMH — Evan Blass (@evleaks) April 11, 2017 Last week, another leakster posted that the Huawei Pascal made its way to Geekbench. Roland Quandt was good enough to post the benchmark results for the said tablet. And from what it looks like, the device in question is pretty decent. Garnering a single-core score of 3651 and multi-core score 6788, this tablet sure is a performer. The Geekbench result also highlighted a few details about the tablet. For one, the processor used is a dual-core Intel i5-7200U running at 2.7GHz with multi-threading enabled. The mid-performance chip is then paired with copious amount of RAM; 8GB. As usual, the system is running Windows 10.

Microsoft is already rumored not to include a Thunderbolt 3 on the upcoming Surface Pro 5. By providing the said port, users will be able to maximize the use of the tablet by connecting an external display or an eGPU. Rumor has it that Huawei intends to unveil the said tablets in the next couple of months. The launch event will coincide with this year’s Computex event in Taiwan. Unfortunately, the leaks did not mention any pricing for each MateBook model. For more updates on the Huawei MateBook, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Microsoft's May Event Could Focus On Windows 10 Cloud Posted: Apr 12 2017, 5:12am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Technology News     Windows 10 Cloud tipped for cheap devices that compete with Chromebooks We know that Microsoft has a spring hardware event planned and the assumption was that at the event we might see a new Surface Pro 5 unveiled. Rumors suggest that tablet will have a mild update to include new hardware like Intel Kaby Lake processors, but not much else. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 A new rumor is making the rounds today that suggests that the spring event might in fact focus more on a new version of Windows 10 than hardware. The new Windows version is called Windows 10 Cloud according to The Verge. Rumors about Windows 10 Cloud first surfaced back in January when early copies turned up. The OS is a simplified version of Windows 10 that will run Universal apps from the Windows Store. Cloud is expected to be a low cost Windows flavor and to compete with Chrome OS. Word is that Cloud might even be free, Microsoft could potentially make money back off app sales. A free or very low cost flavor of Windows could allow notebook and tablet makers to build devices at a low enough cost to compete directly against the Chromebooks that have become popular. Rumors still claim that a new Surface tablet would be unveiled at the event, but there is no clear indication if it will be the Surface Pro 5. My money says that if the event will focus significantly on Windows 10 Cloud, the hardware unveiled at the event would have to be meant to run that operating system, which would mean no high-end tablets.

April 12, 2017 05:00 ET Grow Condos, Inc. Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Zallen, Featured in Exclusive Nasdaq MarketSite Interview at Times Square EAGLE POINT, OR--(Marketwired - Apr 12, 2017) - Grow Condos, Inc. (OTCQB: GRWC), a fully reporting publicly traded company specialized in cannabis industry related "Condo" style real estate and turn-key grow facilities, is pleased to announce that following the Company's "Smoke on the Water" acquisition, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Wayne Zallen was Interviewed at Nasdaq MarketSite at Times Square by Jill Malandrino, Markets Reporter, where he was able to present insight into the Company's unique position in the industry and corporate vision. The interview can be viewed in its entirety at the NASDAQ site shortly. Mr. Zallen introduced the Company with a brief overview, reflecting on the various segments of the Company, particularly the corporate real estate division, branding services and financial Services. He proceeded to comment on the statistic revealing that 1 in 5 people or approximately 20% of the US population reside in a legal marijuana state, highlighting market potential for the building of a national footprint. Furthermore, he proceeded to share, based on the Company's recent "Smoke on the Water" acquisition, that management envisions the building out of a growing number of cannabis friendly destinations. Activities would include yoga, massage, spiritual themes, and amenities would include a general store and the leasing of a dispensary on the property. In response to an inquiry regarding the Company's advancement strategy, Mr. Zallen shed light on his ideas regarding the advantage of growth through acquisition. He stated: "The RV industry is very fragmented; full of mom and pop operators, that are basically trading around 3-5% EBITDA, and we're basically thinking that we can grow this to about 20% EBITDA plus land value. So we see a very fast way to grow our top line in this industry." Upon conclusion, in response to Jill's inquiry regarding his foresight in the political realm and the long-term outlook, he stated: "None of us know what is going to happen with the Trump Administration; that being said, I do think that what's going on in the industry is that the states that do have legal Marijuana are enjoying the tax benefits from that. I don't think that they are going to want to see those tax revenues stop. I also think that other states right now are looking at the legal states and thinking that they might want a piece of that pie." He concluded by eluding to the fact that the analyst projections point to a 50 Billion dollar industry by 2020, giving the Company the ability to develop a substantial national footprint.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT COMPANIES Why Dublin is the digital hub of Europe by John Kennedy 3 hours ago8 Shares Image: Ingus Kruklitis/Shutterstock New infographic emphasises Dublin’s digital credentials on an epic scale. IDA Ireland’s latest infographic ‘Dublin – A Technology Hub’ is a timely reminder of why the capital city of Ireland is a bastion of the European tech scene. It is one in a series of infographics that IDA Ireland has been producing lately, focusing on themes such as competitiveness and why Ireland is a good place to invest. With a design layout that is reminiscent of Waze, the mapping app bought by Google, the infographic paints a geographic picture of the tech scene in Dublin. Maps, apps and legends At its western limits in Leixlip (just slightly over the county border in Kildare, ahem) is Intel, while west Dublin has a concentration of tech players including IBM, Symantec, eBay, Xilinx, Adobe, SAP and Tech Mahindra. To the very north of the city are companies such as Siemens and Fujitsu, while the south plays host to Huawei, Microsoft, Dell, Sage and Vodafone. Right in the centre is where all the activity is concentrated, with players including Wrike, Qualtrics, Salesforce and Slack redefining business software; Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn building social media powerhouses; and Google dominating the largest private sector employer in Dublin, with more than 6,000 people. Born-on-the-web newcomers such as Twilio, HubSpot, Squarespace and Airbnb feature prominently in the city. The e-commerce picture is complemented nicely by Nitro, Jet, Zalando, Amazon, Gilt and Groupon. Meanwhile, the internet of things age is thriving in Dublin thanks to companies such as Daqri, Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson and Accenture, to name a few.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company?

Apple: I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further... Qualcomm: This deal gets worse all the time... Funem Apple will win, then they will patent "patent lawsuits" then take to court anyone who files a patent lawsuit against them claiming they have violated their rights as the patent holder for patent lawsuits. C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

As for its next-generation ZX-E 8 series, Zhaoxin will work with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) using the foundry's 16nm process with mass production scheduled for 2018, said Fu. Zhaoxin is dedicated to developing x86 CPUs, and will be working closely with its foundry partners to enhance its competitiveness, Fu indicated. Zhaoxin is aware that a great combination between product design and manufacturing is key to success in the CPU field, Fu said. Intel makes its own processors in-house setting a good example for how an IDM implements effectively its integrated design and manufacturing. And despite becoming fabless, AMD has Globalfoundries, its former manufacturing arm, offer 14nm and other advanced-node process platforms to be closely integrated with the CPU vendor's design capability, Fu identified. Zhaoxin is committed to developing China's homegrown processors, which will require support from its manufacturing partners, Fu noted. The company is looking to cooperate with leading foundries such as TSMC, which provides advanced-node technologies for high-performance and low-power processors and other chip solutions, Fu said. Zhaoxin is still lagging far behind its international peers, but the company has been making steady progress in its own development, Fu said. Zhaoxin's CPUs have attracted orders from PC vendors such as Lenovo. Nevertheless, Zhaoxin still has a long way to go to catch up with international CPU vendors, Fu admitted. In addition, Zhaoxin recently secured a US$37.31 million cash injection from VIA Technologies, Fu disclosed. The new funds will be utilized for the development of Zhaoxin's next-generation CPU products. Founded in April 2013, Zhaoxin is jointly owned by VIA Technologies and the Shanghai Municipal Government.

(Image for representation, Source: Bloomberg) Qualcomm Inc.’s countersuit against Apple Inc. threatens a relationship that helped both companies rake in billions of dollars as leaders of the smartphone revolution.The acrimony in Apple’s suit and Qualcomm’s response late Monday raises the prospect of Qualcomm losing a big portion of the revenue it gets from one of its biggest customers. For Apple, it suggests doubt about the iPhone’s ability to remain a prestige product without the chipmaker’s wireless technology. “The war between the companies appears to be growing,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. Apple says Qualcomm uses market dominance to illegally overcharge for its wireless technology while Qualcomm argues the iPhone maker is just trying to pay less. The dispute is already threatening Qualcomm’s earnings because contract manufacturers that make the iPhone and pay Qualcomm on behalf of Apple are holding back payments, Rasgon noted. Qualcomm fell 2.1 percent, the most in more than two months, to $55.35 in New York. That extended Qualcomm’s loss of market value to almost $14 billion since Apple filed its complaint Jan. 20. While Apple has surged in the period on optimism about new iPhones coming later this year, the stock slipped 1.1 percent to $141.63 on Tuesday. While the iPhone was taking the world by storm, the partnership served both well. Qualcomm revenue reached $24 billion last year, from $15 billion when it first began supplying chips to Apple in 2011. In that year, iPhones generated $46 billion in sales for Apple. That soared to $137 billion by Apple’s latest fiscal year. But in 2016, iPhone unit shipments dropped for the first time, making the company focus more on profitability, not just growth. Apple pressured suppliers more to save money, and its battle with Qualcomm is the toughest of these tense negotiations. The two companies accuse each other of lying, bullying and other allegedly illegal practices. Underpinning it all is a dispute over licensing fees that make Qualcomm one of the world’s most profitable chipmakers and shave a few percentage points off Apple’s iPhone margins. Also Read: Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm “Apple has built the most profitable company in the world, relying heavily on Qualcomm’s patented technologies,” Qualcomm wrote in Monday’s court filing. “Apple achieved its success without contributing much, if anything, to the innovations at the heart of cellular communications.” Apple says Qualcomm is abusing its strength as the major provider of smartphone chips and related patents to suppress competition and extract billions of dollars in licensing fees it doesn’t deserve. While Apple usually taps multiple suppliers or makes components itself, the modem — a chip that performs the crucial function of connecting a phone to the network and the internet — is Qualcomm’s preserve. Until 2016, Apple had used the San Diego, California-based company’s parts exclusively for several years. Becoming reliant on Apple has been a tough lesson for some companies. Dialog Semiconductor Plc’s shares fell the most in more than 16 years on Tuesday after an analyst warned Apple will cut back on the use of the company’s power-management chips. Earlier this month, Imagination Technologies Group Plc shares plunged as much as 69 percent after the U.K. chip designer said Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. When Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy phones became the main rival of the iPhone, Apple switched manufacturing of its processors from Samsung to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

When Apple put the iPhone 7 on sale last year it tried to muzzle its main modem supplier, according Qualcomm’s filing made late Monday. The reason: some versions of the flagship smartphone weren’t using Qualcomm modem chips. Apple worried that comparisons between Qualcomm iPhones and ones using Intel Corp. modems would cause problems. Apple told Qualcomm to avoid public bake offs between the two flavors of the phone, threatened to use its marketing muscle to attack Qualcomm, and warned that its status as a supplier would be in doubt, according to Monday’s filing. In November, Bloomberg News reported that Apple’s decision to use different modems for the iPhone 7 caused the Intel version of the device to perform worse than the Qualcomm model. Apple said at the time there was “no discernible difference” in the wireless performance of any models. Qualcomm, which owns patents that cover the fundamentals of modern mobile technology, charges phone makers a slice of the selling price of handsets, regardless of whether they use its chips or not. Apple whispered in the ear of regulators around the world, accusing it of misusing this powerful market position, Qualcomm said in its Monday suit. That resulted in antitrust cases, from South Korea to the US, that threaten to curtail this licensing business. According to Apple’s own suit, filed in December, it’s owed billions of dollars it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. On Tuesday, an Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond earlier statements on the suit. Also Read: Qualcomm claims Apple made threats and lied to regulators Qualcomm sees the fight as a commercial negotiation over licensing fees, but on legal steroids. It still thinks that there’s another way, if Apple acknowledges the role of its technology and pays up. “The second way things like this are resolved is through discussions and business resolutions,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in an interview. “We’d prefer not to have disputes.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Apple Qualcomm No Comments.

The same people who accepted and embraced Windows XP for a longer time, have waved goodbye to Vista after disliking most of its features. Though it was launched six years ago, it failed miserably in both retaining as well as attracting new users. Finally, Microsoft is removing the support for this least popular version of their Operating System. Yes, You heard it right. If you are still stuck in Vista, then it's time to move on immediately. It took almost a decade for the company to come up with this announcement. Also Read: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 likely to use Intel Kaby Lake processor From today, Microsoft won't provide any support regarding technical issues of Vista or does not send you any security patch and bug fix updates. It is not a surprise for Windows user since they were expecting it to happen one or the other day. If you still have no plans of moving out of this OS, then you should stay alert for future hacks. Since attackers normally eye on vulnerable PCs which are not upgraded to latest versions or have not updated any security patch. Upgrading prevents you from such attacks and also helps you to keep up with the current technology trends. Microsoft says, " The time has come for us, along with our hardware and software partners, to invest our resources towards more recent technologies." Also Read: Android stands out as a World's Most Popular OS by surpassing Windows Though Vista is used by very less number of users, it won't create much of a problem for the users. Currently, Windows 7 is said to be the most popular operating system globally. It is used on almost half of all the PCs out there.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents.

Qatar Projects developed by the brightest young scientific minds from schools across Qatar have been placed in the spotlight through a new national competition organized by Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of Qatar Foundation Research and Development (QF R&D), and the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. 2,127 students – 31 percent of whom were Qatari - from 130 schools presented the outcomes of their scientific inquiry and innovative thinking to expert judges at the National Scientific Research Competition (NSRC), which took place recently at the Qatar National Convention Centre (QNCC), with the six winners of its Grand Awards now preparing to represent Qatar on science’s global stage. The competition was held as part of the Education Conference and National Scientific Research Week, organized jointly by the Ministry and QNRF under the theme, ‘Pioneering and Creativity’, and attended by His Excellency Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the State of Qatar; His Excellency Dr Mohammed Abdul Wahed Al-Hammadi, Minister of Education and Higher Education; His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Minister of Energy and Industry; and other dignitaries. NSRC aims to enable and inspire students to develop the skills required for scientific discovery and success from a young age, nurture creativity and critical thinking, and enhance Qatar’s human capacity in the field of science and research. It was formed through merging QF R&D’s Qatar Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math Fair (Qatar STEAM); QNRF’s Secondary School Research Experience Program, and the Ministry’s Scientific Research Competition. By amalgamating these three initiatives, preparatory and secondary school students throughout Qatar have been further encouraged to sharpen their focus on scientific exploration that can contribute to addressing Qatar’s national priorities, and given a wider platform to showcase their efforts. Dr. Hamad Al-Ibrahim, Executive Vice President, QF R&D, said: “We welcome the fruitful collaboration between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and QNRF to promote a culture of scientific research and discovery in Qatar, and build the capabilities of our students and teachers in this field.” “We still have a long way to travel on our journey toward becoming a sustainable and diversified economy and, amid global competition, we must elevate our efforts to build the human capacity that is capable of developing solutions that address challenges and create multiple benefits. We hope our students continue to embrace innovation through their studies, contribute to the advancement of our nation in the field of science, research, and innovation, and represent Qatar with distinction at international level.” The aspiring scientists’ projects in the fields of computer science and communications systems, biomedicine, animal and plant sciences, math and physics, chemistry and materials, energy, earth and environmental sciences, engineering and behavioral and social sciences were assessed by a 50-strong judging panel comprising experts from government, the education and research sectors, and industry, with key criteria including students’ capacity to demonstrate innovation and sound research skills. The Grand Award winners will now go forward to the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), to be held in Los Angeles in May, as Qatar’s representatives in a competition which will see students from 70 countries participate. “QNRF’s partnership with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education has enabled the development of a national competition that supports our joint vision of spreading a culture of scientific research in all schools across Qatar, allowing our students to build their knowledge and capabilities in this field and develop high-caliber and innovative projects,” said Dr. Abdul Sattar Al-Taie, Executive Director, QNRF. “Our students carry the hopes of this nation, and through the creativity and innovation that is evident in their research projects, they are demonstrating how they are the foundation on which Qatar’s vision will be achieved.” The NSRC Grand Award-winning projects were developed by Thajiba Al Hail and Sharifa Al Muhannadi from Al Khor Independent High School; Ahmad Al Asmar and Fahad Al Mokhlaf from Ibn Taymiyyah Boys Independent Secondary School; Amany Al Rajhy and Abeer Al Harbi from Qatar Secondary Girls School and Al Kawthar Secondary School for Girls respectively; Saleh Al Mahazaa and Abdullah Al Sulaiman from AlShamal Secondary Boys School; Ahmad El Iwa and Khalifa Al Marri from Ahmed bin Mohammed Secondary Independent Boys School; and Sara Al Kaabi from Qatar Al Masrafia High School for Girls. In total, 27 projects were awarded at the closing ceremony for the Education Conference and National Scientific Research Week. Meanwhile, 18 Qatar-based organizations presented NSRC Special Awards to students who undertook research projects in areas relevant to their business. Awarding organizations were Qatar Science & Technology Park, part of QF R&D, QF members Qatar Biobank, Qatar Career Development Center (QCDC), and Qatar Green Building Council (QGBC), QF member Hamad Bin Khalifa University’s Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), and Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), QF partner universities Texas A&M University at Qatar and Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Qatar Genome Programme, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, the National Committee for Traffic Safety; the British Council; the US Embassy in Qatar; Raytheon International; the Al Bairaq Program at Qatar University; and the Childhood Cultural Center.. The Education Conference and National Scientific Research Week also included the winners of the 2nd Qatar National Astronomy Olympiad being awarded. Organized by QEERI’s Fascination Astronomy Program, funded by QNRF, the competition saw 60 teams of students from 33 middle and 27 high schools in Qatar express their passion for science by creating astronomy devices and conducting mathematical calculations.  Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Rate Article: 2.5 Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome   Tweet comment (0) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit EDITOR’S CHOICE 1 - 4 OF 12 UAE National Space Programme launched: Reaching Mars by 2021 First Shia woman on trial over democracy protests in Saudi Arabia Trump on Assad: He is ‘an animal’, ‘truly an evil person’ Free rides for all from Uber on Turkish referendum day Egyptian christians in Minya refuse to hold Easter celebrations Saudi government currently funding 35,000 women in studies abroad Lebanese journalist Maria Maalouf charged with inciting sedition Turquoise Mountain artists reviving traditional arts in Afghanistan Death sentence for Indian Navy officer accused of espionage in Pakistan Different kind of dinner plans: Trump aide sketches Libya partition plot on napkin Iraqi Christians celebrate first Palm Sunday since they got their town back from Daesh Tremendous sandstorm in Iran reveals ancient historical site!

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Computers iMac 2017 Updates: Configuration, Storage, VR & More; Here’s What We Know So Far By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 12, 2017 12:26 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Kiko Antonio | Last week, an Apple executive did a roundtable meeting with a number of tech journalists to discuss about its products. Apart from admitting the fact that the company dropped the ball on the Mac Pro, the group went on an said that the company still has great plans for the Mac. In fact, it seems like Apple will be starting with the supposed great plan this year with the release of the iMac 2017. Many Mac fans were a bit distraught last year when Apple failed to release an update to the famous all-in-one computer. At the time, Microsoft just released the Surface Studio and everyone was amazed at the capabilities of the desktop computer, albeit still limited. Somehow, Apple aficionados imagined that the company will be releasing something akin to the Surface Studio. The reality is, it would be very much far from it. iMac 2017 design Anyone expecting to see something excitingly different from the iMac 2017 design should just go ahead and stop right now. Since the release of the tapered-edge iMac back in 2012, nothing much has changed in terms of aesthetics. Sure, Apple managed to redesign the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse and made them rechargeable but apart from that, it is still the same design. 2015 iMac Retina (via apple.com) Not that there is nothing good about it, but the only possible design change for now is the removal of the thick bezel at the bottom part of the display. Apart from that, Apple might also reduce the size of the bezels; something akin to the rumored micro-bezeled iPad Pro 2. Since Apple is not a big fan of touch or pen-enabled displays on desktops nor laptops, there is a high chance that the current display stand will not change at all. There is absolutely no reason for Apple to redesign the aluminum stand if it will not feature pen support on the display. One obscure possibility is for Apple to introduce a new color for the iMac 2017. Perhaps  a Space Gray variant will get everyone to notice the desktop once again and make it seem more interesting. Performance and hardware configuration According to the Daring Fireball article, Apple is currently working on the iMac 2017 right now. Furthermore, the company has envisioned the new desktop to cater for mostly pro users as a response to its demographics. Unfortunately, nothing much was given in terms of how much of an improvement will be given to the iMac 2017. A recent blog post from Pike’s Universum claims that the iMac 2017 will finally have a server-grade processor. In fact, the post went on and said the Apple is considering the Intel Xeon E5 1200 V6 family of processors. While this may sound very exciting, it should be noted that not all server-grade processors are better than a consumer-grade processor. In some cases, a quad-core overclocked desktop processor can go head-to-head or even perform better than a server processor. Of course, this will depend on what kind of application one is running on a system. iMac vs Surface Studio (via actualapple.com) Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the the server-grade processor on an iMac 2017 is for the best, it also means that the desktop will finally support ECC-type RAM modules. ECC-type RAMs are far superior than regular desktop RAMs due to in-built error correction protocol. Apart from switching to ECC-type RAM, the iMac 2017 is also said to have a minimum of 16GB of RAM. New NVMe storage Another major selling point for any Mac is the storage. Instead of using common off-the-shelf solid-state drives of SSDs, Apple uses a proprietary NVMe storage. In comparison to a standard SSD, NVMes, especially the ones from Apple, are extremely fast. Apple has invested a lot of time and effort in developing its own storage for the Mac. That being said, the iMac 2017 would feature the latest NVMe storage from Apple. And rumour has it that the biggest storage configuration has been pushed to 2TB. New graphics and VR support As for graphics, since virtual reality or VR is becoming bigger and bigger every year, Apple will also take a slice of that cake. According to the same blog post mentioned earlier, the iMac 2017 will finally support VR with the use of AMD Radeon GPUs. Now, since this is Apple we are talking about, there is actually no point at all to dream really big in terms of graphics. This is mainly because Apple is quite strict in keeping its power target in check. There is absolutely no point in hoping for a Vega 10 GPU on the iMac 2017. The best Apple could probably do is an AMD Radeon R9 395X which has a TDP similar to the M version of the same GPU line. An AMD Radeon RX 480 will be totally out of the question since in TDP alone, the graphics cards runs at 150W. On a good note, the graphics card mentioned earlier is capable of VR gaming as well as gaming on high settings. iMac 2017 accessories Although not entirely what one can call news, but it is possible that the iMac 2017 could feature a revamped Magic Keyboard. The said piece of hardware is rumoured to be almost the same as the current MacBook Pro. It will also have support for Touch Bar and Touch ID. Since the Touch Bar and Touch ID were first introduced on the MacBook Pro, many Mac fans started to fantasize the Magic Keyboard having the same functionality. Rendered images of the keyboard even surfaced on the Internet mere weeks after the MacBook Pro came out. Touch Bar Magic Keyboard render by Bas van der Ploeg (via twitter.com) The one thing that made it more of a possibility is the fact that Apple was already granted a patent for the Touch Bar and Touch ID features on the Magic Keyboard. So, it could be that Apple will turn the patent into reality much sooner than expected. Or course, the iMac 2017 will not be complete without new ports. While Apple is already pushing for the USB Type-C interface, it is still possible that the desktop will retain at least a few older USB interfaces. However, the current Thunderbolt 2 will eventually be replaced by Thunderbolt 3. Target release date and price As for the release date, since Apple already said that the iMac 2017 will be released later this year, there is a high likelihood that it will be between September and October. Apple could choose to go all out and launch the new iMac on the same event that it announces the new iPhones. Or it could make a meal out of it and have a separate one weeks after the iPhone launch, which is probably around October. In terms of price, consumers can expect the iMac 2017 to be a bit pricier, especially the top-tier models. A server-grade processor does not come cheap especially if it is coming from Apple. For the entry level, there is a fair chance that it may still start from $1,500 and work its way up for the high-end versions. For more updates on the iMac 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

After earning universal respect within the mobile ecosystem, this successful spec is moving decisively beyond mobile. The MIPI Alliance just last week unveiled MIPI CSI-2 v2.0. The new spec, according to the industry group, can now respond to complex imaging needs of IoT, wearables, AR/VR, drones and automotive systems. We recently caught up with Haran Thanigasalam, Intel senior platform architect and MIPI Alliance Camera Workgroup Chairman via phone, asked him to break it down for us. Below is an excerpt of our conversation. EE Times: Who’s driving the new MIPI CSI-2 v2.0 spec? Haran Thanigasalam: Many original MIPI Alliance members, who were in the mobile business, are now moving into such new fields as IoT and automotive. They’re driving the spec’s evolution. EE Times: What uses are pushing the limits of camera, imaging and vision technologies? Thanigasalam: We are seeing a broader set of vision applications. They include video streaming, image sensors capable of handling multiple data types, and sensor fusion for ADAS. Some of the key features of MIPI CSI-2 v2.0 are very much directed toward what’s now required by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) cars. (Source: MIPI Alliance) Click here for larger image EE Times: Tell us the key new features developed for CSI-2 v2.0, with focus on automotive. Thanigasalam: There are five. But three are of particular importance to automotive. First is the enhancement of High Dynamic Range and Signal to Noise Ratio. EE Times: Give me an example of how such improvements affect automotive.   Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > More Related Links Renesas Opens Autonomy for Cars Robo-Cars Need Relationship Map Israeli's Valens Semi Snags $60 Million in Funding Connecting Cars with (All) Riders Mentor in Robo-Car Race with Mobileye, Nvidia Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Rookie Want more Cristina777   4/12/2017 4:24:22 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Sometimes technology wants more, one of the reasons I'm a fan Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board Most Recent Comments                 4/12/2017 11:02:25 PM DMcCunney @HH Partners: surprising why micron is not placing a good bid here Not to me.  My understanding is that Micron is working on next gen flash with higher memory densities,... 4/12/2017 11:02:25 PM DMcCunney @HH Partners: surprising why micron is not placing a good bid here Not to me.  My understanding is that Micron is working on next gen flash with higher memory densities,... 4/12/2017 10:56:03 PM DMcCunney @jamestate:Why doesn't e.g. Sony want to buy this?

Baked-in security is a vexed question, for good reason: recipe slips can also hard-wire vulnerabilities into a chip. For example, Intel's Security Guard Extensions (SGX) is a favourite target for attack boffins crafting proofs-of-concept against the architecture. Nonetheless, DARPA wants something better than “patch and pray” software security, so on April 21, it's hosting a Proposers Day for its System Security Integrated Through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH – presumably the extra letter is there to avoid getting LucasFilm lawyers' letters). What it wants is “hardware design tools that provide security against hardware vulnerabilities”, for both Department of Defense and commercial systems. They want designers to “limit the permitted hardware to states that are assured to be secure”, without sacrificing performance. Of particular interest in the DARPA program are the seven vulnerability classes known as Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) applicable to hardware but exploitable through software. These are permission/privilege errors, buffer errors, resource management, information leakage, numeric errors, cryptographic errors, and code injection vulnerabilities. Together, DARPA reckons hardware bugs of this type represents 40 per cent of currently known attacks. The program is managed by Linton Salmon of DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office, who in the agency's announcement says software patches to hardware flaws aren't enough. The SSITH program wants to “remove those hardware vulnerabilities in ways that will disarm a large proportion of today’s software attacks.” SSITH is a 39-month program covering “development and demonstration of hardware architectures”; and techniques to measure the security of new hardware designs, including tradeoffs in things like performance, power efficiency, and circuit area. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Vulnerability DARPA More from The Register If you can't beat AI, join it: Boffinry biz baron Elon Musk backs brain-machine interface biz Computers wired into our minds.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company?

Apple: I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further... Qualcomm: This deal gets worse all the time...

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

The dispenser had gold bars and jewellery studded with diamonds and precious stones worth Rs 2.06 crore. A passenger from Tamil Nadu has been apprehended and the role of an airport `insider' is suspected. Sources with the Air Intel ligence Unit (AIU) of the Bengaluru Customs said the officers found the booty while inspecting the airport toilets soon after the arrival of Thai AirAsia flight (FD 137) from Bangkok following a tip-off."During inspection of a diaper disperser in a restroom on Terminal 1, four blocks sealed in carbon sheets and pouch covered in duct tape were found, which had six gold biscuits of 1kg each, 2 gold rods and gold jewellery studded with diamonds and precious stones," said a Customs inves tigating officer. The team immediately examined footages from CCTV cameras in the area and zeroed in on a middle-aged man who was spotted entering the restroom in a suspicious manner. The man, identified as Mohammed Mohideen, a 42-year-old children's goods trader from Tamil Nadu's Ramanathapu ram, was later nabbed near the immigration area. When questioned, he said that he had placed the gold bars and the ornaments inside the diaper dispenser after disembarking from the Thai aircraft, the officer added. AIU sleuths suspect the role of an airport staff as Mohideen tried to flee after placing the smuggled gold, which an accomplice would later collect and hand over to racketeers waiting outside the airport. "We are investigating possible involvement of an airport staffer. Mohideen has claimed he had to hand over the gold to a man outside the airport but hid it in the toilet fearing Customs officials," a senior Customs officer said. The gold bars and jewel lery weighing precisely 6.45kg were seized and Mohideen, who claimed to have travelled to Bangkok a few days ago to buy children's goods for his shop in Tamil Nadu was arrested. He was remanded to judicial custody and sent to jail later on Monday . A probe is under way into the case.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company? Second: Holy run on sentence Batman! Shouldn't a paragraph contain more than one sentence? I'm just giving you a hard time.

Apple: I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further... Qualcomm: This deal gets worse all the time...

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Qualcomm Countersues Apple, Says iPhone Wouldn't Be Possible Without its Technologies Qualcomm Countersues Apple, Says iPhone Wouldn't Be Possible Without its Technologies Tuesday, 11 April 2017 (2 days ago) Qualcomm today announced it has countersued Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, nearly three months after the iPhone maker sued the chipmaker for $1 billion in alleged unpaid royalty rebates. Qualcomm, which earlier called Apple's lawsuit "baseless," accused Apple of failing to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to its 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. The chipmaker accused Apple of breaching its licensing agreements, making false statements, and encouraging regulatory attacks on its business in multiple countries. Qualcomm also said Apple has deliberately "chose not to utilize the full performance" of its LTE modem in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Even still, independent testing last year found Qualcomm's LTE chip to significantly outperform Intel's LTE chip in iPhone 7 models. However, Qualcomm said Apple misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using its modems and those using competitor-supplied modems. Qualcomm said Apple made threats to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm, a longtime supplier of 3G and LTE modems for iPhones, said Apple has "launched a global attack" against its company, using its "enormous market power" to coerce unfair and unreasonable licensing terms. Qualcomm said Apple "could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise" without relying upon Qualcomm's "fundamental cellular technologies," adding that Apple "refuses to acknowledge the well established and continue value of those technologies" after a decade of unprecedented growth. “Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm's patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. “The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” Qualcomm is seeking, among other things, damages from Apple for "reneging on its promises in several agreements" and to "enjoin Apple from further interference" with Qualcomm's agreements with other companies and licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.Tag: Qualcomm Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 1 week ago< > Embed Is Apple Developing iPhone Graphics Chips In House? 00:48 Cnet has reported that Apple is developing its own graphics processors to be used in future versions of products including the iPhone.

X The 95-year-old professor heralding a new type of long-lasting battery A new battery cell prototype may be the best chance tech has at creating faster, safer and longer-lasting rechargeable battery power about an hour ago John Holden Prof John Goodenough (95): ‘I’m old enough to know you can’t close your mind to new ideas’         ‘Game-changer’ is an overused term in tech. But the development of a “low-cost all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle with a high volumetric energy density and fast rates of charge and discharge,” is legitimately worthy of such a hackneyed phrase. What makes this breakthrough (sorry I couldn’t help it) even sweeter is that the research team responsible was led by Prof John Goodenough of the University of Texas in Austin. Now in his 95th year, Goodenough is no stranger to innovation in this field. In 1980, at the tender age of 57, he coinvented the lithium-ion battery, which shrank power into the tiny packages we are still familiar with 60 years on. Since the energy crisis in the 1970s, he has maintained an almost militant devotion to the defeat of pollution, principally caused by humanity’s over-dependence on petroleum and fossil fuels, leading him to focus on green science for most of his career. As the lithium-based storage provider became increasingly seen as dangerous, expensive and inadequate for the growing power needs of new generations, Goodenough searched for a solution through the development of safer, more solid batteries that were both low cost and lightweight. This was no easy task. Then he stumbled upon the work of Portuguese physicist, Maria Helena Braga, who had developed a kind of glass that replaces liquid electrolytes inside batteries. This, it transpired, was the missing part in Goodenough’s thesis. “I’m old enough to know you can’t close your mind to new ideas,” he says. “You have to test out every possibility if you want something new.” After two years of collaboration with Braga, Goodenough outlined the key elements which make their battery design novel. Low-cost alternative In a recent paper published by the journal Energy & Environmental Science, he described its significance in reference to existing electric car innovation: “Cost, safety, energy density, rates of charge and discharge and cycle life are critical for battery-driven cars to be more widely adopted. “We believe our discovery solves many of the problems that are inherent in today’s batteries.” This newest offering – a low-cost, all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle life (battery life) with a high volumetric energy density and fast rates of charge and discharge – was completed in no small part with the contribution of now senior research fellow at UT, Maria Helena Braga. “It is safe, has very high energy density and it’s cheap to make,” she says. “We wanted to make a safe battery with a glass electrolyte and by trying certain approaches we found that we could make a new cell architecture. “It is a prototype but we are very optimistic that it can be commercialised soon. It does not depend on us anymore but on the industries that license.” The research team have demonstrated how their new battery cells have more than three times the energy density of modern lithium-ion batteries. In addition, no root-like dendrites form causing it to short-circuit – one of the biggest flaws of traditional lithium batteries. “No short circuits can take place in our prototype,” says Braga. “The electrolyte is not flammable, therefore no explosions or fires are possible.” The materials required are widely available and inexpensive. Any that aren’t, are cheap to synthesize and environmentally friendly. Tech-Xism Tech is fast becoming on par with the fashion industry for its reputation for ageism. From the 22-year-old Mark Zuckerburg becoming chief executive of Facebook, to the more recent news of 12-year-old inventor Shubham Banerjee securing venture-capital funds from Intel to start his own company, the idea that innovation and youth are joined at the hip isn’t going away. While it may be a fun yarn to spin, it isn’t true. According to an Information Technology and Innovation Foundation study from 2016, inventors “peak in their late 40s and tend to be highly productive in the last half of their careers”. Goodenough’s leading role in this tech innovation is a shining example of this. “I do not respect Prof Goodenough because he is 94 years old,” stresses Braga. “There are numerous other, more important reasons to respect him: his broad understanding of the complex fields of physics and chemistry, how he welcomes new ideas, his mental process during any scientific discussion: how he grabs life.” Most importantly is the practical scientific learning Braga has gained under Goodenough’s tutelage. “He may have taught me valuable life lessons about how we can still be active players in the future, but from a scientific point of view, I have learnt so much about batteries and magnetism.” The two are currently filing several patents and plan to work with commercial battery manufacturers in applying their new power storage approach to electric vehicles and energy storage devices.       Topics: John Goodenough Lin Lin Maria Helena Braga Mark Zuckerburg Innovation Foundation Facebook Intel Read More Ex-Army colleagues target handgun owners with new device Adidas plans to mass-produce 3D-printed runners Connemara seaweed ingredients firm eyes global markets Science breakthrough will let milk cartons send text messages Cork-based firm tackling the data deluge – with DNA If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Cork-based firm set to shake up global iron supplements market Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools Axial3D secures £230,000 of new investment in seed funding Music industry starts to dance to streaming giant Spotify’s tune  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services Permanent TSB plans to resume dividend payments to investors Technology Ikea’s next target?

Elaine Ou Google would be unhappy about losing ground to competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. Photo: Bloomberg Uber is currently in trouble for, well, a lot of things, but one particularly problematic thing is the claim that the ride-hailing company acquired trade secrets stolen from Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. It’s also a case where Uber isn’t the one behaving badly. According to a lawsuit filed by Waymo, employees swiped files describing proprietary self-driving technology just before leaving to start a competing company. The start-up, Otto, existed for all of seven months before it was acquired by Uber Technologies Inc. During this time, Google’s car project experienced a larger employee exodus, with many key players leaving to start or join new companies. So whatever happens, it’s looking like Google has already lost the battle. Silicon Valley’s most valuable assets are its people, not its intellectual property. In the pharmaceutical industry, businesses revolve around patent licensing because it’s expensive and time-consuming to take a drug to market. For technology companies, the opposite is true—the industry evolves so quickly that today’s valuable property could be obsolete by tomorrow. Resources are better invested in developing new ideas than protecting old ones. Litigation is generally seen as the domain of ailing dinosaurs—Oracle Corp. has been suing Google for the last seven years over the use of Java, a programming language developed in the 1990s. There’s an argument to be made that protecting intellectual property encourages investment in new technology, but it was liberation from those protections that created Silicon Valley in the first place. In 1951, a patent for the semiconductor transistor was awarded to William Shockley and assigned to AT&T Bell Labs. As part of a 1956 antitrust settlement, AT&T agreed to provide royalty-free licensing on all its patents. Shockley promptly moved to Mountain View, California, where he founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories and recruited some of the earliest engineering talent to the valley. Two years later, eight of Shockley’s employees left to start a competing company called Fairchild Semiconductor. The traitorous eight then saw their own employees leave to found other semiconductor businesses, including Intel, AMD, Intersil and National Semiconductor. This type of procreation still happens today. For many years, Google had a company-wide policy of allowing employees one day per week to work on side projects. Google makes a point of telling new hires that the company doesn’t sue former employees for patent infringement. Its employees have gone on to start Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest. The ex-Googlers, or Xooglers, even have their own investment community and Demo Day. As a Google recruiter put it to me once, Google’s appeal isn’t the job that you have while working at Google, it’s the job you can get after you leave Google. Some of today’s popular tech companies have a median employment tenure of less than three years. Anywhere else, this type of turnover might be seen as a horrible failing. Here, it’s what keeps companies innovative. Ideas flow to where they’re treated best, even if that happens to be the hands of a competing startup. Otto wasn’t the only self-driving car company founded by former members of the Google car team. Two top engineers left to start Nuro.ai; the hardware lead received a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. for Argo AI; and Chris Urmson, former head of the Google Car project, has his own self-driving company called Aurora Innovation. It’s understandable that Google would be unhappy about losing ground to the competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. A few years ago, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk made the company’s intellectual property available for free use. He explained that Tesla’s real competition wasn’t the other electric car manufacturers, but industry inertia. For Tesla to be successful, the sustainable transportation movement had to be successful. Self-driving cars require a similar paradigm shift, which is something Waymo can’t achieve alone. It should welcome the competition.

"The truth is, what's happening here has much less to do with the semiconductor business than it does with the ... actual business of money management — the perception of what's a bargain versus what's expensive in a portfolio manager's eyes," the "Mad Money" host said. AMD and Nvidia both make graphic chips for gaming and have growing exposure to data centers. AMD also supplies the personal computer and virtual reality businesses, while Nvidia has ties with the connected car and artificial intelligence. Both of the companies stock's have also soared. AMD has shot up 362 percent in a year, while Nvidia has seen a 171 percent gain. But AMD slid over 16 percent from its February highs, and Nvidia is down over 18 percent since then. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer investigates why AMD and NVDA's stocks just got rattled    8 Hours Ago | 09:36 "If there's one thing money managers hate more than flat-out losing money on an investment, it's giving up tremendous gains," Cramer said. "After the amazing moves in Nvidia and AMD, you have to believe there were a ton of institutional investors out there who were looking for any excuse whatsoever to ring the register and take some profits." So when a number of analysts suggested investors should sell Nvidia and Goldman Sachs slapped a "sell" rating on AMD, the stocks became hard to own and funds shed their shares. Cramer also nodded to the rebounding popularity of cellphone-oriented chipmakers that were all but irrelevant on Wall Street until Apple began to regain its momentum. "It's live by Apple, die by Apple," Cramer said. "Lately, ... names like Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Micron — although much less lately — and Broadcom have come back into vogue, and all of these stocks remain way, way cheaper than Nvidia and AMD." If you are nervous about owning Nvidia or AMD despite nothing being wrong with the companies themselves, Cramer suggests picking up a diversified name like Broadcom. "I still like Broadcom, which I think has a lot more upside," Cramer said, adding that the company will soon complete its $6 billion acquisition of Brocade and has a good record of making deals. He also suggested going for Intel, which has an inexpensive stock and just made a promising deal with Mobileye that puts it front and center in the self-driving vehicle space. Or buy up the semiconductor equipment plays like Lam Research and KLA-Tencor, which are less susceptible to the market's moodiness and whose products are in steady demand. "You have to recognize that these two winners are suffering from severe profit-taking, and that's driving cash toward cheaper stocks," Cramer concluded. "[AMD and Nvidia are] doing great, but portfolio managers want to play the Apple cycle right now, provided Apple doesn't crush its suppliers, and they're using the proceeds from their big wins in AMD and Nvidia to do just that."

Here’s why the US controls oil prices Elizabeth Gurdus | @elizabethgurdus 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Cramer Remix: Forget OPEC! Here’s why the US controls oil prices    7 Hours Ago | 01:29 As oil prices teeter at $53 a barrel, Jim Cramer drilled down on how investors should play what looks like a temporary ceiling for crude due to a growing glut of U.S. oil. The Permian Basin, stretching across western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, has been a hot spot for U.S. drillers, particularly since a group of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers agreed to production cuts in November. Those output cuts now look like they may be extended, perhaps in an effort to curb oil's decline, but U.S. producers are instead taking advantage. "OPEC's discipline means nothing in the face of the huge production increases coming from America — 100,000 new barrels every single month — thanks to terrific technology that makes it much easier and cheaper to pull oil out of the ground," the "Mad Money" host said. Brad Quick | CNBC An oil worker stands by a rig near Williston, North Dakota. Cramer also looked into cancer and immunotherapy play Incyte, a bitoech that has been soaring of late and is capitalizing on one of the hottest areas of the drug business. The company recently filed an offering to sell over 34 million of its shares, which Cramer said could provide an opening for a well-priced buy. And the company has been the subject of numerous takeover rumors, and while Cramer never recommends a stock on takeover speculation, he said an acquisition would be "icing on the cake" and could drive the $138 stock up to $200. "I bet this baby's got more room to run," the "Mad Money" host said. "Ideally you buy a little now – I wish it had been down today – and then wait for that secondary offering to price just in case the stock pulls back and it gives you a better entry point." Another company that looks like it has much more room to run is the far-reaching International Flavors & Fragrances. Cramer spoke with the CEO, Andreas Fibig, for his take on how consumers' tastes are evolving. IFF's business hinges on science and innovation, developing everything from drink flavors to scents for fabric softeners to perfumes. The company has acquired five others in the past two years, a move Fibig said will build growth. It also puts IFF in the lucrative businesses of skincare, hair care, and other cosmetics all made from natural ingredients, which Fibig has noticed consumers have started to prioritize. The company even has a patent on technology that draws 100 percent natural, sustainable ingredients from various waste streams. "That's the reason why we went into that kind of technology," the CEO said. "What everybody wants now in the U.S. ... is a clean label, so not too many chemicals on the label. And that's something which helps us to facilitate that market trend." Chris Stowers | Bloomberg | Getty Images The semiconductor business has been a hot 2017 play, but the segment's leaders, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, have been getting hammered, so Cramer took to finding out what is causing their pullback. "The truth is, what's happening here has much less to do with the semiconductor business than it does with the ... actual business of money management — the perception of what's a bargain versus what's expensive in a portfolio manager's eyes," the "Mad Money" host said. So while Cramer insisted there is nothing wrong with either company, if you are nervous about owning them, he suggested buying a diversified name like Broadcom, an inexpensive stock like Intel with its promising Mobileye partnership, or one of the semiconductor suppliers. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk past the New York Stock Exchange. Finally, for Cramer, Thursday's big bank earnings reports could not be more important to this ailing market. Bank stocks exploded after the election, but since March, weak employment numbers and the GOP's health care defeat dragged the big banks' shares down. So with the market slumping from stalling in Washington, foreign policy tensions, expensive stocks, and more, this inflection point needs a resolution, whether it comes in the form of strong earnings reports from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup or progress in Washington. "For the moment, we're at a level where things need to go very right for stocks to move higher, and those long odds make for a, yes, suboptimal start to earnings season," Cramer said. In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks: SemGroup: "It's a good company. It's a good company. It fits the profile and it's a good company. It does a lot of gas liquids, it's a very good company. I've got a good call." AMC Networks: "Yeah, you know, it's at kind of an interesting level, and it's good. And these content companies became king again. I like your choice." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Scores Higher Global Mac Sales Amid Broad PC Declines Apple Inc. Loses Top Smartphone Vendor Crown to Samsung (AAPL) Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Is Countersuing Apple Inc. (AAPL) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) started off 2017 by launching a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). AAPL accused QCOM of forcing it to pay inflated royalties and withholding payments after AAPL cooperated with regulators investigating Qualcomm. QCOM stock dropped 12% after the suit was filed and has yet to recover. Now the Apple modem supplier is fighting back. Source: Apple The next move in this battle is Qualcomm suing Apple, citing, “Apple’s efforts to devalue the fundamental Qualcomm technologies empowering the iPhone.” The Apple Lawsuit Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against QCOM on Jan. 20. The legal action centered around the royalties paid for the Qualcomm modem that has been exclusively powering cellular connectivity for every iPhone — except the iPhone 7 (more on that shortly). The Apple lawsuit accuses the company of overcharging on royalties covering standard essential patents. It also claims QCOM was double-charging on the Qualcomm modem used in the iPhone, forcing Apple to pay for the component, and then pay a second time in the form of a separate licensing fee. AAPL says QCOM was pressuring carriers to refuse to sell iPhones if they were equipped with a modem made by rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), after Apple announced that for the first time, Intel would replace QCOM as the modem supplier for some of its iPhone 7 smartphones. It also accused the company of collecting royalties for features it had no involvement with, including TouchID fingerprint readers. Finally, AAPL accused QCOM of withholding roughly $1 billion in rebates after Apple cooperated with South Korean antitrust regulators investigating QCOM. Retaliation: Qualcomm Suing Apple QCOM filed its answers and counterclaims to the Apple lawsuit on April 10. Qualcomm suing Apple is now part of the legal entanglement as QCOM seeks financial damages from the company. In its claim QCOM states: “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm.” QCOM is not just defending against the Apple lawsuit, it’s going on the offensive.

Here's why By Shelley Singh , ET Bureau | Apr 13, 2017, 06.31 AM IST Post a Comment Technology could make Aadhaar vulnerable. It needs to be further strengthened as devices can be compromised to extract biometrics if the target is high value. As far as identification technology for citizens goes, nothing in the world rivals or even comes close to Aadhaar. The biometric-based (fingerprints and iris scans) 12-digit unique identity, now used by almost 1.1 billion Indians, is the most advanced of its kind. Jaijit Bhattacharya, partner, strategy and economics, KPMG India says, "India is at least a decade ahead of any other country in terms of using biometrics as an identity." The US and other countries use biometrics at immigration. Australia and Canada use biometric-based checks for border control. Israel also has Aadhaar-like biometric database of all Israeli residents. However, "no country is using biometricbased systems in as wide range of applications as India is envisaging," says Madhur Singhal, partner, Bain & Company. Plagued as India is by the menace of duplicate cards—random estimates suggest many citizens have anywhere from two to five driving licences, ration cards and the like—Aadhaar is the only one that evidently can't be duplicated. And the government is pushing Aadhaar for almost everything—marriage certificates, passports, pension claims, opening bank accounts and now for mobile connections and also to be linked to PAN cards. Neel Ratan, leader, government and public sector, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India, says, "It makes immense sense to use Aadhaar to solve numerous problems in society—like targeting subsidies to right people. Ghost beneficiaries have disappeared with its use." Aadhaar is already being used in multiple places (see graphic). Its biggest benefit is universal and trusted verification of any individual and, as a result, Aadhaar is being used to acquire and authenticate customers faster in businesses like financial services or banking by doing eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer), eSigning of documents and so on. Besides, "the government is linking transfer of subsidies and other benefits through Aadhaar. This ensures transparency. Aadhaar will form the basis for digital storage of documents as well, very soon," says Singhal. Even as the Aadhaar world expands, there have been noises about why it is being made mandatory for multiple government schemes and how secure it is. The Supreme Court has already noted that not having Aadhaar cannot be the basis for denying services. Certain groups have questioned security and raised privacy concerns. Recently, even former cricket captain MS Dhoni's personal details were made public by a private Aadhaar enrolment centre, which has now been banned for 10 years. BIOMETRICS AREN'T IMPREGNABLE Aadhaar looks super hi-tech and impregnable today. But technology itself could make it vulnerable. Aadhaar needs to be further strengthened as devices can be compromised to extract biometrics if the target is high value. Bhattacharya says, "Also, biometrics such as fingerprints have been shown to be compromised by taking a high resolution picture of the fingers and converting it into fingerprint gloves." Be careful when you pose with the victory sign or a thumbs up 'like' sign before cameras. Fears of biometric theft are real and now the Japanese have reportedly started using skin-coloured gloves when being photographed so fingerprints can't be lifted, which is possible via high-resolution photographs taken from a distance of 10 metres or less. Researchers at Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII) were able to copy fingerprints based on photos taken by digital cameras. "Just by casually making a peace sign in front of a camera, fingerprints can become widely available," NII researcher Isao Echizen was quoted in a January 11 post. He added that anyone can easily copy fingerprints. "Similarly, iris scans can be compromised. It's possible to wear silicone implants with someone else fingersprints to access, say bank account, if that's the only mode of access," says Bhattacharya. Adds Pradeep Dubey, Intel Fellow, Intel Labs director, parallel computing lab, "Biometrics has its own unique domain specific algorithms. The new trend is multi-modal— combine multiple forms of biometric features such as fingerprints, voice, iris and gait to improve recognition and resilience." Dubey believes the way out is to combine biometrics with non-biometric identification approaches, like one-time passwords. Some biometric hacking techniques are expensive and futuristic. Ratan feels "security fears are being overplayed." Eventually, though, nothing is 100% secure, particularly any computer-based system. Ratan says, "Aadhaar has the best possible security at present. Criticism comes from people who don't get any benefit from Aadhaar. Ask the poor and those who benefit and it's a different story."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Ernst & Young Announces Big Switch Networks’ Douglas Murray and Kyle Forster as EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2017 Northern California Semifinalists /EINPresswire.com/ — SANTA CLARA, CA–(Marketwired – Apr 12, 2017) – Big Switch Networks, The Next-Generation Data Center Networking Company, today announced Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks, and Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks, were named semifinalists for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2017 Northern California Region Award. Murray and Forster were selected as semifinalists by a panel of independent judges for their respective contributions to and guidance of Big Switch. Prior winners for Northern California include Reid Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, Nick Woodman of GoPro, Andreas Bechtolsheim and Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks and James Park of Fitbit. Under Murray’s guidance, Big Switch has experienced 40+% average QoQ growth for the last 12 quarters. Since he joined the company in late 2013, headcount has doubled and will have tripled by the end of 2017 to support growing market demand for Big Switch’s products. Prior to joining Big Switch, Murray ran Juniper Networks’ Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China organization, where he was responsible for all aspects of Juniper’s business across the region. Previously he held executive positions at Extreme Networks, Sun Microsystems, as well as his first start-up, Sanrise. He started his career at AT&T as an Account Executive and was part of the AT&T Leadership Development Program. Murray has also been a guest lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on the topic of entrepreneurialism. „I am honored to be named an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California semifinalist, and thrilled to be nominated alongside Kyle,” said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. „Kyle is the embodiment of entrepreneurialism and made a huge bet in starting Big Switch with Guido. I’ve never been more proud of the collective work of incredibly smart people, and it is my honor to lead this amazing organization.” Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, the head of Stanford University’s Clean Slate Lab at the time and pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial ‚one big switch’ product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company’s first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors’ expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. „I am thrilled and humbled to be named a semifinalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful,” said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. „Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch’s success.” Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by a customer count that more than doubled in 2016 and a rapidly expanding geographical footprint. In Q4 2016 Big Switch established a dedicated presence in EMEA region and in Q3 2016 into China and ANZ regions. In the latest quarter, the company saw more than 100 transactions across 50 of its customers and has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, in verticals that include: technology, financial services, government, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from venture capital firms including: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more. In 2017 Big Switch was named for the third consecutive year to JMP Securities Super 60 List as well as to CRN’s 2017 SDDC 50 and Data Center 100 lists. Big Switch has also been certified a Great Place to Work from the GPTW Institute, with the company receiving a 93% overall employee satisfaction rating.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News John McAfee Provides Update on MGT Sentinel DURHAM, N.C., April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI) today provided an update on MGT Sentinel, an intrusion monitoring platform designed to protect corporate and enterprise intranets from sophisticated hacking threats. John McAfee, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MGT, explained, „When I joined MGT, my stated mission was to deliver the next generation of cybersecurity technology to the marketplace. Sentinel was acquired because the principles and technology foundation nearly exactly match the needs of enterprise clients in today’s IT environment. By building onto this base hardware, we had hoped to jumpstart normal timelines and deliver a world class product at the end of last year. During its limited initial release, we challenged the best hackers in the world to exploit MGT Sentinel. Unfortunately, the product proved vulnerable on both the server and sensor side, and was not foolproof as I had promised. „The Company also was also hampered by corporate events that limited its access to capital and prevented it from quickly ramping up its tech team, particularly in light of the termination of our planned merger agreement. We have since restructured our technical team and engaged Chris Roberts, the world-renowned cybersecurity expert, to replace our former interim Chief Technology Officer. Under the lead direction of Chris, Sentinel has completed a redesign and all issues uncovered by our hacker testing have been addressed.” Mr. Roberts stated, „Sentinel has been re-engineered with a greater understanding of the latest exploits. We know how the attackers work, so Sentinel has been enhanced to blend seamlessly within its environment by maintaining the appropriate port and service configurations. Sentinel’s advanced capabilities will monitor extraneous traffic to identify legitimate threats within seconds.” Mr. McAfee concluded, „I’m excited to announce that we are now at the stage that I can promise an outstanding product. We expect prototypes in the next several weeks to give us success with a large distribution partner, with sales beginning by the end of this quarter.” The Company also invites shareholders to view a message from Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John McAfee. About MGT Capital Investments, Inc. MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI) is in the process of acquiring and developing a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. With industry pioneer John McAfee at its helm, MGT is positioned to address various cyber threats through advanced protection technologies for mobile and personal technology devices, as well as corporate networks.

(OTC: MGTI) today provided an update on MGT Sentinel, an intrusion monitoring platform designed to protect corporate and enterprise intranets from sophisticated hacking threats. John McAfee, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MGT, explained, "When I joined MGT, my stated mission was to deliver the next generation of cybersecurity technology to the marketplace. Sentinel was acquired because the principles and technology foundation nearly exactly match the needs of enterprise clients in today's IT environment. By building onto this base hardware, we had hoped to jumpstart normal timelines and deliver a world class product at the end of last year. During its limited initial release, we challenged the best hackers in the world to exploit MGT Sentinel. Unfortunately, the product proved vulnerable on both the server and sensor side, and was not foolproof as I had promised. "The Company also was also hampered by corporate events that limited its access to capital and prevented it from quickly ramping up its tech team, particularly in light of the termination of our planned merger agreement. We have since restructured our technical team and engaged Chris Roberts, the world-renowned cybersecurity expert, to replace our former interim Chief Technology Officer. Under the lead direction of Chris, Sentinel has completed a redesign and all issues uncovered by our hacker testing have been addressed." Mr. Roberts stated, "Sentinel has been re-engineered with a greater understanding of the latest exploits. We know how the attackers work, so Sentinel has been enhanced to blend seamlessly within its environment by maintaining the appropriate port and service configurations. Sentinel's advanced capabilities will monitor extraneous traffic to identify legitimate threats within seconds." Mr. McAfee concluded, "I'm excited to announce that we are now at the stage that I can promise an outstanding product. We expect prototypes in the next several weeks to give us success with a large distribution partner, with sales beginning by the end of this quarter." The Company also invites shareholders to view a message from Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John McAfee. About MGT Capital Investments, Inc. MGT Capital Investments, Inc.

A shift to Apple developing its own chips in-house is unlikely in the short term, he said. Dialog stock sank 20 percent to 38.26 euros at 12:05pm in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of 2.98 billion euros (US$3.16 billion). It earlier dropped as much as 36 percent, its biggest intraday decline since Dec. 18, 2000. Apple suppliers have been hit recently. Last week, Apple notified Imagination Technologies Group PLC that it would stop using the British company’s graphics technology within the next two years. The news sent Imagination’s shares down 62 percent on Monday last week, as Apple is Imagination’s largest customer, providing just over half its revenue. Apple also dominates Dialog’s supply chain. Reading, England-based Dialog gets about 74 percent of its sales from Apple. “We believe that Apple is setting up power-management design centers in Munich and California,” Iltgen said. “We hear from the industry that about 80 engineers at Apple are already working on a PMIC [power management IC] with specific plans to employ it in the iPhone by as early as 2019.” Bankhaus Lampe downgraded Dialog to a sell rating from hold. Spokespeople from Dialog and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Dialog, which supplies chips to Apple’s iPhones and iPads, employs about 1,300 engineers, predominately in the UK. Apple has been busy taking in-house development work for its graphic processing units. The Cupertino, California-based company is designing a new chip for future Mac laptops that would take on more of the functionality now handled by Intel Corp processors. Apple already designs its own smartphone processors, obviating the need to turn to Qualcomm Inc or another supplier for chipsets. There has been a steady flow of engineers from Dialog to Apple over the past year, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak on the topic. Due to the close nature of Dialog’s relationship with Apple, it is not unusual to see a steady flow of employees to and from the two companies, the person said. However, over the past year Apple also hired several people from fellow supplier Imagination, including former chief operating officer John Metcalfe as a senior director based in London. Imagination said in its last week statement that Apple “has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products.” Other Apple suppliers were also dragged down by signals of the technology giant’s increasing self-reliance, with sensor makers AMS AG and STMicroelectronics NV declining as much as 10 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. Not everyone agrees that Dialog is at risk. “We do not see them remotely in a similar position,” Barclays PLC analyst Andrew Gardiner said in a research note. “We acknowledge Apple’s continued hiring of engineers, in power management and elsewhere, but an additional 80 engineers hired in this area pales in comparison to the over 1,300 engineers Dialog employed at the end of last year.” This story has been viewed 1739 times.

(AMD) Stock for Profits I want to play AMD stock with bullish intent ... but cautiously By Chris Tyler, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 12, 2017, 11:55 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is a Buy at Last Ride the Micron Technology, Inc.

(AMD) Stock for Profits Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD): Bull, Bear or Beware? 3 Contrarian Solar Stocks to Buy at the Bottom View All Posts Is recent stock weakness in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) offering investors an early warning to make an exit? Or is this a bullish opportunity to buy? Today, we’ll look at the current setup in AMD stock, then present a strategy that will provide profits without piling on the risk. Source: Shutterstock It has been just more than a month since I last penned a mostly optimistic take and strategy on AMD. Shares of Advanced Micro are mostly unchanged for the period, but beneath the surface, there has been a good deal of price volatility to ponder. The most striking catalyst during this period was a surprising initiation from Goldman Sachs. Last week, the firm slapped AMD stock with a “sell” rating and $11 price target roughly 20% below the prior night’s close. The bearish coverage was good enough to send shares more than 6% lower in a single session. Analyst Toshiya Hari did note many improvements at AMD under the stewardship of CEO Lisa Su. In his view, product launches, cost management and deleveraging of the company’s balance sheet have all been well-executed. However, given 2016’s substantial 300%-plus gain and relatively steep multiple, Hari warned strongly that Advanced Micro Devices was also “priced for perfection.” Also, analysts expect that an unfavorable price war with both Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would occur at Advanced Micro’s expense. Is it time to listen to Goldman? One could use it as a starting point. However, Goldman’s calls — beyond their short-term influence — aren’t exactly the gold standard. I’d prefer to look at what others have to say and maintain an open mind. AMD Stock Chart   Click to Enlarge Advanced Micro Devices is far from a momentum play right now — at least in the bullish direction. Stochastics are oversold, and an uptrend line of around six months in duration has been broken. Shares could always snap back aggressively with a bullish earnings reaction. But for now, Goldman’s knockdown of AMD stock essentially pulled the rug out from what had been a nicely-developing momentum situation. Maybe Goldman is, as alum and CNBC personality James Cramer suggests, merely “taking away the punchbowl” for AMD — but a company that remains on track to grow its business and capture market share?

While the update has introduced a number of new features geared towards the creative types, there are also those that will appease the masses, including more battery-friendly internet sessions. Well, depending on exactly which browser you’re using that is. To prove its point, Microsoft has released a battery test video comparison, showing the staying power of the three most popular browsers side-by-side, pitting its own Edge offering against Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox. The test was a simple one, which browser could last the longest while streaming full screen video from Vimeo. Find out how Windows 10 fared in our review Microsoft wins test conducted by Microsoft Given that Microsoft is keen for you to see the results, there’s no prizes for guessing which browser came out on top, yep, Microsoft Edge. Edge didn’t just, well, edge the test either. Instead it dominated proceedings, lasting a full 35% longer than Google Chrome and a massive 77% longer than Firefox. While Firefox lasted just 7 hours and 4 minutes before conking out, Chrome managed a full 9 hours and 17 minutes of streaming. Microsoft’s Edge browser, which has been specially attuned for the new Windows 10 Creators Update, however, just kept on chugging, eventually notching up 12 hours and 31 minutes of streaming time before finally calling it a day. In terms of fairness, the three browsers were each made to run on identical Surface Book machines, each powered by Intel’s 2.4GHz Core i5-6300U processor, 8GB of RAM and Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. Ensuring further parity, each device was muted, had brightness set to 75%, Bluetooth and location disabled and the Quiet Hours functionality switched on. As well as improved Edge performance, the new Windows 10 Creators Update, which is available as a free download now, has added a mass of new features including 3D-friendly Paint, a blue light depleting Night Light mode, and enhanced privacy settings.

Murray and Forster were selected as semifinalists by a panel of independent judges for their respective contributions to and guidance of Big Switch. Prior winners for Northern California include Reid Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, Nick Woodman of GoPro, Andreas Bechtolsheim and Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks and James Park of Fitbit. Under Murray's guidance, Big Switch has experienced 40+% average QoQ growth for the last 12 quarters. Since he joined the company in late 2013, headcount has doubled and will have tripled by the end of 2017 to support growing market demand for Big Switch's products. Prior to joining Big Switch, Murray ran Juniper Networks' Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China organization, where he was responsible for all aspects of Juniper's business across the region. Previously he held executive positions at Extreme Networks, Sun Microsystems, as well as his first start-up, Sanrise. He started his career at AT&T as an Account Executive and was part of the AT&T Leadership Development Program. Murray has also been a guest lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on the topic of entrepreneurialism. "I am honored to be named an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California semifinalist, and thrilled to be nominated alongside Kyle," said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. "Kyle is the embodiment of entrepreneurialism and made a huge bet in starting Big Switch with Guido. I've never been more proud of the collective work of incredibly smart people, and it is my honor to lead this amazing organization." Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, the head of Stanford University's Clean Slate Lab at the time and pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial 'one big switch' product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company's first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors' expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. "I am thrilled and humbled to be named a semifinalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful," said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. "Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch's success." Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by a customer count that more than doubled in 2016 and a rapidly expanding geographical footprint. In Q4 2016 Big Switch established a dedicated presence in EMEA region and in Q3 2016 into China and ANZ regions. In the latest quarter, the company saw more than 100 transactions across 50 of its customers and has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, in verticals that include: technology, financial services, government, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from venture capital firms including: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more. In 2017 Big Switch was named for the third consecutive year to JMP Securities Super 60 List as well as to CRN's 2017 SDDC 50 and Data Center 100 lists. Big Switch has also been certified a Great Place to Work from the GPTW Institute, with the company receiving a 93% overall employee satisfaction rating.

Since he joined the company in late 2013, headcount has doubled and will have tripled by the end of 2017 to support growing market demand for Big Switch’s products. Prior to joining Big Switch, Murray ran Juniper Networks’ Asia Pacific, Japan and Greater China organization, where he was responsible for all aspects of Juniper’s business across the region. Previously he held executive positions at Extreme Networks, Sun Microsystems, as well as his first start-up, Sanrise. He started his career at AT&T as an Account Executive and was part of the AT&T Leadership Development Program. Murray has also been a guest lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on the topic of entrepreneurialism. „I am honored to be named an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California semifinalist, and thrilled to be nominated alongside Kyle,” said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. „Kyle is the embodiment of entrepreneurialism and made a huge bet in starting Big Switch with Guido. I’ve never been more proud of the collective work of incredibly smart people, and it is my honor to lead this amazing organization.” Kyle Forster founded Big Switch in 2010, starting the company with longtime friend Guido Appenzeller, the head of Stanford University’s Clean Slate Lab at the time and pioneer of the research that became known as SDN. Forster raised the initial financing, refined the initial ‚one big switch’ product vision, helped recruit the early engineering team and found the company’s first customers. Prior to Big Switch, he spent the formative years of his career at Cisco where he brought three products from concept to revenue and received six patents for cellular, wireless LAN and security inventions. Forster watched as hyperscale companies like Facebook and Google started developing their own networking technologies, out-innovating the legacy vendors’ expensive, proprietary solutions. In the early Stanford research, Forster saw an opportunity to bring hyperscale-inspired design to the broader enterprise community and disrupt what was becoming an increasingly stagnant $50B+ networking industry. „I am thrilled and humbled to be named a semifinalist for EY Entrepreneur of the Year Northern California. To be nominated alongside Doug makes this recognition all the more meaningful,” said Kyle Forster, Founder, Big Switch Networks. „Doug was born to lead, and there is no one who deserves this recognition more. His leadership of the company has been synonymous with Big Switch’s success.” Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by a customer count that more than doubled in 2016 and a rapidly expanding geographical footprint. In Q4 2016 Big Switch established a dedicated presence in EMEA region and in Q3 2016 into China and ANZ regions. In the latest quarter, the company saw more than 100 transactions across 50 of its customers and has more than a dozen customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, in verticals that include: technology, financial services, government, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from venture capital firms including: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more. In 2017 Big Switch was named for the third consecutive year to JMP Securities Super 60 List as well as to CRN’s 2017 SDDC 50 and Data Center 100 lists. Big Switch has also been certified a Great Place to Work from the GPTW Institute, with the company receiving a 93% overall employee satisfaction rating. Now celebrating its 31st year, the EY awards program recognizes entrepreneurs in over 145 cities and 60 countries who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in such areas as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. Regional award winners will go on to consideration for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year National Awards.
