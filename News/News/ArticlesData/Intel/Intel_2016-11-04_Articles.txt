Intel recently set a new Guinness World Record for having “The Most UAVs Airborne Simultaneously” with 500 Intel Shooting Star drones. The company outdid its previous record of 100 Shooting Star drones. The Shooting Star drone is Intel’s first entertainment light show drone. Each lightweight quadcopter features encased propellers, can stay aloft for up to twenty minutes, and can travel about 1.5 kilometers. The drones include built-in LED lights that can create over four billion color combinations. The fleet is easily programmed on one computer and light shows can be developed in a few days. Intel has received permission from the FAA to fly the fleet with one pilot at night.  Intel recently acquired German company MAVinci GmbH, “a private fixed-wing company with best-in-class flight planning software.” Intel hopes that its acquisition will not only help improve their light shows, but help provide drone solutions for agriculture, insurance, construction, and mining. Anil Nanduri, vice president in the New Technology Group and general manager of unmanned aviation systems for the Perceptual Computing Group at Intel Corporation, remarked, “We believe drones are an important computing platform for the future and we are continuing to invest in technologies and companies that will enable us to provide the best compute, sensor, communications and software integration for the growing drone ecosystem.” Intel has been very busy this past month. The company recently announced its Falcon 8+ System, the first Intel-branded commercial multi-rotor drone for the North American market. The drone comes with complete flight system redundancies built in. And just yesterday, Intel announced its intention to acquire VR startup firm Voke. Intel's goal with that purchase is to better broadcast captivating sports experiences to audiences through VR.  Tags:  Intel, nasdaq-intc, shooting star drone, guinness-world-records Via:  Intel Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Chrome Crushing It In The Browser Wars...45 Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10...11 Google DeepMind AI's Ability To Discern...9 NVIDIA's Killer GeForce GTX 1080 Ti To...9 Google Rails Against Proprietary USB-C...8 Nintendo NES Classic Edition Sells Out...8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Allegedly...7 FEATURED Samsung SSD 960 EVO NVMe M.2 Review:...

ChromeBook Review Chromebook vs. Laptop – Which is Right For You? Chris Stobing Updated November 11, 2016 Shares Can't decide on a Chromebook or laptop? Read our guide to find out which is right for you. Chromebooks vs. Laptops. It’s a battle that’s been raging for nearly five years now, with plenty of good points being made by those on both sides of the argument. But which portable computer is right for you, and which might hold you back? Read on to find out. Chromebook vs Laptop   Chromebook Laptop Operating System Chrome OS Linux, Windows, OS X 3rd Party Apps Allowed Highly Averse to Malware and Viruses WiFi Expandable Memory Expandable Storage Price Range Low to Medium Medium to High Operating Systems The Chrome OS is limited to Android like apps, which means 3rd party ones aren’t allowed. The three main competing laptop operating systems include OS X on Macbooks, Windows 10 on third-party laptops (Toshiba, Asus, Microsoft, etc), and Linux. Chrome OS, or in this case Chromebooks, which entered the fray not too long ago and is similar to that of Android, certainly isn’t for everyone.  However, it still serves its (limited) purpose pretty well across the board. I’ve personally used a Chromebook for two years as my road laptop, and not once has the OS ever crashed on me. There might be an occasional stutter during a 1080p video on YouTube, but otherwise the lean, mean design of the Chrome OS prevents it from experiencing any significant hangups. Windows is the exact opposite of this, of course. By this point the word “Windows” has basically become synonymous with “pulling your hair out”, and although OS X enjoyed a few years of flawless bliss when Macbooks were gaining in popularity, its reliability has since dropped quite a bit. That said, one of the main reasons both OS X and Windows have problems at all is because they support third-party software and applications, while Chrome OS does not. Last there’s Linux. Technically there are ways you can install a custom Linux build on a Chromebook, so if you’re not totally sold on Chrome OS but still want a new laptop for not a lot of money, check out this guide on which models can support the operating system swap.

The fact is Chrome OS is an extremely closed off ecosystem, one which only allows you to perform a few select functions and not much else. Google keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be “installed” on a Chromebook, if you could even call it that. Almost all of the apps you “install” on your machine don’t actually run locally. Instead Chrome places an icon in your start menu, which is only a link to a website that supports the “program” in Flash or HTML5. The only true apps installed on the machine are the Chrome web browser, as well as offline versions of Docs, Sheets, and Google’s PowerPoint competitor, Slides. Macbooks and PCs on the other hand are made to be customized, and come with the option to install literally hundreds of thousands of different programs and types of software at once. If you need something that can run Photoshop, play your favorite games, or even run an .FLV video file, then a Windows laptop or Macbook will be the de facto choice. CPU and RAM Currently, all Chromebooks ship with Intel processors. Due to a deal inked between Google and Intel, almost all the Chromebooks released last year (and coming in 2016) are equipped with Intel processors. For the AMD faithful this may be an issue, but for most, the Intel mobile line and 5th-generation Core processors can handle Chrome OS just fine. It’s difficult to make a direct comparison of the amount of “power” you get from a Chromebook compared to a standard Windows laptop or Apple Macbook, largely because each one comes with an OS that uses its resources differently. Chrome OS is light, so it runs well on worse (less powerful) hardware.  So the comparison is a moot one. If you were to install Windows on a laptop that had identical specs it would run slower, simply for the fact that Windows has tons of extraneous processes and tasks it runs in the background while nothing else is going on. In short, Windows requires more horsepower to run, much like a big truck requires a larger engine over a smaller car. Storage One area where Chromebooks still need to catch up is with onboard storage. Because they’re made to be cheap and light, almost all Chromebooks come with an SSD opposed to a standard HDD, which ups the cost of manufacturing. As such, it’s rare to find any model of Chromebook with more than 32GB of available onboard storage. To compensate, most Chromebooks will come with 100GB of free cloud storage, provided by Google’s own Drive service. If the idea of keeping all your data on the cloud doesn’t sound like your cup of tea however, it might be better to simply go with a standard laptop instead. Laptops on the other hand come in pretty much any storage configuration you can think of. Want your operating system on an SSD and your games/movies on an HDD backup? There’s a laptop for that. Don’t mind long loading times and just want as much space as possible? There’s a 3TB hard drive just for you.  Screen The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers an excellent screen for a Chromebook. In the pursuit of making these laptops as affordable as possible, sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Screen quality is an area where almost all Chromebooks lag woefully behind the 1366 x 768 curve, and it’s expected that unless it’s a model that specifically touts its HD-capability, you probably won’t be showing it off to your co-workers anytime soon. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was our number #1 pick of the lot for the best Chromebook 2016, a title it won in large part thanks to its absolutely 1920 x 1080 HD IPS screen. If you plan on watching a lot of Netflix or working with color-senstive creative materials online, this model is one of very few that would be able to handle it. On the laptop side of things – it’s a bit all over the place. Some laptops sport stunning 4K screens that can play Blu-Ray content at its absolute peak, while others are so grainy you can barely read a paragraph of text on them without having to adjust your glasses twice. Where touchscreens are concerned, while Windows does maintain the advantage on the sheer number of touchscreen laptops available, many of them are sub-par in quality.  Comparatively, the  ASUS Flip Chromebook made our top Chromebooks of 2016 list both for it’s solid design, and a touchscreen that responds to even the slightest graze of your finger. Keyboard and Trackpad While some Chromebooks are built as cheap as possible and come with keyboards or trackpads to match (looking at you, HP), others, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2, are an absolute dream to type on. Because Chromebooks are made as machines that can help you with work, school, or generally getting a lot of typing done, most of the keyboards on a Chromebook will do the job with flying colors. The trackpads on the other hand are a bit hit or miss. Cost-compared against Windows machines, you’re going to get a similar deal in quality. If you opt for a Macbook however, the trackpad will clearly be superior due to the increased price and money spent on the overall quality of the surrounding hardware. Webcam This one is a bit of an even draw. Chromebooks may come with some cheap components, but Google knows that of all the features that people want on a laptop, the webcam should be up to par. Comparing webcams from several of the top Chromebooks on the market right now against what you’d get in a Windows laptop or Macbook five times the cost, it’s clear that any Chromebook worth its salt will have a webcam that works in most lighting situations, even if you still can’t use it to call someone over Skype. Price Categorically, for the specs you get and the ease of use you should expect out of a device, price is where Chromebooks truly shine. Because Google doesn’t charge third-party companies for use of their OS, manufacturers can use the resources that would have otherwise been spent licensing the operating system on better specs. This means that on a direct 1:1 cost comparison, the hardware you get inside a Chromebook will always edge out what you might find in a competing Windows PC. As for Chromebooks vs. Macbooks; it’s not even a contest. Apple marks up their products by the handful compared to Google. And while a baseline 2015 Macbook Air will run you upwards of $999 at the checkout counter, a comparable Chromebook with the same specs would be nearly three times less, at $330. Read: Best Ultrabook 2016 The whole draw of Chromebooks is that they offer solid hardware at half the cost of what you’d spend on any other laptop. Although they may not have much software to speak of and their onboard storage capacities border on pitiful, you’re getting a fully-functional laptop at a discount so steep it would put lesser companies straight out of business. Which is Right for You, Chromebook or Laptop? In the war between Chromebooks vs. laptops – it looks like the winner comes down to personal preference. The only way you’ll really be able to decide if a Chromebook is right for you (or any members of your family), is to know what you’re going to use it for the most ahead of time. If you only need a machine that goes online, opens web pages, and lets you type to your heart’s content, a Chromebook is the perfect pick. If you think you might need more flexibility down the line however, it might be better to spend your cash on a Windows laptop or Macbook instead. Chrome OS is great for your kid’s first laptop or as a backup while you’re punching out the yearly expense report from an airport terminal.  But it lags behind when it comes to supporting most types of media playback, running third-party software, or gaming on the go. They’re cheap, they’re light, but they also don’t do a whole lot. If that sounds like the perfect marriage of just enough features at just a low enough price, then a Chromebook might be right for you.

The art and science of firework making dates back to 7th century China but chipmaker Intel is hoping that technology can lend a hand in creating awe-inspiring aerial displays of the future. While others seem dead-set on using aerial drones for delivery-based tasks, Intel is experimenting with using them to put on stunning fireworks-like performances. After setting a record last year by putting 100 drones in the sky (all of which were controlled by a single operator), Intel recently broke its own record by using 500 drones simultaneous during a light show (again, all run by a single person). As you can see, the small Shooting Star drones can be used to create displays that simply aren’t possible with traditional fireworks. What they lack in terms of loud screaming and screeching, they more than make up for in sheer flexibility. Intel says they can travel at speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, even in light rain (conditions that might ruin a traditional fireworks presentation). Unfortunately as Re/code notes, the Shooting Star drones aren’t yet available for purchase (nor do we know in what capacity Intel plans to market them).

By Nick Hastings — November 4, 2016 9:41 AM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends This week, Microsoft came out swinging by introducing the Surface Studio, Microsoft’s first all-in-one desktop. The flexible, powerful PC promises to be a game changer for creative minds across the world, and provides some staunch competition for Apple’s flagship computer, the iMac. Since comparisons are inevitable, we thought we’d stay a step ahead and place the two side-by-side. Which computer’s hardware is more powerful? Which boasts the superior design? Let’s find out. Related: Can Dell’s best all-in-one challenge Microsoft’s new Surface Studio? Surface Studio iMac (2016) Display & Dimensions 28-inch PixelSense touch 21.5-inch Retina 4K or 27-inch Retina 5k Processor 6th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 6th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 (27-Inch) or 5th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 (21.5-inch) Operating System Windows 10 Pro MacOS Sierra GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M 2GB or 980M 4GB Intel HD Graphics 6000 up to AMD Radeon R9 M395 4GB RAM 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB 8GB, configurable up to 32GB Hard drive 1TB or 2TB rapid hybrid drive 1TB hard drive or 2TB fusion drive; configurable up to 3TB fusion drive or 1TB SSD Ports USB 3.0 (x4), Mini Displayport, Ethernet, SD card reader USB 3.0 (x4), Thunderbolt (x2), gigabit Ethernet, SDXC card slot Wireless 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, Xbox Wireless built-in 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 Cameras 5.0MP front-facing 1080p with Windows Hello support FaceTime HD camera; supports full native resolution Speakers Stereo 2.1 with Dolby Audio Premium Stereo speakers Microphones Dual microphones Dual microphones Price $2,999+ $1,099+ Availability Available for pre-order now, ships December 15. Available now DT review Hands-on N/A Hardware The Surface Studio is packing Intel 6th-generation Core quad-core processors. Apple’s iMac packs similar in the 27-inch model, but the 21.5-inch model has a 5th-generation Intel Core i5 quad, with optional upgrade to Core i7. That means the smaller iMac is slower, but given the substantial size gap, that’s not too much of an issue. Both computers include high-end graphics cards (assuming you have the 27-inch iMac) that can be beefed up to 4GB of GDDR5 memory. The Studio’s Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M is newer and quicker than the AMD Radeon R9 cards in the iMac, however. And if you really want to boost your graphics, you can buy a GTX 980M for the Surface Studio. Display The Retina display on the 27-inch iMac is a thing of beauty. The 5K model features 5,120 x 2,880-pixel resolution with support for millions of colors, powered by an AMD Radeon R9 graphics card that can be beefed up to an M395X with 4GB of memory. Even considering the UHD beauty of the iMac, though, the Surface Studio is no slouch. Its 28-inch, PixelSense touch display features a 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution, meaning that the Studio’s screen houses about 13.5 million pixels. With 10-point multitouch, the screen can separately identify eight fingers and two thumbs — simultaneously. For reference, most modern smartphones feature 2-point multi touch systems. The Surface Studio boasts an unusual 3:2 aspect ratio, which was implemented to support the pixel density, clocking in at an incredible 192 ppi. The screen’s sharpness is largely in service to color; more specifically, Windows has a built-in feature allowing the user to switch between color spaces, including DCI-P3 and sRGB. It’s a neat feature that allows artists and designers to preview their work under different parameters. The Surface Studio also includes the Surface Pen and the new Surface Dial, tools designed to improve the computer’s touch-screen experience and design accessibility; we’ll go into that a bit later on. In the end, both displays look great. The iMac is sharper, but the Surface Studio’s color is excellent, and the ability to switch color gamuts through the touch of an on-screen button is great for creative professionals. Connectivity and features Both computers offer four USB-3 ports, Ethernet ports, and SD card readers. The iMac, unsurprisingly, is outfitted with dual Thunderbolt 2 ports, while the Surface Studio includes a mini-DisplayPort — though, we’re not sure why you’d want to use any other screen. Each computer is also outfitted with 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth 4.0. The Surface also includes native Xbox Wireless, a reflection of Microsoft’s Play Anywhere initiative. The Surface’s native camera is superior to the iMac’s, though not by much. The Windows Hello sign-in camera can automatically recognize your face and automatically sign you into your computer. It’s not a new feature, but a welcome one all the same. The Studio’s camera supports 1080p, while the FaceTime HD camera is limited to 720p. Design Here’s where Microsoft justifies the astronomical price tag that they’ve affixed to the Surface Studio. The Studio is built for art, whether you’re a graphic designer or an architect. The massive 28-inch touchscreen is mounted on a Zero Gravity Hinge, which allows the display to be shifted up and down, or from your face to your desk. Placing the computer in “design mode” — with the screen tilted back — allows the user to take full advantage of the Surface Pen and the Surface Dial. The hockey-puck-shaped Dial looks innocent enough, but it really shines when plopped onto the screen itself. It clicks and spins — with haptic feedback, so you can feel any changes as they happen — and when you place it onto the display, touch-sensitive menus will automatically pop up around the dial. For instance, turning the dial while drawing might change the color of your digital pencils or the size of your digital brush. The Surface Pen offers the same functionality here as it does on popular tablets such as the Surface Pro 4, providing the user with a diverse set of touch-based tools. The Studio also comes with the new Surface Ergonomic Keyboard, an oddly-shaped thing that continues Microsoft’s pattern of keyboards split down the middle. Built for a more comfortable typing experience, it’s got a wrist pad made of synthetic suede, and two space bars. The iMac is also gorgeous, though. There’s nothing new here from a design perspective, but Apple’s products continue to get thinner and more capable with every build. The machine’s curved, silver body becomes 5-millimeters thick at the edges of the display, and the Retina panel measures just 1.4-millimeters thick across the screen. The iMac ships with Apple’s standard Magic Mouse and Keyboard. Availability and price The Surface Studio is available for pre-order now, and hits shelves on December 15. The Studio comes in three flavors — $2,999, $3,499, and $4,199. The $2,999 version includes a Core i5 processor, while the other two are outfitted with a Core i7. Choosing a more expensive option will also net you more RAM and more storage space. The Surface Studio is an investment, and it’s meant for creative minds that will use the Pen, Dial, and all the bells and whistles. The iMac is available now, and prices range from $1,099 (for the 21.5-inch model) to $2,299 (for the 27-inch Retina display model). Additional configurations and updated components will cost you extra. Conclusion If you’re serious about investing in a computer — especially if you’re an artist, a designer, or anything similar — you should go with the Surface Studio. On the other hand, if you’re not looking to sacrifice your kids’ Christmas presents in order to finance your new computer, check out the iMac. It’s still an awesome piece of technology, one that can be nearly as capable with the right configuration. All things considered, most people will find that the iMac is a better fit, simply because the Surface Studio’s price is justified largely by its bevy of creative tools and features. Those that don’t need the Surface Dial and Pen shouldn’t shell out a few thousand dollars extra, as the Studio is a specialist’s tool, not a simple everyday PC.

Ordinarily, this would be the perfect time to go get a new laptop. But not in 2016. See, although Intel announced its new line of Kaby Lake processors back in August, we won’t see a lot of the new processors in laptops until next year. The new processors promise all sorts of improvements over the current Skylake versions, but even if you don’t care about better 4K video playback, you probably do care about saving money. Which is why you should slowly back away from the Amazon cart, set down the 1-click order button, and wait. DON’T MISS: The worst thing about Apple’s new MacBook Pro in two amazing pictures Kaby Lake is the seventh generation of Intel’s Core processors. On paper, it’s not that much of an upgrade over the Skylake chips that came before. It runs on the same-sized 14nm process, using a mostly-similar architecture to the Skylake chips, so there aren’t any giant improvements in battery life or processing power for general-use applications. But where the new chips should be much better is for specific things like 4K video playback or VR. Intel has started to tailor its silicon to the kinds of intensive tasks that currently tax the processor. It’s the same thing that processor manufacturers have been doing for the last few years for smartphones: rather than just increase overall processing power, Qualcomm, Samsung and Apple have customized their chips so that they’re much better at a specific task. Intel is claiming that you’ll get nearly double the battery life when streaming 4K video off YouTube, which is a huge improvement. Other battery-intensive tasks, like general web browsing, also get a double-digit efficiency boost. So, for the same-size laptop with the same battery, you’ll be getting hours more battery life if you wait for a Kaby Lake chip. Gaming is another good example. The beefy quad-core Kaby Lake processors, which won’t launch until early next year, will have the latest version of Intel’s Iris graphics. We don’t know a ton about it, but we’ve seen demos of thin-and-light laptops running graphically intensive games like Overwatch at a decent FPS. The big question is if the best Iris graphics will be able to handle basic AR or VR tasks. If they can pull that off, it will mean serious graphics performance in a thin laptop with low power draw. So when will be a good time to buy a laptop? The basic, low-power Kaby Lake chips are already out, but we’ll have to wait until sometime early next year for the high-power, quad-core laptop processors that you find in the MacBook Pro or Surface Book. You can expect all the big-name laptop manufacturers to debut laptops packing Kaby Lake, so a few demos at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is a good guess. Even if you don’t care about any of the graphics or efficiency improvements, it’s probably worth waiting until the new year to buy a new laptop. With Kaby Lake computers coming out, the perfectly capable Skylake PCs will be going on sale anyway. Couple those sales with the post-Christmas discounts, and you could be picking up serious PCs for a lot less money than right now. All you have to do is wait.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although expensive, are not really overpriced.  Head-to-head: Spectre x360 vs. 13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech:   Spectre x360  13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar  Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz. It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.  Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.  The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.  Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.  We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Athletics. They’ve rarely had much in common. Intel is betting that will change with the emergence of new technologies, from wearable computing and connected devices to virtual reality. On Thursday, Intel said it has purchased a Silicon Valley business called Voke for an undisclosed sum, to promote “immersive sports.” Voke makes cameras and software designed to stream live, virtual reality. People wearing specially equipped goggles can view athletic events, fashion shows and similar activities with wraparound technology designed to simulate the experience of actually being there. The companies didn’t disclose terms of the deal, but Voke had raised $12.5 million in investment. The chipmaker put Voke in a newly established “Intel Sports Group” run by James Carwana, who was until recently the top assistant to Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. “Sports is being revolutionized by data and the ability to capture, connect, analyze and interact with it,” Carwana wrote in a blog post announcing the Voke deal. “We call this the digitization of sports.” As Intel seeks to expand its business beyond the facing PC industry, the chipmaker has been working to shed a nerdy image linked to cubicle farms and chip factory bunny suits. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, Krzanich touted a robotic scooter, a sports bra with a built-in computer chip, and BMX stunt bikes. The chipmaker has held promotions with the NBA, ESPN’s X Games and touted a 360-degree instant replay technology for professional basketball, baseball and football. Intel said Voke will help it bring “live, virtual reality experiences to audiences.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The question now is INTC stock worth buying at this lower price? There was nothing wrong with Intel’s third-quarter earnings. The chipmaker posted record profits. At 80 cents a share, adjusted earnings exceeded Wall Street’s earnings estimate by 8 cents. That’s a big beat. Sales topped expectations, too. The top line expanded 9% to $15.8 billion. Wall Street was modeling revenue of $15.6 billion. The backward-looking numbers looked pretty good, but then the market doesn’t pay for past performance. It’s all about future earnings, and on that basis, INTC spooked investors. The company guided fourth-quarter revenue to $15.7 billion, which is significantly below what analysts were expecting. The sales hit comes courtesy of start-up costs for next-generation manufacturing capabilities. That sounds like a good use of capital expenditures. Leveraging wise investments to goose future profits is what a company like INTC is supposed to do. But the market was having none of it. Intel stock has lost more than 7% in wake of the Oct. 18 earnings report. 9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in the Long Run The sharp drop in INTC stock seems overdone. After all, it’s not like the company took an axe to its outlook. It’s sort of bizarre. How does the market punish a stock to this degree for issuing slightly disappointing revenue guidance for the ongoing quarter? If Intel didn’t say anything and fourth-quarter revenue came up short of estimates, the drubbing would have been far less severe. Heck, the company missed analysts’ average revenue estimate in the June quarter and pretty much cruised right through. Intel Stock Is on Sale These clues suggest INTC stock might be beaten down for no good reason. Most companies in Intel’s sector — and probably most companies in general — are cutting back on investment. INTC is plowing ahead even as its results and stock takes hits. More importantly, Intel is investing wisely. INTC stock still struggles with the headwind of PC sales. They’re a slowly melting iceberg. But this is old news. What investors should be focusing on is Intel’s success in the segment that makes server chips for cloud-based computing. The Data Center Group contributes about 50% of operating earnings. Revenue is accelerating. This area of growth is a secular, not cyclical, trend. PCs might be in decline, but servers have a bright future.

Intel Falcon 8+, to be distributed by Topcon in Canada and the United States, features triple-redundant AscTec Trinity autopilot capability and has full electronic system redundancy, the company said. It also includes the Intel Cockpit ground control and Powerpack smart battery system. The Intel Falcon 8+ foray into North American markets is a good one, particularly because Topcon has one of the largest UAS reseller and support networks, said Anil Nanduri, Intel UAV Group manager. "The Intel Falcon 8+ System expands on the success of our rotary-wing UAS offering," said Eduardo Falcon, Topcon GeoPositioning Solutions Group executive vice president and general manager. Falcon said the UAS offers high-precision GNSS, weight-to-payload ratio, stability in harsh conditions, and is easily exchangeable. Other features include a dual-battery system, comprised of Intel Powerpack smart batteries, which include automatic balancing, storage mode, charging and LEDs that display remaining battery life to meet airline shipping requirements, the company said. In addition, the Intel Cockpit ground control is water resistant, so operators to plan and execute complex missions with the integration of a single hand, flight control joystick, the company said. The Intel Cockpit ground control also features an Intel-based tablet and supports low-latency digital video links, the company said. Some Intel Falcon 8+ applications include providing precision data for inspection and monitoring, survey, and mapping applications. Copyright © Gibbons Media & Research LLC, all rights reserved.

There are those who have tried to explain and rationalize the gaping holes in Apple’s presentation. Part of Apple’s structuring of the event may have been driven by Intel’s CPU/GPU roadmap. Part of it may have been that Apple executives have been sidetracked by the Apple Car, Campus 2 construction and EU/Ireland affairs. Part of it may have been that they were taken by surprise by both the Microsoft’s Surface Studio design and the warm reaction to it. This might be constructed as some of the case for the defense. The prosecution claims that Apple took too long update all of its Mac lineup. There should have been more periodic updates along the way for each kind of Mac. Leading up to the event, the often cited MacRumors Mac Buying Guide showed that all of the Macs, except the MacBook, have been painfully neglected. The addition of a Touch Pad to the Skylake-based 2016 MacBook Pros wasn’t enough of a broad corporate affirmation to both the mobile and desktop lines. The tagline, “hello again” suggested that Apple would reignite the Mac. It didn’t happen. Neglect and indifference to consumers as well as to technical and creative professionals were cited. Below, I have a list of notable articles for each side of the argument. Then my verdict. Apple’s MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Apple’s Defense 1. Jason Snell presented: “Why 2016 is such a terrible year for the Mac.” He lays out the best defense for Apple by explaining Apple’s situation and the elements of the huge pushback. He’s critical of Apple in parts, but also explains some of Apple’s plight. With respect to Intel’s roadmap: In this case, Apple’s timing appears to have been bad. There’s no way to know for sure, but it seems like Apple decided to dance to its own rhythm, skip an Intel chip generation, and then wait for the good stuff, only to get bitten by slippage in Intel’s schedule. If that’s what happened, it’s hard to blame it on Intel. After all, it was Apple’s gamble. 2. Horace Dediu, in his quintessential analytical style, lays out the business and market forces related to desktop and mobile computing. “Wherefore Art Thou Macintosh.” If the market, the tendencies, the future and all the money are on mobile, it’s going to be hard for Apple not to place all of its attention there. This is a great article. An excerpt: The Mac is thus not treated disparagingly. It deserves and gets respect. It is preserved but with limited responsibilities…. It’s [the Mac] not obsolete but it is a decreasing share of engagement. Alternate ways of doing the jobs it does well with direct input are emerging on the third pivot but they are not yet good enough. The children are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes. There’s still life in the parents…. The Mac is what it is because it’s not alone. It’s part of a family. It is a parent. It strives to be better but will not take the future from its child. 3. Finally, belatedly, the defendant takes the stand. The Independent was later given an interview by Apple SVP Phil Schiller. “Apple’s Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro.” SVP Schiller responds to all the negative outcry about Apple’s deafening silence regarding other Macs. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. Not everyone will see that mea culpa.  That one sentence in the event itself would have saved the day.  Now, on to Apple’s prosecution on page 2.

Pages: 1 2 3 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, Apple TV, Mac 19 Comments Add a comment Imagestealer November 4, 2016 Downright depressing, is what this is. I should have left reading this until Monday. I looked at that Surface Studio machine ad. That is a pretty slick looking piece of equipment. I am also starting to hear good things about Win10 (but it is still WINDOWS ) I then went to the Apple site and priced out a loaded 2016 MBP. (Warning, I live in Canada). Damn near had a heart attack! Almost $6000.00. That does not even include a monitor and the necessary converters to attach all my external drives and other devices. It is extremely unlikely that there is one of these in my future. I will make my existing 15″ rMBP last as long as possible. If Apple is determined to exit the PC business (in spite of their protestations to the contrary), then the least they could do is license macOS. That is the main reason I use Apple PCs in the first place. I can wait for a while, but when I am ready for a new machine, I will be evaluating very carefully if it is worthwhile to remain in the Apple ecosystem. November 4, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM Albatrossflyer November 4, 2016 Until people stop buying iPhones because Apple won’t provide the MacBook Pros, iMacs, & Mac Pros they want, Apple won’t give a damn what you think about their computer lineup. November 4, 2016 at 7:03 EST PM TT November 4, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. November 4, 2016 at 10:14 EST PM MarcusNewton November 5, 2016 With my 20/20 hindsight, I think Apple should have released a spec-bumped MacBook Pro back in July with Skylake processors, and waited until June 2017 to release the touch-bar MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors. This would have allowed Apple to shift the blame squarely on Intel for a delayed redesign, instead of releasing a compromised MacBook Pro this month. One article I read this week said that this new MacBook Pro is not a continuation of that Pro line we are use to (the 2012 line), but it is instead the “full” version of the 12″ MacBook. Based on everything I have read this week I have to sadly agree. I have also seen people now referring to it as MacBook Amateur. I remember when I bought the original iMac, everything necessary was already in the box; including a phone cable so I could connect the modem to the wall outlet. I love the Ad that Jeff Goldblum did for the iMac where he was explaining the 3 steps to get an iMac on the Internet and there was no step 3. One of the main reasons I have so strongly advocated Apple products to friends and family is that I knew that just about everything they would need would be mostly likely included and well thought out with whatever they bought with Apple. With the new MacBook Pro I feel like Apple has set its users adrift into a sea of adapters, cables, dongles, and hubs with little regard as to how that affects the overall Mac experience. Especially, after Amazon revealed how many counterfeit and bogus cables where being sold on its site. Playing Russian roulette with 3rd-party cables and adapters is hardly a positive and consistent user experience. With that said, I am happy about Thunderbolt 3 finally emerging. I love the idea of being able to run two 5K monitors from a single cable while also charging a laptop. However, that is the only thing I need Thunderbolt 3 for. All of my current devices: the audio interfaces, external hard drives, graphics tablets, scanner, and printer, all max out at USB 3 speeds. I am not going to update my $300 Yamaha audio interface just so I can use a USB-C cable; there is literally no improvement. Finally, Apple not supporting 4K on the Apple TV is making me move away from it. I saved up my money and bought a 65″ Samsung 4K SUHD TV with HDR (the KS8000). It is amazing. The TV has Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now apps built right in. Streaming 4K shows off of Netflix like Daredevil, Narcos, and Marco Polo is breathtakingly good. The only reason I have even turned on my Apple TV in the last three weeks was to watch the “hello, again” keynote. I can shoot 4K video on my iPhone, edit the 4K footage in both iMovie and Final Cut Pro on either my iPad Pro or MacBook Pro, but I cannot play it at 4K on my Apple TV. November 5, 2016 at 12:24 EST AM shameermulji November 5, 2016 “Observers have noted that Tim Cook’s presentation seemed strained, not as well rehearsed, and invoked what seems to be filler material at the outset. The team seems to have been up late, re-thinking the agenda in light of what Microsoft announced. All the earmarks of failure to execute are there.” In light of no evidence, that’s nothing more than idle speculation. I think Schiller did a stand up job. November 5, 2016 at 3:17 EST AM geoduck November 5, 2016 It has to be said. Tim Cook must go. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I tried to tell myself that his style was different from Steve Jobs style. Not better or worse just different. That his Apple would be different from the old Apple but the core of what made Apple my favourite company would still be there. But there’s a difference between following a different course and being rudderless. Today’s Apple reminds me a lot of the mid 2000s Microsoft under Balmer. Lots of little pet projects that come and go, but the core systems have stagnated. Apple now worries more about share price, and profit centres more than making great products. That is a philosophical change that starts from the top. The philosophy of Jobs Apple was to make delightful products and profit would follow. The philosophy of Cooks Apple is to chase profit and assume the products will sell. Apple needs another dreamer, someone who knows that these aren’t toasters. Someone that worries more about making the product perfect, than how many pennies he can shave off the cost to get it made. There are people like that out there. The new head of Microsoft is exhibit number 1. Bill Gates choice of Steve Balmer as his replacement showed that the founder of the company is not necessarily the best person to make that choice. It’s time to admit that Steve Jobs choice of Tim Cook was just as misguided. Tim, you had five years, but it isn’t working. You’ve shown that, as talented as you are, you are not the right person for the job. It’s time for Tim to go. November 5, 2016 at 10:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to…fix their Mac lineup. And fix that horrid iOS Music app November 5, 2016 at 11:38 EST AM JoelS November 5, 2016 Totally agree John, but it is worse than that. It is not just the Mac, there is lame all over at Apple. It is time for Tim Cook to go. It is deja vu all over again and they are playing the part of Microsoft 1999. November 5, 2016 at 11:45 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 So who replaces Tim Cook? Certainly Jonny Ive. Elon Musk perhaps. November 5, 2016 at 2:21 EST PM bjeast November 5, 2016 It’s been a long time since there’s been this much criticism about Apple from all quarters. I tried to give Tim cook the benefit of the doubt, but at this point he’s getting perilously close to Ballmer’s reign of error. Yes, the company is still making money. But the Mac is still suffering from neglect. Under his watch, there has been incredibly poor rollouts of the new Maps and Apple Music. Schiller is, amazingly, getting worse at presenting. In fact, this was the worst presentation ever. From the awkward, awkward demos of the touch bar, to the amazingly lame comparison of the new MacBook Pro to an early Apple portable (utterly pointless), the presentation just dragged. It was easily a half an hour or more longer than it needed to be. And yes, I completely agree with everyone who says that the slogan “Hello, Again” was a significant misstep. How anyone could have thought that was a good idea and wouldn’t raise expectations is beyond belief. November 5, 2016 at 4:01 EST PM jeffsz November 5, 2016 There is such a thing as “too much elegance and not enough practicality/value.” I think Apple has crossed over this line with the current crop of MacBooks (I will not call them Pro machines). Thin in a consumer device is nice but really is out of place in a Pro machine. Too thin? Yes. While some are claiming Tim Cook should go, I think his only failing is not having enough balls to stand up to Jone Ive and say, “No! Stop obsessing about thinness!” How about a screen with NO bezel… well, it needs to be thicker. How about some useful legacy ports… well, it needs to be thicker. November 5, 2016 at 5:28 EST PM Jamie November 5, 2016 I hate to admit it, but I agree with the other posters. Tim’s Apple seems to have lost its way. I have no idea who is ultimately responsible, I doubt very much it’s one individual, but I haven’t had thoughts like these about the company since the System 7 days. Something has gotta change. November 5, 2016 at 11:26 EST PM geoduck November 6, 2016 For those that argue that it’s OK because Apple is still making money, I’d like to point out that no matter how Balmer’s Microsoft blundered, it was also profitable. No matter how utterly clueless, leaderless, or feckless Microsoft became, it still made money. November 6, 2016 at 8:29 EST AM archimedes November 6, 2016 I’m not going to join the chorus calling for the head of Messrs. Cook/Schiller/Ive, but I’m puzzled as to why there has been no follow-through on the 2013 Mac Pro, and I agree that “Hello, Again” raised expectations to iMac ’98 level but delivered less of a step forward than Apple’s 2012 Retina MacBook Pro (or the neglected 2013 Mac Pro.) On the other hand, unlike many commenters here, I am a huge fan of the iPad Pro. I rarely use the Microsoft-style smart keyboard, but I use the iPad all the time and find the 12″ form factor to be a definite sweet spot for many uses (sketchbook, music apps, sheet music, reading, video, etc..) Apple doesn’t usually respond directly to competitors, but I would be interested in hearing more from Cupertino about why they think the adjustable drafting table format (e.g. Surface Studio) is a losing idea, and what they think is better for artists, designers and musicians. Personally I find the idea of a large format iOS device to be somewhat appealing. November 6, 2016 at 8:21 EST PM archimedes November 6, 2016 “heads” – sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! November 6, 2016 at 8:23 EST PM Scott B in DC November 6, 2016 Before I make my comment: “heads” – sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! May I recommend Grammarly. Even if you just sign up for the free version and add the Safari Extension, it might be enough to help you get past those typing nits! Since it is getting to be all about the apps, the software we use, what is the difference if that software runs on a Mac or a PC. I can get along without Safari since I use Firefox as an alternative. Other than Photos, what other Mac-only software will keep my tied to my Mac? Don’t get me wrong, I was hoping for an excuse to replace by late-2009 27-inch iMac. But I can see keeping this machine as my bridge for iOS (no, I do not use iCloud) and Photos while I get a Surface Studio for everything else. I’ve already ditched a laptop for an iPad Air, why not ditch the Mac if working in a browser, Word, Evernote, and the other programs work closer to how they do on my iPad than on my Mac? November 6, 2016 at 11:53 EST PM brilor November 7, 2016 Developer Marco Ament wrote a well-reasoned piece. See it here: November 7, 2016 at 10:31 EST AM brilor November 7, 2016 Here is the link. November 7, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM wab95 November 7, 2016 John: For a topic like this, it’s hard to know where to begin, so let me begin with a quote from HL Mencken, “For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong”. To illustrate, as a young intern, I had a complicated post-op patient who had had surgery for aesophageal strictures (look it up if you’re curious). During his recovery, he became febrile. We gave him acetaminophen (Tylenol), and did a workup to rule out infection. There was none. Still, he complained of fever. Clearly, in order to break his fever, I’d have to use something stronger than Tylenol, so I gave him a true non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), ibuprofen. What could be simpler? As expected, his fever broke. And then he began to cough up blood. And bleed. I took no consolation that he was finally afebrile as he was wheeled off to the ICU. It turns out that what the patient had was ‘atelectasis’ or isolated areas of lung collapse that can happen post surgery and can cause fever. The cure for his fever was to make him take deep breaths, and not NSAIDs, which can lead to bleeding, and in this case, made things worse. Who’d have known, right? A more knowledgeable and experienced physician, that’s whom. As an inexperienced intern, I was focussed on the fever and not the whole patient.(I also learnt that New Yorkers have a rich repertoire of words for ‘stupid’, some of them in Yiddish, but I digress). It was a valuable lesson. As an avid Mac user, I realise that the Mac is important, but it’s no longer the core of Apple’s existence, and may not be a vital organ of Apple’s future. Still, it’s tempting to look at Apple, focus on their computer line in isolation and say, ‘Let’s make Apple great again’, on the grounds that the Mac made Apple great in the first place. What could be simpler? The problem with that narrative is that it’s false. Post SJ2, as great as they were, Macs never made Apple great. Rather, that was mobile. The so-called halo effect meant that expanded Mac market share was lofted on the wings of the iPhone, and not by the Mac’s own bootstraps. What about fixing Apple by replacing Tim Cook as Apple’s CEO? Okay, with whom? The point above was that, in a complex situation, clear and simple solutions are seldom correct, and may be harmful. What do we know about CEO replacements at Apple? Empirical data on bringing in CEOs from outside Apple indicate a poor outcome, and that was during a simpler time for the industry and for Apple’s product line up, and pre-dated their global expansion. Leadership today requires an experienced and knowledgeable CEO, proficient both in that system and in leveraging those assets into a prosperous future. That can best be achieved through an apprenticed CEO from within. If anyone doubts this, then point to that company that is currently outcompeting Apple across the entire spectrum of products and services, and is beating Apple at being Apple. Apprenticeship takes time, and is doubtless already underway, but would likely be premature today. The industrial context in which Apple compete is characterised by uncertainty. I suggest that that uncertainty is driven by two things: 1) a plateauing of mature technologies, like CPUs and GPUs, in which real world gains are marginal, and; 2) an abundance of potentially new directions driven by emerging technologies, like AI, virtual reality, robotics, and smart devices like wearables and transportation, to name a few. The choice of direction should be driven by one question; what is the company’s goal? Apple have stated that their goal is to unleash human creativity and make the world a better place. However Apple achieve that, they cannot do so but from a position of strength in finances, footprint, growth and mindshare. I posit that the path to that goal is not a retreat to a comfortable past rooted in mature technologies, particularly one based on a false narrative around one product line nestled in simpler time that no longer exists. Apple, like all living things with a hope of a future, have to adapt and evolve. Finally, regarding the criticism that Apple have squandered precious time on abortive research and development, like the Apple Car, progress from R&D is not, nor has ever been, linear. Furthermore, R&D among integrated technologies has carry-over benefits into related areas even if a specific project is aborted. NASA tech is rife with examples. One can imagine Apple’s car R&D leading to benefits in software, secure systems, robotics, AI, and a host of smart devices, to name just a few. However, such progress is inapparent until Apple invest this in new products, which too are likely under development. The point is that, in an environment of evolving complexity, such as the tech industry, adaptation is essential, but the direction of that adaptation will come at a cost, and if poorly selected, can lead to extinction. The clearest, simplest solution is seldom the right one. A knowledgable and experienced CEO can best shepherd that process, and his/her prescription may, and likely will, run contrary to lay expectations. Further, there is always a lag between environmental change and effective adaptation. While it may not be clear in what direction Apple will or should go, a panicked jettison of their leadership, internal cohesion, or simplistic management of the complex interplay between today’s Apple and their increasingly complex environment will not get them there, neither will an over-emphasis on legacy technology that was never responsible for their rise to prominence.

Similar Robotics View the transcript | Show production credits Intel is entering the commercial drone market with this, the Falcon 8+ INTEL’S FALCON 8+ DRONE The drone is the first from Intel aimed at business users, a market predicted to be worth tens of billions of dollars over the coming years. It’s roots are in the Falcon 8, a drone from Germany’s Ascend Technologies, which Intel acquired in January, and has been designed with the aerial photographing market in mind. “This is a V-shaped Octocopter. It has 8 rotors. It’s designed so that when you have a payload, such as an SLR, none of the rotors are in the images.” The drone can carry a number of different cameras and comes with a host of safety systems to keep it in the sky in the event of a problem. “It’s a fully redundant electronic system. What I mean by that is, with the 8 rotors, you can have up to 2 rotors on each side stop and still fly the drone safely home.” The autopilot has three sensing systems to make it more resistance to interference and even an dead battery won’t make it crash. “we include the Intel Powerpack batteries. So there are two batteries in there and if one is drained out it understands which ones to use to make sure we have a safe flight.” Also new is this controller, the Intel Cockpit. The last one was based on a model airplane controller, this one is way easier with a single joystick for the drone and a second joystick for the camera. Intel hasn’t announced a launch date or price for the drone yet, but it’s part of the company’s push into the drone market. It’s been buying companies this year and has launched a drone development platform called Aero. The company has said it sees us on the cusp of a drone revolution.

Photos of an Intel-Powered Windows Phone Get Leaked GO Evan Blass posts teaser of Windows phone with Intel chip Nov 4, 2016 22:03 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is betting big on ARM chips, and the company still thinks they’re the future, but it turns out that the software giant at least considered an Intel-powered Windows phone at some point, according to a new leak. Evan Blass, also known as @evleaks, has posted photos of what appears to be an Intel-powered Windows Phone, with many believing that it could be an early prototype of the Surface Phone that everyone (still) expects to launch sometime next year. First and foremost, it’s worth mentioning that Evan says absolutely nothing about the Surface Phone, so it’s not clear if it was designed by Microsoft or not. Then, the message he posted hints that this was a project that has already been abandoned, with little chances to see it in production in the coming future. On the other hand, he does confirm that it would have been powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, which means that, instead of Windows 10 Mobile, this phone was capable of running Windows 10 and thus address all the problems of the smartphone operating system, including the lack of apps. Intel-powered Windows phones This isn’t the first time when an Intel-powered Windows phone makes the rounds, and there were even rumors claiming that Microsoft itself was planning such a configuration for the Surface Phone. And while an Intel chip would obviously create a series of advantages on a Windows phone, the biggest challenge would be to offer at least decent battery life, and judging from the design we see here, such a thing was impossible. Fitting a large battery in such a thin body is super difficult and this could be one of the reasons the project was abandoned, if it ever existed in the first place. Unfortunately, this is nothing more than just another teaser that Windows Phone could have done better if some ideas were brought to fruition, so the only thing we can do now is hope that Microsoft is indeed working on a Surface Phone that would be truly innovative.

Weighing in at less than a pound, the small quadcopter is designed to fly in unison with hundreds of other drones, all controlled by a single operator. An individual pilot flew 500 Shooting Star drones simultaneously in early October, breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for most drones operated at once by a single pilot. The flight took place in a small town outside of Munich, Germany, where Intel received a waiver from local regulators to perform the record-breaking flight. Each drone is packed with full-color-range LED lights. The drones fly with the help of Intel’s automation software, which allows artists to design aerial animations with hundreds of drones. It’s the type of coordination that would typically take weeks or months, but Intel says its system can design a complex light show in days. Intel is better known in the drone world for its collision avoidance camera technology, Real Sense, which is used in its industrial-grade Falcon 8 drone, as well as Yuneec’s Typhoon H drone. The system allows drones to weave between obstacles without being piloted, but the new Shooting Star drones aren’t equipped with Real Sense. Intel Instead, the drones are completely controlled by the master computer and operator on the ground. The drones don’t communicate with each other either, so they’re not a swarm, but are rather radio controlled. Although the Shooting Star is the company’s second fully-branded Intel drone — the first was the Falcon 8+ in October — neither is available for sale yet, and the company isn’t sharing how it plans to bring the technology to market. But Intel is better known for what it packs inside computers, like chips and microprocessors, and is less known for its hardware offerings. So until the company provides clarity about how others can buy and use its drones, the technology could just be a demonstration of what might one day end up in other machines, rather than Intel’s own marketable product. Shooting Stars can travel up to 22 miles per hour and can fly in light rain. Watch the video of Intel’s record-breaking flight, featuring 500 drones flying simultaneously under the operation of a single pilot. recode_divider More From Recode LinkedIn’s CEO says the U.S. cares too much about four-year college degrees Where we choose to work is a big deal, office designers Yves Behar and Ryan Mullenix say Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime LinkedIn’s CEO says more than five million jobs will be lost to new tech by 2020 Dropbox is all in on collaborative work, COO Dennis Woodside says TaskRabbit is generating operating income in every city it’s in Trending Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime No satire: The stars of HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ say they got ‘cucked’ in an LA bar The meeting that made Marc Benioff run away from a deal with Microsoft Marc Benioff says companies buy each other for the data, and the government isn’t doing anything about it Philz Coffee can’t pay baristas $25 an hour, but it can help make their lives better More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

Whether it’s the Fourth of July, Guy Fawkes Night in Britain, or a New Year’s Eve celebration, the ecstasy of loud, flying projectiles that go whizz-bang-pop eludes no human. But the folks over at Intel, most well known for making the chips that go inside of your computers, want to use fleets consisting of hundreds of drones to create light shows in the night sky instead. Using small quadcopters that fly in numbers, dubbed Shooting Stars, the company reckons that its drone light shows can “redefine entertainment” by creating “new experiences.” Intel launched 500 of its Shooting Stars in a test in Germany recently, and the results are watchable below. The Shooting Star quadcopter, each of which weighs in at 280g, can stay flying for around 20 minutes, said Intel, and together the fleet can create more than four billion colour combinations with its red, green, blue, and white LEDs. “With the improved software and animation interface on the Intel Shooting Star drone, a light show can now be created in a matter of days instead of weeks or months,” said Intel. The drone shows could come in stark contrast to the rigorous planning, cost, and safety aspects tied to traditional firework displays. According to the American Pyrotechnics Associations, the total annual fireworks industry revenue in the USA is more than one billion dollars, with an approximate 3.5 injuries per 100 lbs of fireworks used. Reusable drones, operated by one pilot as opposed to a crew of safety stewards and display artists, could eradicate much of this. Read more: A Meteor Gave Spain a Fireworks Show on New Year’s Eve “Intel’s proprietary algorithms can automate the animation creation process by using an image and quickly calculating the number of drones needed, determining where drones should be placed and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky.” We have to admit—it does look bloody cool. What’s more, Intel says it has worked with the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) in the US to fly these drones as a fleet with just one pilot, meaning that these aerially choreographed feats are fairly easy to organise. But Intel isn’t the only one gunning for a fireworks finale. As reported by MarketWatch, Walt Disney also wants in on the action. The company filed patents for drones called “Flixels” in 2014—small UAVs that would coordinate in fleets and put on a sparkling light LED light show. Either way, while it’s obvious fleets of drones will soon create incredible night sky performances that could be tailored for specific events, fireworks are best kept alight and exploding (as long as they’re not fired at drones).

When it comes to Intel hardware they do much better however, being able to draw on their massive legacy of x86 apps. This has led many to suggest Microsoft should dump Windows Mobile for simply Windows 10 running on mobile x86 chips, but many naysayers have said this was impossible, despite a few Intel powered Android phones shipping in the past. Now Evan Blass has tweeted a picture of what we suspect may have been a design concept of an Intel-powered Windows Phone which according to his tweet would have run on a laptop class (ie not Atom) Intel processor. In many ways however this power would have been wasted on Windows Mobile, unless Continuum for Phones allowed one to unleash the full power of desktop apps. Blass’s tweet suggest this device is from the past and that there are no plans to take it forward. Hopefully he will release more information soon to let us know exactly what we missed out on. Update: Blass has posted some more images which are clearly marketing material, suggesting the project may be further along than we suspected earlier. His tweet in particular says it’s “More than just a concept” and to stay tuned for more. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/KmPYCPyGV4 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) November 4, 2016 See those pictures in larger size below: The last picture in particular is interesting, because if we are looking at a wireless Continuum for phones scenario, the app on the screen is clearly a win32 desktop app, suggesting we may be looking at Continuum with actual desktop apps.

According to this blog they will be used in IBM's public cloud, Bluemix, for customers to check out Optane performance, being made available free of charge on so-called innovator testbeds, and installed in IBM's Bluemix data centres. The blog claims: Intel Optane technology promises to change the face of computing with an unparalleled combination of low latency, very high endurance, and very high quality of service at extremely high and balanced read and write IOPS. Example application areas are blockchain, quantum compute simulations, cloud-assisted autonomous navigation workloads, high-frequency trading, realtime analytics/databases, and cloud gaming. Intel is contributing to these testbeds and IBM says the Optane SSDs deliver high IOPS at low queue depths, and have higher endurance than NAND SSDs. IBM Bluemix marketing manager John Le writes that an Optane-fitted server can run more virtual machines (VMs) with guaranteed service levels and provide high IOPS per VM. Example SSD-optimised database workloads can experience a fourfold throughput improvement at drive level when using Optane SSDs instead of Intel's P3700 NAND-based SSDs. The P3700 is a PCIe-connected SSD (NVMe) using 20nm MLC flash, and comes in capacities of 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB and 2TB. It does random read/write IOPS at up to 450,000/175,000 and its sequential read/write bandwidth is up to 2.8GBps and 2GBps respectively. We understand its latency is 20μs for writes and 85μs for reads. Its endurance is up to 62.05PB written, meaning 17DWPD/5 years. This is not a slow SSD nor one that will wear out quickly. We note that IBM, and Intel, are saying that example database workloads on a server with an Optane SSD have four times more throughput at drive level than one with P3700 SSD, not revealing the read/write mix or the block size. We assume, perhaps wrongly, that this is at equivalent capacity levels. So let's go with this and say that, assuming 4K block sizes, and a 4X improvement for both reading and writing, the Optane SSD has (4 x 2.8) = 11.2GB/sec sequential read bandwidth, a startling figure, and (4 x2) = 8GB/sec write bandwidth; equally startling. This seems a bit of a stretch, and therefore unlikely. We're going to assume as well that the random read/write IOPS are higher than the P3700's as well, and that Optane's latency is lower, perhaps 10μs for writes. And its endurance may be higher than Intel's P3700 as well. At this point we'll stop trying to derive Optane SSD performance characteristics from IBM's blog as it's getting into far-fetched territory. Bluemix will extend this Optane testbed activity by offering what IBM calls a broad services suite in the second half of 2017. Presumably, though this isn't spelled out, it will also use Lenovo Optane servers. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register Lenovo HPC bounces back after IBM spinoff High performance biz has grown... and customers.. well, they're a little different Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Lenovo soups up storage for supers servers DDN buddy-up A-OK for HPC Lenovo be Nimble, Lenovo be quick, inks deal to take on Dell EMC kit Swaps all-flash array, analytics for channel access 5 Comments Lenovo downward dogs with Yoga BIOS update supporting Linux installs Somewhere a Lenovo engineer is crying over how your OS is accessing the SSD 65 Comments Lenovo big cheese walks Dave McQuarrie tipped to join HP Inc Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

It'd be pretty ugly for the former. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 11:00AM For many years now, a dark cloud has hung over Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) highly successful data-center processor business: the prospect of ARM architecture-based servers. The fear is that if chip companies building processors based on the ARM architecture can collectively take a significant portion of business away from Intel in the server market, Intel's business would suffer, perhaps dramatically. Intel hopes that integrating FPGAs, like the one shown above, with its processor technologies will allow it to better serve data-center customers. Image source: Intel.  ARM Holdings has said publicly that by 2020, it expects its partners will collectively capture 25% of the server processor market. Given that Intel has virtually 100% share, that 25% would necessarily have a significant and highly negative impact on Intel's financials. Let's consider how the loss of such a large amount of market segment share in the server market could affect Intel's financials. Doing some napkin math Intel now expects its data-center group, or DCG, to see revenue growth in the "high-single-digits" percentage range -- let's call it 8%. If we assume that this level of growth continues through 2020, and if we assume that Intel doesn't lose any market segment share in that time, then Intel's total revenue from DCG in 2020 would be in the ballpark of $21.7 billion. Next, if we assume that ARM expects its partners' revenue share to roughly track their unit share (i.e., 25% unit share translates into 25% revenue share), then this would imply that ARM expects its partners to capture approximately $5.43 billion in server chip revenue for themselves, leaving $16.27 billion for Intel.  In other words, if ARM and its partners achieve their shared goal, then Intel's DCG revenue in 2020 will be back to the levels that it saw back in 2015. Does this sound realistic? If ARM's partners do grab the kind of share that ARM is expecting, then their collective share gain would have to happen very rapidly. Intel hasn't given full-year guidance for 2017 yet, but executive Stacy Smith did say on the company's most recent earnings call that management expects to be able to grow its data-center business at a "robust growth rate." Since Intel is apparently planning for DCG to grow in 2017, the substantial share loss that would need to occur for ARM to hit its targets would need to start in earnest during 2018 and probably accelerate quickly through the end of 2020. This certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility, but it would take a combination of incredible execution on the part of several ARM-based server chip vendors, as well as what could only be described as very poor execution on Intel's part for that scenario to realistically play out. Considering Intel's track record here of continued product and market-share leadership and the track records of the various ARM-based vendors -- which is to say, a lot of talk, but also a lot of mediocre products that haven't gained much traction in the marketplace -- ARM has probably placed a little too much faith in its partners' abilities.  Intel can't afford to rest on its laurels, though Although ARM's market share prediction seems overly optimistic, particularly in the timeline given, Intel cannot afford to rest on its laurels or make business decisions under the assumption that it won't face credible threats. Indeed, Intel should work as if its competition is just one product generation away from potentially disrupting its lucrative data-center business. Given that the company continues to step up its investments in DCG, it's likely that management is doing just that.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The VP and GM of Intel's UAV Segment explains why drones fit perfectly into the company's global strategy. By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | November 4, 2016 -- 14:13 GMT (07:13 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel is getting serious about drones, with a string of announcements about unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. The company is known best for its processors, but the Internet of Things makes computers harder to recognize. While yesterday's computing was done in a heavy rectangular box, today's processing takes place in everyday objects and tiny gadgets. Drones are no exception. "We see them as flying computers," Anil Nanduri tells ZDNet. He is Vice President and General Manager of Intel's UAV Segment. Today Intel unveiled its latest creation: The Intel Shooting Star Drone. Nanduri says: Think of it not just as a drone, but as a fleet of drones. It's targeted and specially designed for a light show, and using that system we've already set a new Guinness World Record of 500 drones simultaneously flying. The Shooting Star system is designed for light shows, so it will initially be used for entertainment, such as shows as theme parks, sports stadiums, and large public events (Fourth of July, New Year's Eve, etc.). The show is a bit like battery-powered fireworks, but with Intel's brains behind the operation, fancy animation can be created in just a few days. Each quadcopter weighs just over half a pound, with built-in LED lights that can create more than 4 billion color combinations. The system's algorithms determine where drones should be placed and optimize the flight path. An entire fleet of hundreds of drones can be controlled by a single computer. PHorlbeck The drones include safety features such as propeller cages and geofencing, and they are so lightweight that Nanduri says he didn't even notice when one landed on his head when he stood in the middle of a fleet's landing zone during testing. In the future, Intel's UAV fleets could also be used for more serious pursuits, such as automated building and utility inspections or search and rescue missions. The 500-drone demonstration (and new world record) took place in Germany, but similar drone light shows could be coming to the United States soon. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s new Part 107 commercial drone rules normally prohibit this kind of application, but Intel received a waiver that allows one pilot to be in charge of multiple drones, even while flying at night. Coordinating multiple flying robots is not easy, and swarm robotics is still an emerging technology. Nanduri says that it was particularly challenging for Intel's drone team to manage multiple systems so they don't collide with each other. "So it's not just about a record in terms of the number," he says, "but also the complexity of getting that done and having the system to be able to do that with a single click of a button. We've designed all the software, all the algorithms, everything that we need to manage that in house." Shooting Star is just the latest drone-related announcement from Intel. Earlier this week, Intel announced the acquisition of MAVinci GmbH -- a startup that specializes in fixed wing drone technology and flight-planning software for commercial use. In October, the company launched its first commercial drone, the Intel Falcon 8+ . And at the beginning of the year, Intel acquired German drone maker Ascending Technologies. Now that the FAA is starting to loosen restrictions on commercial drones, these flying robots are being used for many different applications. The result, says Nanduri, is that the drones themselves are becoming smarter, which requires significant computing power. Additionally, he explains, "There's tons of data that needs to be processed, which is going to drive more computing requirements. And anything that requires more computing requirements fits very well with the Intel strategy."

The Shooting Star, the second Intel-branded drone, is made specifically for coordinated use in fleets, using a lightweight design with safety cages around the propellor rotors. Intel released a new video showing an event in Germany where it says a Guinness World Record was set for most simultaneous airborne UAVs in a light show featuring 500 synchronized Shooting Stars.  Earlier this year, Intel received a Part 107 waiver from the FAA that it said will allow the company to demonstrate the new technology in the U.S. Previously, Intel staged what it called "Drone 100," a light show with 100 drones in Palm Springs, CA, but the company said the new waiver will allow it to fly hundreds or thousands of drones at night in the U.S. in the future. "We believe drones are an important computing platform for the future and we are continuing to invest in technologies and companies that will enable us to provide the best compute, sensor, communications and software integration for the growing drone ecosystem," said Anil Nanduri, VP of Intel's New Technology group, in a blog post, "These announcements represent a string of progress we've made in the drone space."

The compact PC is designed to drive up to four 4K displays at once and can be used both for gaming as well as for productivity applications that demand multiple monitors. In fact, the manufacturer officially positions the system as an entry-level machine for VR gaming. The ZOTAC ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 PC is powered by Intel’s Core i5-6400T processor (4C/4T, 2.2 GHz/2.8 GHz, 6 MB LLC cache, 35 W TDP) as well as a custom LGA1151 motherboard with two slots for DDR4-2133 SO-DIMM memory. AMD’s Radeon RX480 MXM module, one M.2-2280 slot for a SATA SSD, a SATA connector, two Gigabit Ethernet controllers, a 802.11ac Wi-Fi/BT 4.2 module and a USB 3.1 controller make up the other key features. When it comes to connectivity, the ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 is an example of reasonable set of I/O ports. The system features two HDMI 2.0, two DisplayPort 1.3, two GbE, two 3.5mm audio, two USB 3.0, two USB 2.0, one USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A and one USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C connectors. In addition, the PC has a 3-in-1 card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC UHS II). Users with 5.1- or 7.1-channel speaker systems will have to use an external USB audio solution however.  From performance point of view, the ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 meets the minimum requirements that Oculus VR set for games compatible with the Oculus Rift VR headset back in the first half of 2015: it has a quad-core CPU along with AMD’s Radeon RX 480 GPU, supports up to 32 GB of DDR4 memory and can be equipped with 2 drives (1x M.2 and 1x 2.5"). If game developers follow recommendations of Oculus VR, the MAGNUS ERX480 should run VR titles for Oculus VR with decent framerate.  ZOTAC ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 Specifications     ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 (barebones) ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 PLUS (w/ DRAM+M.2) ZBOX MAGNUS ERX480 WINDOWS (w/ DRAM+M.2) CPU Intel Core i5-6400T (4 cores, 2.2 GHz/2.8 GHz, 6 MB LLC, 35 W) PCH unknown 100-series Graphics AMD Radeon RX480 at 1050 MHz: 2304 stream processors 144 texture units 32 ROPs 256-bit memory interface 4 GB of GDDR5 7 GT/s memory Memory Two SO-DIMM slots, up to 32 GB of DDR4-2133 8 GB of DDR4-2133 (one module) Storage M.2 SATA 1x SATA 6 Gbps 2.5" 120 GB M.2 SATA SSD 1 TB 2.5" HDD Wi-Fi 802.11ac + BT 4.2 Ethernet Two Gigabit Ethernet with RJ45 connector Display Outputs 2 × HDMI 2.0 2 × DisplayPort 1.2 Audio 3.5 mm audio in and audio out USB 2 × USB 2.0 Type-A (480 Mbps) 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 1 × USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) 1 × USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) Other I/O 3-in-1 card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC UHS II) Dimensions 210 mm × 203 mm × 62.2 mm 8.27 × 7.99 × 2.45 inches PSU External OS - Windows 10 Home Speaking of dimensions, it should be noted that like other MAGNUS-series PCs, the ERX480 is not as tiny as Intel’s NUC, but it is not as large as some other models in Zotac's lineup. The relatively small size of the new compact PC from ZOTAC is a result of the company’s decision to use relatively low-power components (the manufacturer claims that the power draw of the ERX480 is 160 W) and air-cooling. We do not know whether the PC gets noisy under high loads, but this is a possibility as the system uses two blowers. ZOTAC traditionally plans to offer three versions of the MAGNUS ERX480: a barebones with just the CPU and GPU installed; a Plus version with a 8 GB DDR4 memory module, a 120 GB SATA M.2 SSD as well as 1 TB HDD; and a Windows edition with DRAM, storage and Windows 10 Home operating system pre-installed. The manufacturer does not disclose its MSRPs at this time, but claims that all the PCs will be available by the end of November.

POST A COMMENT 28 Comments View All Comments hojnikb - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Any word on when zotac will refresh it's passive mini PCs with kaby lake ? Reply lmcd - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Looks like this particular 480 is notably underclocked compared to retail cards. The question though is whether that underclocking is cautionary or reckless (not enough thermal relief). Makes me regret my Skull Canyon, slightly. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link It could be the mobile varient of the 480, which would be clocked lower and binned higher for lower power consumption. People on forums have underclocked the 480 to dramatically drop it's TDP. People running the 480 at 1100MHz have cut significant voltage off of the chip, reducing it to sub 100 watt TDP in some cases. This may be what zotac did here. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link *1000mhz, not 1100 Reply philehidiot - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link The other question is of course if the desktop 480 hit the bare minimum requirements for VR, does this variant with the lower clock speed mean this that VR performance is compromised? I know they're saying it does, but then the question becomes throttling - are they testing the components using VR in an open enclosure or in the real chassis? Or has it been tested properly with VR at all? Are they just taking components which themselves are rated for VR and then putting a stamp on it without testing how the system performs? I'd honestly be very cautious about buying something like this and expecting decent VR performance, especially if they're having to mess with clock speeds to keep within the thermal envelope. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link true, although a stock desktop 480 also throttles pretty badly in some cases. it was also memory bandwidth bottlenecked IIRC, so that lower clock rate may not do as much harm as it would other cards. It also depends on resolution and graphical quality. You can run VR on a 470 with some sliders turned down, the 480 underclocked should still work pretty well. Reply lmcd - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link I think the real thing to emphasize though is how much the Gigabyte BRIX from a recent Anandtech review struggled in spite of its far-superior cooling system. I can't see this system fairing better. Not to say that the Brix ran into real struggles, but it was an appropriate amount of cooling. With a lower-TDP chip and what appears to be a much better cooling design in the same volume, I'd say this Zotac is probably in trouble. Reply Death666Angel - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link "[...]Gigabyte BRIX from a recent Anandtech review struggled [...]" You mean the GTX950/i7-6700HQ one? Where did that struggle? It ran the CPU @ 3.1GHz, above base clock and the GPU @ 1024 continuously, no throttling. The test even said: "It is heartening to note that the thermal design is indeed very effective even in our unnatural power-virus test." Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link Interesting system, but I never liked the idea of companies using CGI renders of their products instead of photos of the actual item in their announcements and promotional materials. You really only get a vague sense of the product's look and feel. It's excusable in Zotac's case because the company has, I think, a pretty solid reputation for delivering on their promises, but still...meh Reply jaydee - Friday, November 04, 2016 - link It certainly gives the impression that the product isn't going to be out for awhile, because it makes you think they didn't have an actual product to take pictures of.

It is good that the attack has happened now, said Wigle, because it shows that the current state of IoT security is far from where it should be. The technology industry has a window of opportunity to ensure IoT is adopted with maximum security and minimum risk, but that window is small and closing rapidly, she warned. This window is important, said Wigle, because the number of IoT devices is only going to grow and a lot of IoT devices will be in use for decades. “[Internet connected] cars will be on the road for at least 10 to 15 years, so we need to get the security built into these devices,” she said. Equally important, said Wigle, is the need to ensure that security can be “operationalised” in the sense that these devices must be capable of being updated and upgraded when necessary. “This is important because, just five years from now, the threats will probably be of a kind we cannot even imagine today,” she said. Default usernames Returning to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on Dyn, Wigle said one of the most significant aspects of that incident is that the attackers were able to find devices that had default usernames and passwords. “The manufacturer had not shipped them with the requirement that the password be changed, which was a problem because many users had not done so,” she said. For this reason, Intel with its security group is working on technologies to ensure that devices can be “on-boarded” in a way that does not require the user to enter a password using pre-programmed credentials, for example. “In the meantime, we have this tremendous set of vulnerable devices out there that the Dyn attackers were able to take advantage of,” said Wigle. The other significant aspect of the Dyn attack, she said, is that the owners of the IoT devices used to carry out the attack were unaffected and unaware. “There may have been a slight dip in performance, but the real victims were not the owners of the IoT devices,” said Wigle. Threat of ransomware The next phase of attacks taking advantage of vulnerable IoT devices could include weapons such as ransomware, she warned. “If we don’t get ahead of this, we are going to see another wave of attacks that will be a lot more harmful to the consumer,” said Wigle. “What we are working on, which is consistent with other work at Intel Security, is protecting against the threat defence lifecycle, looking at what we need to do to detect, protect and correct, and then adapt. “There are several ways we are doing this, such as making sure there is a good hardware foundation by taking full advantage of what can be built into Intel processors and SOCs and then putting the right software on top of it.” Unique aspects of IoT Intel is also looking at taking advantage of the unique aspects of the IoT. In the automotive sector, for example, the supply chain is hugely important, with up to 80% of component integration done by third-party suppliers. “For this reason, it is very important that we have very good security development lifecycle practices, including managing the supply chain, which is a big part of our approach to protection,” said Wigle. “We also believe that device identity is a fundamental capability that will be really important for IoT, and that it plays a role in both protection and detection, and then, of course, we need to correct.” Read more about IoT security Growth of the internet of things will be slowed or stunted if the industry fails to be proactive about data security, according to IoT Security Foundation. The influx of internet of things devices will inevitably bring security headaches. Don’t miss out on the opportunities of IoT, but learn how to avoid IoT security issues. The five key information security risks associated with the internet of things that businesses can and should address. The growing threat of the internet of things is quickly becoming a reality as new attack methods emerge. The other unique aspect of the IoT that needs to be thoroughly understood by system makers is the fact that, in many cases, IoT devices interact with the physical world, said Wigle. “This is one of the things that make IoT devices unique, so we need to be thoughtful in system design about what happens if a compromise is detected, so that devices fail in a safe way,” she said. Intel believes the key to enabling secure IoT starts with a secure hardware foundation, which includes, for example, secure boot, having a place to store secrets, having hardware identity, having software identify – or a way to attest that it has not been modified – and a trusted execution environment. “Then we have a lot of capabilities that we can put on top of that,” said Wigle. “Things like our whitelisting technology – McAfee embedded control – which is a wonderful capability for IoT devices because most of them have a limited set of functions that they need to perform, so it is much easier to lock down what can run rather than trying to keep a set of hashes up to date to blacklist what can’t run.” Other key elements include encryption of the data, policy management for the security activities associated with the devices, and mechanisms for provisioning and revocation. Wigle emphasised that no single company can solve the IoT security problem. “We need to work together as an industry,” she said, and highlighted three key cross-industry initiatives: 1. The Industrial Internet Consortium 2. Open Connectivity Foundation 3. GSM Association In collaboration with the Industrial Internet Consortium of about 250 companies, Intel Security has recently published a security framework document, said Wigle. “This is a 75-page prescription for how to secure an industrial internet system, which has been extremely well received by the industry and the analyst community,” she said. The Open Connectivity Foundation effort is more consumer-focused, but significantly has united two previously competing initiatives by Qualcomm and Samsung and Intel. “It also includes open source implementation, so the group does specifications but also does open source implementations that makes it easier to adopt,” said Wigle. The GSM Association effort, she said, is being driven more from Europe, but is working with Intel Security, which contributed to the publication of guidance for IoT security. “This contains strong recommendations for device makers, network makers and cloud services providers, as well as a self-certification checklist,” said Wigle. The checklist is aimed at helping device makers to evaluate their organisational capacity to do things like risk assessments and follow a secure development lifecycle, and to evaluate specific devices and implementations. “This is a really promising effort, and we are excited about it because a lot of governments want to do something around IoT security, and this is a thoughtful industry approach that hopefully regulators can build on,” said Wigle.

Hmm... Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 04 November, 2016 04:56 0 - - - - print email Very few people have likely either seen or heard of VR sports at this point, but that hasn’t stopped Intel from quickly snapping up its second startup, Voke, to lock up what it calls “immersive sports experiences.” Intel said Thursday that it has bought Voke, described as a leader in bringing “live, virtual reality experiences to consumers.” “Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender’s perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback’s perspective,” James Carwana, the general manager of Intel’s Sports Group, wrote in a blog post. “This kind of experience may sound futuristic, but it’s closer than you think.” Voke uses an array of paired-lens, stereoscopic cameras to capture events like the Final Four and New York’s Fashion Week, then allows users to hopscotch around them to view the action from their choice of perspective. That’s somewhat similar to Intel’s second VR acqusition, Replay Technologies, which Intel bought in March. Replay uses what it calls “freeD” cameras scattered around a basketball court, and combines the video inside Intel’s own servers. The aggregated, stitched-together video feed essentially turns a live feed of a basketball game into a live 3D model of the action, which users can also rotate or zoom in and out of to experience the action as they want. It appears that Voke’s technology may be used to provide more realistic video images that could be later stitched together using the Replay technology. Voke’s technology can be viewed via phones, the Web, or the PC, as well as a VR headset. The company partnered with Oculus and Facebook to broadcast the NCAA men’s basketball final in 3D. Why this matters: If you’ve sat through any of Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich’s recent speeches, you’ve probably seen Intel’s newfound love of data represented in a variety of ways: 4K camera-equipped drones, or measuring the “vert” of a BMX biker as she flies through the air. All of these either use an array of sensors or machine interpretation of live video, generating tons of data for Intel’s processors to crunch. Meanwhile, Intel’s hoping that a new generation of fans who tweet and blog and play fantasy football regularly will be interested in a sports broadcast experience that can be manipulated and assessed in real time, turning fans into analysts. Culturally, that means one major change, too: Because broadcasters like NBC can’t deliver an interactive experience, that means games delivered via the Voke technology would be viewable only on a PC or smartphone. Meanwhile, so-called smart TVs have typically only been able to display streaming media like Netflix. Could Intel have something more powerful in mind?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Why 2016 is such a terrible year for the Mac Jason Snell 4 November, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News There’s a lot of unease out there among Mac users. First, there was the lack of 2016 updates to any Mac model that wasn’t the littlest MacBook. The Mac Pro and Mac mini have languished for several years with nary an update. And MacBook Pro users were hungry for a new model – and fuelled by constant rumours all year of brand new laptops that were just over the horizon. Then we finally got the new MacBook Pro, and it’s loaded with a lot of cool stuff, but… the reaction wasn’t quite what Apple may have expected from the hungry crowd of Mac users. I suspect that the long delay between major Mac announcements has made everyone a bit anxious about what might come next. Certainly, a lot of people seemed to have invested a whole lot of concern about the future of the Mac into what Apple announced on stage last week. Desktop doom It wasn’t an updated iMac, Mac Pro or Mac mini. It was probably never going to be, but can you blame Mac Pro fans for being upset that yet another Mac event has passed while that model remains unchanged since its introduction? Then there’s the MacBook Pro itself, which is a quintessential Apple product in that it’s got a point of view and, like most points of view, it’s not for everyone. Among the issues these new laptops present to pro-level Mac users: they’re limited to 16GB of RAM due to a decision by Apple to optimise for power efficiency, their base prices are higher and currency issues make this doubly painful for users in many international markets and they came right after Microsoft whipped up a lot of excitement for its forthcoming touchscreen Surface Studio, which seems targeted at Apple’s traditional market of creative professionals. Apple’s Phil Schiller told The Independent that he was surprised by the negative reaction to the announcements. Maybe Schiller wasn’t aware of the undercurrent of concern and anger among Mac users who feel that Apple has deprioritised the Mac, and that the lack of updates to the Mac Pro becomes more frustrating with every passing day. (It’s been more than a thousand days now, by the way.) Some of that concern and anger is reasonable, and some of it isn’t. But even the less reasonable reactions are Apple’s fault for letting it get to this point. The longer you go without Mac updates, the more time customers have to combine their anger and frustration with wishcasting about the product that will solve all their problems and make everything better. It’s hard to see how Apple would’ve been able to please everybody last week – though as Chuq von Rospach pointed out, a brief reassurance about the importance of the Mac and the fate of the Mac Pro may have been enough – but releasing an opinionated new MacBook Pro was never going to do it. Apple shrugged Apple’s lack of Mac movement in 2016 plays on every Mac user’s fear of abandonment in the shadow of the success of the iPhone. The Mac is 12 percent of Apple’s business, and this year it felt like even less than that. Apple’s also yoked to Intel in terms of providing new Macs, a situation that the company doesn’t seem to like – and sometimes rebels against by releasing products on its own schedule rather than Intel’s. In this case, Apple’s timing appears to have been bad. There’s no way to know for sure, but it seems like Apple decided to dance to its own rhythm, skip an Intel chip generation and then wait for the good stuff, only to get bitten by slippage in Intel’s schedule. If that’s what happened, it’s hard to blame it on Intel. After all, it was Apple’s gamble. Regardless, the Mac Pro has not been updated in an unconscionably long time. The current Mac Pro, which you can still buy, is three years old. It hasn’t been updated once. The Mac Pro may not sell many units at all – and, truth be told, even two years ago the 5K iMac was arguably a better Mac than the Mac Pro – but it’s also symbolic. It represents some part of Apple’s commitment to its professional user base, a small but enthusiastic group that includes developers and other highly technical folks. And users of the MacBook Pro had to look on and wonder if Apple’s commitment to them was wavering, too. Does Apple care? I believe Apple is committed to the Mac. But it’s committed to it as a ‘classic computing’ device, a keyboard-and-mouse computer like the ones we’ve been using since the original Mac. Apple already has a next-generation operating system built for touch. The Mac still exists because it’s not iOS, and never will be. So Apple is left with finding ways to cleverly integrate the lessons it’s learned on iOS in ways that don’t break the metaphor. The Touch Bar is a good example of this. It’s essentially a miniature iOS screen turned into an input device to amplify the keyboard. Apple’s also has to be realistic about the Mac. It’s a product in a declining category (personal computers) that the company is improving where possible while also keeping its fundamental metaphor in mind. Microsoft doesn’t want to do this. It doesn’t have a successful mobile operating system in its stable, so it’s adapting Windows PCs to serve both purposes. The Surface Studio is an example of the fruits of that approach. It’s far more likely that Apple would build a 24in iPad than release a touchscreen iMac in the style of the Surface Studio. The danger at the margins A lot of the criticism of the MacBook Pro by high-end users seems justified. The 16GB RAM maximum, while irrelevant for most users, will be very tough for some users to swallow. In fact, some of them may be driven off the platform. Similarly, there’s a lot of griping about the graphics processors in these new systems. The question is, did Apple do the right thing in optimising the MacBook Pro for thinness and lightness rather than high-end computing features? My guess is that Apple is well-aware of what kind of people use its computers, and is going to make product decisions that appeal to the vast majority of those users. For those on the margins, the question will be if staying on Apple products is worth the pain, or if it isn’t. The danger for Apple is how many people are on those margins, and how influential those people are. If the company has miscalculated, it may cede users that keep the Mac platform strong, and that could slow the Mac’s momentum when compared to the PC industry at large. But Apple’s job is not to build a computer to reflect the needs of every current or prospective Mac user; it’s to make the best product for the largest number of people in the target market. People will complain about the move to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 on these new systems, but every change in ports inevitably leads to two things: complaints and adapters. We’ll see a lot of both in the coming months, but then we’ll get over it. A larger danger for Apple, I think, is affordability. The move to Retina has dramatically increased the price of all of Apple’s laptops. The 13in MacBook Air is still kicking around at US$999, but the new 13in MacBook Pro, by all rights the proper successor to the 13in Air, costs US$500 more. A product line that once began at US$899 now begins (leaving the Air aside for a moment) at US$1299. I’m not sure what solves this one other than time, but it’s an issue. Does Apple care about the Mac? I think it absolutely does, and that this year was a series of unfortunate events that made things seem worse than they are. But this is not to say that there aren’t some serious issues with the Mac. If, in six months, we’re still sitting here wondering what’s up with the iMac and Mac Pro, it might be time to revisit this. But I suspect than in six months Apple will have renewed most or all of the Mac product line (all powered by USB-C/Thunderbolt 3), and things will feel shiny and new again.

Intel has said it will derive revenue from Optane sales this year, but shipments aren't expected to flow until early 2017. It's widely accepted that once Optane and rival storage-class non-volatile memory arrives it will spark a rethink of how we build applications, servers, storage and networks. But because no plan survives contact with the enemy, figuring out just what will need to change is largely a speculative venture. Some opine that Optane will mean servers will have such rapid access to data that networks will become a bottleneck. Others The Register has encountered suggest that Optane and its ilk could become a new tier of RAM. The Gen-Z alliance of Dell, HPE, IBM, ARM, Samsung and pals even suggest a memory fabric is needed, perhaps alongside boxes that do nothing but provide memory to servers in the same rack. IBM's silent on just what its Optane cloud will offer, but has given us a hint by also announcing it's cooked up a cloudy Optane testbed that will feature Lenovo servers stuffed to the gills with Intel's new offering. Big Blue says the testbed is intended for “end users and software vendors looking to discover new innovations as well as test and optimise applications.” Interested?

Ian King More stories by Ian King November 3, 2016 — 6:14 PM EDT November 3, 2016 — 6:14 PM EDT Room Service, From a Robot Relay is waist-high. It has mood lighting, touch screens, and chirps as it wheels along hotel hallways, delivering Cheetos,  Kraft Mac and Cheese, and hairspray to guests. There are only a handful of Relays deployed in several Silicon Valley hotels right now. But Intel Corp., which invested in the robot's maker, Savioke Inc., thinks the future will be full of such helpers.  Underneath Relay's curvy exterior is artificial intelligence software that allows it to use cameras and other sensors to independently navigate through the hotel without running anyone over. Being aware of what's going around them is crucial if robots are going to transition from cages on factory floors to hotels, homes and other places where they could easily hurt humans. "Technology's gotten to a point where robots can make sense of the world in real time,'' said Steve Cousins, Savioke's founder and chief executive officer. "If the robot can see the world, process what it's seeing, and make a decision in real time, then it can be around us.'' Relay robot has a compartment to hold items. Photograph: David Nicholson, Bloomberg The markets that have provided Intel with the bulk of its sales-- personal computers and smartphones-- are slowing. Robotics is one of a number of fields that the company is hoping will pick up the slack. Yet robots alone can't make up for PC market contraction and they aren't even close to matching the 1.2 billion annual shipments of the smartphone sector. "We are a couple of decades away from that,'' said Gartner robot analyst Gerald Van Hoy. He estimates the current market for robots is in the tens of millions of units per year and significant growth won't start until around 2020. Savioke isn't chasing mass volume sales. It leases the robots to hotels and manages them remotely. That provides it with recurring income and incentivizes it to build products that are reliable and will last, Cousins said. It also removes the burden of maintenance and management from the hotel. "The team at Savioke has done an exemplary job growing the market for service robotics,'' said Wendell Brooks, president of Intel's investment arm. "Intel Capital sees significant opportunity in this important new market." At the Crowne Plaza San Jose, their version of Relay, which they've named Dash, started making deliveries last year. Front desk workers take orders from guests, then put the requested item into a plastic container under a lid on the top of the robot. They punch a room number into the touch screen and go back to whatever they were doing. ``In the beginning, everyone was just excited about a new toy,'' said David Wang, head of sales at the hotel. ``Then we saw all the benefits that he had for both the employees and the guests.'' Relay robot on its way to make a delivery. Photographer: David Nicholson, Bloomberg The robot makes deliveries within around three minutes of the order being placed, Wang said. Dash chirps when it's about to move, and can summon elevators. It uses a map with sensors to navigate the building, and if it comes across a person or laundry cart, it either stops and waits or looks for a way around. When guests receive an automated call to let them know their delivery has arrived, they open the door to find Dash waiting with its container lid open. Giving the service a five-star rating on Dash's  touch screen triggers a robot happy dance. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Define your site main menu Dell’s Precision T3500 Tower Workstation Dell offers four tower workstations in it’s Precision line of products: T1600, T3500, T5500, and T7500. The T3500 is the most affordable of the Tx500 line, but still provides plenty of power and options for professional use. Dell’s Precision T3500 provides a good selection of options and performance at entry-level prices. It is an excellent choice for professional users. The Precision T3500 is targeted towards professional users of CAD, animation, and video editing software. These are demanding applications in terms of CPU, video, and RAM requirements. The T3500 can provide good performance in all these areas. Power Supply The T3500 is powered by a beefy 525 watt power supply, and for $50 you can upgrade to an 85% efficient power supply which also supplies 525 watts to the chassis. Motherboard The T3500 motherboard utilizes Intel’s X58 chipset and provides ample options in terms of both usability and expansion. Intel’s X58 chipset provides an integrated SATA 3.0Gb/s host controller which support host based RAID 0/1/5/10. The built-in Broadcom 5761 Gigabit Ethernet controller supports both PXE and Remote Wake Up. An integrated sound card provides high definition audio along with 24-bit analog-to-digital and 24-bit digital-to-analog stereo conversion. 6 DIMM slots are available, which enables you to install up to 24GB of 1333Mhz DDR3 SDRAM. Both ECC and non-ECC memory are supported. The base configuration ships with two 1GB DIMM’s. Upgrading to 6GB will cost you $260 and upgrading to 12GB will cost you $680. If you are upgrading to 12GB, you will probably want to pay $720 to get three 4GB DIMMs instead of six 2GB DIMMs. The motherboard provides two PCI-e x16 Gen 2 graphics slots, two PCI-e x8 slot wired as x4 (one full-length and one half-length), and two half-length PCI slots. The T3500 offers a generous supply of USB ports — eleven in total. Two are located on the front panel, six are located in the rear, and three are internal. It also offers one eSATA port in the read, along with an RJ-45 gigabit Ethernet port, a parallel port, a serial port, and two PS/2 ports. CPU Options The base CPU is an Intel dual core 45nm 2.40Ghz Xeon W3503 with 4MB of Smart Cache. This CPU provides an Intel QPI speed of 4.8 GT/s. If your applications will benefit from increased CPU power and your budget has room, you can upgrade to any of these Intel Xeon processors: Dual Core 2.53Ghz Xeon W3505 with 4MB of Smart Cache Quad Core 2.80Ghz Xeon W3530 with 8MB of Smart Cache Quad Core 3.00Ghz Xeon W3550 with 8MB of Smart Cache Quad Core 3.20Ghz Xeon W3565 with 8MB of Smart Cache Six Core 3.20Ghz Xeon W3670 with 12MB of Smart Cache Six Core 3.46Ghz Xeon W3690 with 12MB of Smart Cache Video Options The base video card provided with the T3500 is an ATI FireMV 2260 with 256MB of video RAM. The card offers two DisplayPort outputs and comes with a DP to DVI adapter. Befitting it’s role as a animation and video editing platform, Dell offers a wide variety of video options for the T3500. You can choose from ATI’s FireMV or FirePro cards as well as NVIDIA Quadro NVS cards. Video RAM on the cards ranges from 256MB up to 2.5MB on the NVIDIA Quadro 5000. Upgrading to the 1GB ATI FirePro V4800 or the 1GB NVIDIA Quadro 600 can be done for only $80, so there isn’t too much reason to stick with the base video card. The V4800 even supports three monitors. Hard Drives The base hard drive is a 500GB 3.0Gb/s SATA drive with NCQ and 16MB DataBurst Cache. The T3500 case limits hard drive expansion by offering only two internal 3.5″ hard drive bays. There are also two external 5.25″ optical bays, so you could convert one to a hard drive bay while using the other for an optical drive. There is also an external 3.5″ flex bay which you can use for a media card reader or to store a fourth hard drive. DVD The base DVD is a 16X DVD-ROM. Most buyers who still use optical media will want to upgrade to one of the DVD+/-RW drives. Monitors Dell offers a good range of monitors with the T3500: Professional P170S 17″ Professional P1911 19″ Professional P190S 19″ E Series E2210 22″ Professional P2210 22″ UltraSharp 2007FP 20″ UltraSharp U2410 24″ The UltraSharp monitors provide 1600×1200 resolutions and 16ms response times, which are excellent for video editing and animation work.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 05, 2016 Perhaps it was the lack of ports that did it for you. Or maybe it was the removal of the MagSafe power connector. Or maybe it was the weird mini-touchscreen that replaced the function keys for an extra $300. Or maybe you just think Apple is boring now. Whatever the reason, it seems that the new MacBook Pro, announced last week, has been somewhat underwhelming critics and prospective buyers. While the computers are as well-built as any Apple product in recent memory, they seem to be needlessly minimalistic and expensive, removing all the ports, bar four USB-C ports that don’t connect to any legacy Apple products, or even the company’s newest smartphones without buying more cables. They also feature a thin touchscreen that is likely frustrating to use if you’re blind, and last year’s processors. If any of these factors are causing you to reconsider your relationship with Apple’s laptops, this guide is for you. Quartz has complied a list of Windows laptops to consider, as well as Windows programs, to replace the MacBook-shaped hole in your life. Windows laptops There was a time when Apple was really the only company that seemed to be able to pull off well-designed laptops. But in recent years, some of the largest Windows computer manufacturers have shown that they too can produce some great designs, and Windows 10, Microsoft’s latest operating system, is actually not terrible. Here’s a few computers that longtime Mac users may want to consider over the new MacBook Pro: Ones that look like MacBooks ASUS ZenBook (ASUS) The ASUS line of laptops have been getting decent reviews, and the UX303UA model looks like a slightly more angular MacBook Pro. For $900, you get a 13-inch machine with the same basic specs as the new MacBook Pros (an Intel Core i5 processor and a 256 GB solid-state hard drive) as well as decent battery life and a touchscreen. And it comes in rose gold. The UX390UA model, which ASUS is also calling the ZenBook 3, happens to look just like a MacBook, as well, except that it comes in a nifty shade of blue: (ASUS) HP EliteBook Folio. From a distance, it would be very easy to mistake this for a MacBook, were it not for the rather large HP logo just below the screen. The Verge called it a “beautifully designed laptop” (although gave it an underwhelming 6/10 review). For $1,000, you get a 128 GB solid-state hard drive and 8 GB of RAM, but you also get a touchscreen that folds down 180 degrees (for some reason), a biometric infrared eye scanner (like the one in the exploding Samsung Note 7), and a computer that is apparently drop- and dust-proof. HP Envy 13 (HP) CNET said HP’s other MacBook clone was one of computers that ushered in an era where “quality became affordable” in Windows computers. This $850 machine has the same basic specs as the EliteBook Folio, without the touchscreen. HP Spectre (HP) HP’s super-thin flagship laptop, which the company says was built with “artisan materials and striking craftsmanship,” looks rather like a MacBook designed in the 1980s: Replace the silver for black and gold, and you get the Spectre. The computer has a 13.3-inch touchscreen, a battery that can last all day, 8 GB of memory, a 256 GB solid-state hard drive, and will set you back about $1,200. Microsoft Surface Book Microsoft’s first homemade laptop got a specs refresh just last week and is definitely a different machine from the MacBook Pro, even if it looks quite similar. It features a zany bendy hinge, a detachable touchscreen, and works with a stylus so you can draw circles on the screen to your heart’s content. For $1,500, you get the pen, 8 GB of memory, and a 128 GB hard drive. There are lots of upgrade options, all the way up to a $3,200 machine with a 1 TB hard drive and 16 GB of memory, if that’s something you feel you need. Ones that look like something different Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (Lenovo) Lenovo’s ThinkPad design, which dates back to when IBM still produced these laptops, has been around for decades. But this machine features a high-resolution 14-inch touchscreen that folds back to turn it into a tablet. It also has a fingerprint reader, and iffy battery life, according to The Verge. For $1,400, you get a 128 GB hard drive, 8 GB of memory, and that weird little red nub mouse thing that’s been on every ThinkPad computer ever. Lenovo Yoga 900 (Lenovo) Much like the other Lenovo Yoga on this list, this thin touchscreen laptop can contort itself into a tablet setup, but this one comes in a striking shade of bright orange, and doesn’t have the weird nubby mouse. For $1,150, you get a 13.3-inch screen, 8 GB of memory, and a 256 GB hard drive. (There’s also a newer 910 model that costs about $200 more for roughly the same specs and does not come in the same shade of orange, sadly.) Dell XPS 13 (Dell) Many publications, including The Verge, Wirecutter, and PC World, have called Dell’s laptop the “best” Windows computer out there. The screen is wonderfully sharp, and almost seems to bleed onto the edges of the device, as there’s almost no bezel around it. The body is a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber, and would not look out of place in a Christopher Nolan Batman film. The XPS 13 starts at a measly $800, and for that you get Intel’s newest processors, 4 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage. For $1,150, you can get the specs to match the MacBook Pro. Dude, you might be getting a Dell. Razer Blade Stealth (Razer) Gaming-computer company Razer has made some impressive laptops in recent years that are powerful enough to play some of the most processor-heavy video games on the market—something Apple has never striven to do. The Blade Stealth kind of looks like a metal version of the old plastic MacBooks, and for $1,600, you get the newest Intel chips, a 4K touchscreen, 512 GB of storage, and a whole bunch of ports. But you’d also be supporting a company that has recently made some very questionable marketing decisions. Replacements for Apple apps One of macOS’s main selling points over the years has been the suite of (relatively) simple-to-use and often free software that comes bundled with Mac computers. There aren’t direct correlations on Windows, but here are a few programs that could replicate some of the most-used Apple apps: iTunes. There aren’t a whole lot of decent music management programs out there in 2016 (and even iTunes isn’t all that great), but you can use iTunes on Windows machines if you’re sticking with your iPhone. If, however, you want a clean break from Apple, Google’s music management service, Google Play Music, is pretty great. Follow these instructions, and Google’s music manager will trawl through your computer and upload all the music on your hard drive for free, up to 50,000 songs. There’s also always Windows Media Player, but that’s never really been a great choice. Photos. Windows comes with a built-in ability to manage photos, but if you want something a bit more powerful, you can subscribe to Adobe Lightroom for $10 per month. Otherwise, again, Google offers a powerful free solution, called Google Photos. There are Android and iOS apps, as well as a website that lets you upload and catalogue every photo you’ve ever taken, and search them using regular words. You can search for your photos of “cats” or “taxi” or “food” or “France,” and it’ll find all the photos that fit that description using AI. Google Photos also allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos and videos in HD, though not the full resolution of the photo. Yahoo’s Flickr offers a similar service, with 1 TB of photo-storing space for free. iWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). This one should be pretty easy to replace: For office productivity software, the unsurprising choice is Microsoft Office. You can buy a home edition online for about $120, or subscribe to Office 365 for about $70 per year, which gives you access to your documents in the cloud (with 1 TB of storage), and auto-updating desktop apps. There are also far cheaper options out there, such as Google Docs, whose web apps work about 90% as well as their Microsoft or Apple counterparts. GarageBand. This is one small area where the Mac ecosystem really shines, as there aren’t many great inexpensive replacements on Windows. You could get an emulator to try to run the Mac program on a Windows computer, but I wouldn’t recommend that. If you’re just looking for a simple voice recording tool, there are options like Audacity, which works exceedingly well for what it does. For more complex projects, there’s the open-source LMMS, which is maintained by a group of engineers for free. Stagelight 3, which looks very similar to GarageBand, costs $10 for the basic software, or $50 for the full package. There’s also more professional software like Abelton Live, which ranges from $100 to over $700. iMovie. Similar to Garageband, there aren’t any direct correlations between Windows and Mac for hobbyist movie-makers. Microsoft does make a program called Movie Maker that is not wholly unlike iMovie, but a version for Windows 10 hasn’t officially been released yet. There are free options like avidemux and the VSDC video editor. If you want something with the utility of iMovie, you’re likely going to have to pay for software like Adobe Premiere, which you can purchase as part of a $20-a-month or $50-a-month subscription bundle from Adobe.

Define your site main menu How to Reset a BIOS Password On PCs, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is updatable computer firmware designed to initialize the computer during start prior to handing control to the operating system. Due to the sensitive nature of the system settings controlled by the BIOS, a password can be set by either the computer manufacturer or the end-user. Some of the most common BIOS producers include AMI, AWARD, IBM, and Phoenix with many manufacturers making their own changes to the firmware prior to selling a computer on the open market. The common methods to reset BIOS password include: Generating a BIOS password using a hash code, entering a backdoor BIOS password, reset the BIOS password using software, reset the BIOS password using hardware, and resetting the BIOS password with vendor specific solutions. How Does the BIOS Work? The computer BIOS is the first programming code executed by a PC when the machine is rebooted or turned on. The computer firmware conducts a power-on self-test of the system which is responsible for identifying system hardware and initializing components such as the CPU, hard drive(s), RAM, video card, mouse, and keyboard. Once the initialization task is complete, the BIOS checks the boot devices in order of configured preference (traditional default setting is the computer’s hard drive). The boot loader software is executed by the BIOS once located, and control of the computer is then passed to the operating system. Functionality that can be changed by the end-user through the BIOS user interface (UI) include setting the system clock, enabling or disabling system hardware, configuring hardware, enabling or setting passwords, and choosing the order of boot devices. Although the BIOS was originally stored on a ROM (read only memory) chip on the computer’s motherboard, today’s computers will store the firmware in flash memory or EEPROM chips that can be updated after the computer has been sold. Once Intel started producing chips for use on non-PC hardware such as Macintoshes, a successor to the legacy BIOS system was required and is called the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI). Although EFI provides a number of improvements over the traditional BIOS, it has not yet gained market dominance on PC’s. Is There a BIOS on Mac OS X? Prior to the production of Mac computers using x86 or Intel chips during the later portion of the 2000’s and their use of EFI, OpenFirmware was the BIOS equivalent on all Macintosh computers. OpenFirmware provides similar functionality on a Mac as the BIOS and EFI do on other computing systems. It conducts tasks such as locating attached or installed hardware and uses environment variables to direct the boot process for the Mac. To access the interface for OpenFirm, press the power button on the mac for about 10 seconds. While pressing the power button, simultaneously depress the “CMD,” “OPT,” “O,” and “F” keys once you hear an audible “chime.” Once you are done with the required modifications in OpenFirmware, exit the interface by typing “bye”, “boot”, or “mac-boot” (depends on the version of Mac computer you are using) followed by pressing the “return” key. How to Rest a BIOS Password By Using a Hash Code A lot of the major computer manufacturers use a master password generated from a hash code to reset the master BIOS password. This hash code is normally calculated from a unique equipment identifier such as the Serial Number, Service Tag, System ID, or Express Service Code. On many brands of computer, the identifying code will be displayed after the BIOS password has been entered incorrectly three times in a row. On other brands, it may be printed on the computer. On some HP models of computer, the hash code will only display if the “F2” or “F12” keyboard function key is press prior to entering the incorrect password a third time. A free service provided by Tech FAQ (other websites will charge you) is our BIOS password generation tool. The tool is designed to make a BIOS password that will work on many computer brands to include: Compaq, Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, HP, Samsung, and Sony models. The tool has also worked for many white-label PC’s running Phoenix or Insyde BIOS. Tech-FAQ.com recommends end users that desire to reset the BIOS password for their respective computer try the hashcode generator before paying another company money to conduct the same task. Many times, third party companies will simply charge individuals upwards of $40 USD to obtain the same information provided for free here: BIOS Password Generator Tool Following generated passwords may help: Some Dell laptops and computers require you to press CTRL + Enter and on some is enough to just press enter Finding the Backdoor BIOS Password In addition to creating a BIOS password from a hash code, a number of BIOS manufacturers also implement an explicit backdoor password. This password will work regardless of the presence of a manually set BIOS password. The primary purpose of a manufacturer’s backdoor BIOS password is for maintenance and testing evolutions. These passwords are changed periodically by the respective company and success will vary across brand and age of computer. The reported BIOS backdoor passwords to date include: Manufacturer BIOS Password AMI A.M.I., AAAMMMIII, AMI?SW , AMI_SW, BIOS, CONDO, HEWITT RAND, LKWPETER, MI, Odor, and PASSWORD.

CmosPWD  is a free application that can be used to retrieve and decrypt the BIOS password. It also provides backup, restoral, and erasing capabilities. The program is proven to work with the following BIOS types: ACER/IBM BIOS AMI BIOS AMI WinBIOS 2.5 Award 4.5x/4.6x/6.0 Compaq (1992) Compaq (New version) IBM (PS/2, Activa, Thinkpad) Packard Bell Phoenix 1.00.09.AC0 (1994), a486 1.03, 1.04, 1.10 A03, 4.05 rev 1.02.943, 4.06 rev 1.13.1107 Phoenix 4 release 6 (User) Gateway Solo – Phoenix 4.0 release 6 Toshiba Zenith AMI   How to Reset the BIOS Password By Removing the CMOS Battery One of the most common methods to reset the BIOS password is to remove or discharge the battery on the computer’s motherboard. If the power to the battery is lost or drained, the BIOS configuration will be reset to the factory state with no password. System settings made to the BIOS will also be lost. Step 1 – Turn off the computer and ensure it has no external power (ie unplug the power cable. If it has a battery, remove it). Step 2 – Open the computer’s case or box. Step 3 – Locate the computer’s motherboard and look for the white silver button battery on the motherboard. Step 4 – If the battery is not soldered to the motherboard, remove it carefully and wait for approximately 30 seconds. Step 5 – Put the computer case back together and boot the computer. Step 6 – If the “CMOS Checksum Error-Defaults Loaded” error message is displayed, the BIOS password has been reset. In the event the CMOS battery is soldered to the computer’s motherboard, you will want to seek a different method to reset the BIOS password on the computer. Steps to Reset the BIOS Password Using Hardware If the CMOS battery is soldered to the computer’s motherboard, some brands will have a jumper located on the board that can be used to reset or clear the BIOS password. The location of the jumper on the motherboard will be contained in the motherboard documentation. If you can not find documentation on which jumper will reset the BIOS password, some users will guestimate on which jumper is the appropriate by choosing the one closest to the battery for reset. Another option is to short the points of the battery connection pins to the motherboard (when there is no power being applied to the computer). Steps to Reset the BIOS Password Using the Real Time Clock If attempts at resetting the CMOS battery through removal or by jumper fail, another method is to reset the Real Time Clock (RTC) Integrated Circuit (IC) on the computer’s motherboard. This method will work if the RTC requires an external battery. To reset, simply remove the RTC from the motherboard socket with no power available to the computer and reseat. The RTCs reported to require external batteries include: Dallas Semiconductor DS12885S TI benchmarq bq3258S Motorola MC146818AP Hitachi HD146818AP Samsung KS82C6818A If the RTC contains an integrated battery, it can typically be reset by shorting two of the pins for several seconds after power has been removed from the system.

How to Turn Off the BIOS Password Once end-users obtain the master BIOS password for the target computer, a common task to accomplish is making the computer stop asking for the password when restarted or rebooted. Step 1 – Restart your computer. Step 2 – Press the BIOS access key during computer restart (F2 on many models, Tech-FAQ listing of common BIOS access keys). Step 3 – Use the keyboard arrow keys to locate the security tab in the BIOS setup. Step 4 – Locate the submenu that lists menu items similar to: Supervisor password is: set User password is: set Step 5 – Use the keyboard arrow key to navigate to the available options and press the first password setting. Step 6 – Enter the current BIOS password in the subsequently displayed menu prompt. Some BIOS types will ask for the password to be entered twice. Step 7 – Change the password setting to blank, not set, etc. Step 8 – Repeat steps 5-7 for the subsequent password options that indicate they are “set.” Step 9 – Navigate to the BIOS “exit” menu option and choose the “save changes” menu option. Step 10 – Continue to exit from the BIOS setup and restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Please use the password generator tool above before asking for password in the comments.

The Acer company or any other PC company is in the Business of making money.But they know how to fix the Bios Password Issue too. And I will show you how it is done. The Acer Boys use a DOS Software called “Bios Password Cleaner” It’s on a bootdisk that also has a HDD Lockout Password Generator on it. all you need to remove the Password is the Software. The name is “clnpwd.exe” How do you get it you ask? Here is what you do,and it’s so easy! I encourage you to do this: 1. Google it 2. look for a file called “clnpwd.zip” 3.If you can’t find it here is the link: hxxp://www.mediafire.com/?6g4v2q2yvo173q9 4. download it and unzip the file. 5. You find more Dos files in it that you can use if you want to make a Floppy Boot disk, but most PC’s don’t have a Floppy Drive anymore ,so you will need a Dos 7.1 Bootdisk. It is a MS-DOS 7.10 LiveCD / BootCD for BIOS Flashing Here is a link to the Dos 7.1 Bootdisk iso file: hxxp://depositfiles.com/files/5000144 Download the Password protected file and extract it with Password “123” 1. Use an ISO image editor to open the ISO file (I use UltraISO). 2. Place all your DOS File “clnpwd.exe into the FLASH folder. You may want to delete the folder’s contents first. 3. Burn ISO image to disc. 4. Boot directly to disc. 5. Select option 1 to launch MS-DOS. 6. When “A:\>” appears, type “C:”. 7. When “C:\>” appears, type “cd FLASH\” 8. When “C:\FLASH\>” appears, type:”clnpwd.exe” 9. Follow the on screen instructions to delete the Supervisor and or User Password by pressing 1 or 2. Now reboot your PC and when you press F2 the Password dialog will not appear. “A message given in Fear holds little Truth.” “A message given in Love leads you to the Answer.” Dogbert Laptops are little bit more tricky: in most cases, there isn’t a reset jumper or a working default password. Still, most vendors have implemented bypass mechanisms which I reverse-engineered: http://dogber1.blogspot.com/2009/05/table-of-reverse-engineered-bios.html Ron so Toshiba posts on their web site that commonly the computer will not start due to a password reset issue on the cmos. They state they will no longer repair this under warranty and charge 170.00 for the cmos reset password. Something is wrong with this. Nobody informed us of this issue before we spent our money even though they knew of it.  We appreciate all you have done to help us but short of some Toshiba tech recognizing that the company is acting in poor confidence therefor volunteering the password under the table, I think we have a new target for the kids to shoot at. I will never again support Toshiba. yours in disgust Ron Adam Hi Ron, I’m a broke college student experiencing the same difficulties with toshiba. My laptop is a huge part of my life since so much of our class work needs to be done through the Internet. If you could please help me that would be amazing!

Laptop was pre loaded with Vista  and bios was password protected. I followed directions on my link and it worked like a charm. Then once booted up nothing but a black screen with a blinking cursor at top left. I then tried to use recovery cd’s to restore but would quit responding on disc one. I then used XP Pro to wipe drive and loaded new partition with XP Pro. My next step then was to use the Vista recovery cd’s again and this time it.   worked. I’m thinking made some registry problems and wiping then putting XP pro fixed and allowed for a clean recovery from cd. Hope this may help someone 🙂   BTW my laptop was not same model as his in video but was lucky enough to have same setup from which i believe would be the case with most models.

This works with Texas Instruments RTCs but shoul;d work with any with an internal battery. The cold causes the battery to supply insufficient current to maintain the settings.

Allison Hi, I have a Toshiba Qosmio laptop and it’s always worked fine till recently, instead of starting up it goes straight to a screen that says ENTER PASSWORD: ______ … when pressing F2 during the initial startup it takes me to a similar page though it says “Phoenix SecureCore(tm) Startup Utility ENTER PASSWORD: _____ …” I’ve come to understand it’s asking of a BIOS password, but I have no way of disabling bios, and any password I’ve tried has failed me. Three failed attempts and the computer kicks me and shuts off. I’ve tried looking around the web for a few weeks now trying to figure it out, calling tech support etc and well nothing has worked. This is probably the most reliable page I’ve come too yet, but I’m still quite stuck. If there’s any way you can help please message me, I will be very grateful. — allisonbarbas@yahoo.com. Thanks!

If the code appears to confirm the password is correct are there any other suggestions? Thank you. As yet I have unable to satisfactorily short the RTC pins Will.Spencer With the Samsung N150, you have have to remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard and wait for a few minutes before replacing it. Robert Davidson Well, I have a Toshiba Satellite L755D-S5204 with insyde h2 bios. When I turn on the computer I tried pressing F2 or F12 to get to bios or the boot manager and instead I’m presented with a black background and a blue box that says ‘Enter Password’ After 3 attempts, it says ‘Verify error!!

Here’s all we get: http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201303/20130314150729559/Dos_Manual_eng.pdf Because of this, the options are either to open the notebook and look for a RTC reset jumper or to call Samsung support.

Advent supplies a user manual for the 7113 on the “Notebook Utility CD” that came with your system. Do you have that CD? Advent doesn’t seem to have a web site where you can download the manual, but since the Advent 7113 is just a rebranded Uniwill L5II you can download the manual here: http://www.uniwill.com/UserDownload/l51ii/l51ii.php Emilio Cerón Excuse me. For unlock BIOS ‘One Time Password’ of Sony Vaio Model VPCZ110GL? WillSpencer Emilio: What is the code that your Sony prints after you enter the password incorrectly three times?

Your Service Tag should be a 7 digit number.

I’ve located the battery as in the immage below, but I don’t know where the jumper is. Thank you WillSpencer Instead of searching for a jumper, I’d remove the battery to delete the BIOS settings. Read the article section “How to Reset the BIOS Password By Removing the CMOS Battery” for tips. Matt Well, I didn’t want to unsoldered it. Anyway, thank you for your suggestion. WillSpencer Ahh… from the picture I could not see that it was soldered on — it looked like it was held on just by a pressure clip. How about shorting the points of the battery connection pins to the motherboard (when there is no power being applied to the computer)? Matt I did unsoldered the battery and solder it back… and also shorting the battery points, but didn’t work. Still my laptop is “dead” WillSpencer What do you mean “dead”? Matt Won’t power on. WillSpencer I am confused. “Won’t power on” is not a symptom of a BIOS password problem. Matt IT was working fine until I started to update BIOS and it took a long time. I left it on the table and when I came back it was off. Since then, it won’t turned on anymore. WillSpencer The common slang for systems which crash during BIOS updates is “bricked”. It means the motherboard is now “functional as a brick”. I see a replacement motherboard on eBay for $68.95: http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-Toshiba-Satellite-A350-A355-Intel-Motherboard-K000069530-KTKAA-LA-4571P-/390592312203 H3llas Try this: look for the B500 or XXX jumper, it should be somewhere around ram memory. Short one of those out for a couple of second… Those worked on old Toshibas. Matt I will try this one as the last attempt to power on my laptop. Thank you for your suggestion. H3llas Since you can’t power on your laptop, judging about comments bellow, I can say this will not work for sure. If your computer stuck while updating bios then you will need professional help to fix it. Oinam My laptop is singtech i forgot bios password and hash code is F34D5973 , plz tell me the password WillSpencer Oinam: Try 14415100. H3llas Hmm. I think that one is tricky.

WillSpencer Marko: I’m confused. The picture you posted doesn’t show a BIOS password problem. It shows that your BIOS configuration has been lost.

Computer will then restart. RTC is located on the right side of the RAM memory utors as you can see on the picture.

Remove the RAM cover, and on the underlying DIP switch (S3) put switch number 4 to ON for about a minute. Adis this model dont have dip switches this is newer model with petium dual cpu T2050(i think) H3llas Hmm there is in total 12 supersonic models.

I tried 3 times and got the system disabled message with code 318C10060000000000 . I tried the generator and got 2 codes ‘Samsung’ and ‘p12’. Am I doing something wrong. I’ve tried both but they don’t work. Any assistance would be appreciated. H3llas It’s just p12. Do you get different code or the same one when the system is disabled next time? tj I got a different code the first time. It was 233201180000000000 but the generator gave me the same password p12 and it didn’t work tj Hi, Just got it sorted. The password ‘p12’ was correct. It was the keyboard that was faulty. I connected a usb keyboard and typed in the password ‘p12’ and it worked fine. The bios password has now been cleared. Thanks for the advice. H3llas Great to hear you sorted it out. Char Brown Hi I have a hp pavilion dv2000 and the disabled code is 01982 I brought off a person online and iv tryd to contact the for the password but they wont contact me back so if you cauld help me out that would be great WillSpencer Char: Try putting the serial number from your HP into our BIOS password generator. The serial number is printed on the underside of the notebook. If that doesn’t work, you’ll have to open your notebook and temporarily remove the CMOS battery. Instructions for doing so can be found in section 5-5 (page 125) of the HP Pavilion dv2000 Notebook PC Maintenance and Service Guide: http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01035657.pdf Char Brown Willspencer..thank you I tried putting the serial number in and it came back with 2 codes but they r both too long..and the cmos battery is fastend to the laptop and I cant figure out how to get it off without breaking it WillSpencer Char: What is the serial number?

PLEASE HELP ME .. I NEED PASSWORD FOR TOSHIBA SATELLITE C640 .. CANT BOOT ANYTHING. ITS DIRECTLY TO THE PASSWORD WHEN STARTING.. H3llas I have no clue for Toshibas. I guess new bios chip or Toshiba support might help you… Sami Alam Need your help H3llas, been at this for days. I have a Sony Vaio PCG-71912L (VPCEH1AFX) which needs a BIOS password. I’ve tried the password generators for the older Sony Vaio but they don’t work on mine, I can’t seem to get any help(even from Sony). Using the last 7 digits of the S/N doesn’t work on mine, that is for older models. After 3 failed attempts I get a 16 digit(4×4) code that needs to be converted into a one time password. The code I currently have up is 7T73-2J6J-FP98-R7T3. Please tell me you have the new script to convert this. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Sami Alam That last 4×4 code is no longer valid because I had to shut down the laptop. If you or WillSpencer can help then please contact me and I will generate a new code the same day you reply. As you know the code changes every time you reboot. Thanks. superdave007 Hi Sami, Any luck yet? I’ve got a newer Sony with a similar 4×4 code for onetime password that I’m stuck on. Did you get a private message with assistance or are you still stuck too? Sami Alam Didn’t get any assistance with it but it turns out that the previous owner had set a personal BIOS password and I was able to get that from her. I hope someone is able to help you with yours, sucks not being able to do anything because of BIOS password. TJ Hey man, thanks for the Article.

Sorry i did gorget to mention Matt Hi I have Fujitsu H700 and when entering password wrong 3 times I don’t get any checksum, just loud beeping:) Do you have any solution? BTW Great blog! smic18 try to enter these three specific passwords “3hqgo3″,”jqw534″,”0qww294e” Nighter I have a GIGABYTE GA-F2A55M-HD2 CHIP MATX FM2 MOTHERBOARD. And while I was in the BIOS settings, somehow I accidentally set a BIOS password for it, while apparently requiring me to enter it right when I power it on. Meaning I can’t get to Windows, Can’t get to the BIOS settings, or well anything else. Right when I turn it on, it shows “Enter Password” and a box under it to enter. Nothing else shows up, at all. And the only thing I’ve found that does anything to it, is “CTRL+ALT=DEL” which all that does is reset’s it when I’ve typed on 3 password guesses. I’ve tried removing the CMOS battery already, didn’t work. Can’t find any other type of thing like the 3 pings, cause they aren’t there. I have found the “CLEAR CMOS” and all that other stuff on the Motherboard, and a bunch of places where the pings are post to be, but aren’t, and are just blank. If you were to give me a method on how to fix it, it’d be really helpful for me. baptist HI, All, I have Compaq 6735s laptop.. it is having bios password. help to remove the same.. kamil Hi, i need a bios password for a HP dv6-3004so Ari Hello I would appreciate very much if I could get Admin password for Dell Latitude E5510 (CZZJHP1-2A7B).

When I received it the BIOS had a password set so I disassembled the laptop and unplugged the CMOS battery. After doing that I have two issues I need to fix. The first one is after the initial boot after removing the CMOS battery I am able to access the BIOS without needing a password but after rebooting it asks for a password again. The second issue is when I try to boot into windows 7 I now get a BSOD 0x0000007B (perhaps it is a setting in the BIOS causing this). Anyone have any ideas?

That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Moore’s Second Law sucks. Everyone knows Moore’s Law. The idea, first propounded in an Electronics Magazine article 50 years ago by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) co-founder Gordon Moore, is that semiconductors can get twice as dense, and twice as fast, every 18 months, doubling their price-performance. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr Moore’s Law drives the technology economy, but few acknowledge what I call Moore’s Second Law, which is that the cost of the gear needed to make chips will also multiply as circuit densities increase. Moore’s Second Law has driven the vast majority of chip companies out of the manufacturing end of the business. It needs to drive Intel out, too. The way to do that would be to split the company into two parts. One would be dedicated to designing and selling semiconductors, which is mainly a function of software and dealing with customers who design products. The other would be dedicated to making them, which is a function of capital and dealing with customers that need chips. It’s the one logical step Intel management has fiercely resisted … that it has flatly rejected. 9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in the Long Run Shareholders have suffered enough. Consider ARM Holdings ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ:ARMH) competes directly with Intel in microprocessors, but doesn’t really compete with it at all. The British company was acquired by Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS:SFTBF) in September for $32 billion, but for many years before that it had been running rings around its larger rival, delivering shareholders a 10-year gain of over 950% while Intel’s performance ware barely half that of the NASDAQ Composite. The secret of ARM’s success was that it only sold chip designs. Other companies, like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), bought the designs, tweaked them to their specifications, then had companies like Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) manufacture them. The customers got a custom design for a competitive price. INTC stock had similar problems in the mobile space, where Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) ran rings around it for years. Intel tried to sell chips and showed Chinese OEMs software that would work with the chips. Broadcom sold designs the OEMs could quickly get to market and sell. Since Broadcom, like ARM Holdings, wasn’t responsible for the economics of manufacture, it wasn’t selling a one-size-fits-all solution. As PCs have become less important, INTC has suffered from its lack of flexibility. Profit margins have plummeted and debt levels have increased. INTC stock has become a yield stock, one bought for its dividend, currently yielding 3.1%, but for the quarter ending in July, that dividend ate an alarming part of Intel’s earnings. A crisis is at hand.

Blog Support Store Developer Get Involved Archive Switching from macOS: Hardware This is part 4 of an ongoing “Switching from macOS” series. Yesterday I wrote about elementary OS for Creative Work. In the Apple world, you have one choice for hardware: whatever Apple makes. With elementary OS, your options are far more vast; you can get anything from a tiny thin low-power notebook to massive powerful workstation and use elementary OS. Existing Mac hardware The simplest option if you are switching from macOS, however, is to use your existing Mac hardware. Apple’s modern MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iMac, and Mac Pro are all Intel-based computers and should work well with elementary OS. Avi Romanoff, an elementary contributor has written up a guide for installing elementary OS on a Mac. Dedicated Vendors If you are looking for new hardware and Apple’s latest doesn’t interest you, there are several companies shipping great computers with elementary OS out of the box. Tuxedo sells several machines with elementary OS, and their InfinityBook is probably the closest to a MacBook Air or Pro: thin, light, aluminum, and backlit. It comes in 13” and 15” options which both look great. Another option is Slimbook, who offers a couple of similarly thin, light, aluminum models that can ship with elementary OS out of the box. Obsidian PC has several models as with an elementary OS option as well. Likely to Work Well There has been an uptick in recent years of companies making and shipping computers with Linux-based OSes out of the box. System76 is probably the biggest and most popular of these; I’d be comfortable recommending any of their laptops or desktops for an elementary OS user. Because elementary OS is Ubuntu based and System76 fanatically supports Ubuntu (with hardware selection, firmware development, and driver tweaks specifically designed to work perfectly with Ubuntu), it works great. Other companies ship and support Linux-based OSes around the world like Dell, Entroware, and many others. If they’re excited about supporting Linux and support Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based OSes, elementary OS should work as well. General Hardware Suggestions If you’re wanting or willing to spend the time researching several companies or even building your own computer to run elementary OS, there are a number of guidelines we recommend you follow. Modern 64-bit Intel-based processors (Core i3, i5, and i7) and Intel HD graphics are your best bet. While NVIDIA and AMD may have Linux drivers, they can be more hit or miss than Intel. We recommend at least 1 GB of RAM, but realistically 4 GB is a good minimum for a modern computer, and more is always better. Some WiFi cards can be hit or miss; again, Intel is typically your best bet, but if it works with Ubuntu or more broadly, Linux, it should work perfectly in elementary OS. Otherwise, if you’re unsure about specific hardware support, searching if it works with Ubuntu is a good bet. Since elementary OS is based on the same core and hardware stack as Ubuntu, hardware support is almost identical. You can see all of our official hardware recommendations at our Installation Guide.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although expensive, are not really overpriced.  Head-to-head: Spectre x360 vs. 13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech:   Spectre x360  13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar  Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz. It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.  Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.  The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.  Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.  We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Business Technology Is Google Fiber going wireless for the last mile? Google Fiber has paused the rollout of new cities for its high speed Internet service while its explores other technology options. Reuters Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A key hurdle to widespread gigabit-speed Internet is the high cost of getting fiber optic lines over the last mile -- from the fiber backbone in nearby streets to each house. But increasingly, cellular operators, broadband providers including Google Fiber and several startups are exploring a new, less expensive way to bridge the last mile gap – wireless technology. Google Fiber – which named San Diego as a potential city for building an ultra-fast fiber optic Internet network -- said last month that it would pause future fiber optic roll outs in San Diego and seven other potential Google Fiber cities while it explored new approaches.  Among those is wireless, including high frequency airwaves, which can deliver gigabit data rates over short, line of sight distances but also tend to bounce erratically off obstacles and degrade in rain or fog. “Millimeter wave is one of several different technologies (Google Fiber) is looking at, but it does seem to have the most promise,” said Karl Bode of broadband watchdog DSL Reports. “There are line of sight issues here, and weather can impact signal,” he continued.  “As such you need transmitters relatively close to the home, meaning you still have some notable deployment costs. Still, that's cheaper than digging up streets, which is why Google is interested.” Don’t expect Google Fiber to incorporate wireless into fiber networks anytime soon. There are still many questions about how viable wireless can be, and what licenses would be required from federal regulators in various airwave bands. But recent improvements in antenna technology and beam forming techniques to more precisely steer these high frequency airwaves are fueling optimism about their ability to span the last mile. Certain high frequency airwaves have been earmarked to become part of the spectrum dedicated for upcoming gigabit class 5G cellular networks. Last week, Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam spoke at the Intel Capital Global Summit in San Diego about the bandwidth capabilities of millimeter wave 5G technology, calling it “wireless fiber,” according to Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel’s mobile and Internet of things group. “I think he said 50 percent of his costs in a fiber roll-out is from the lamp post to the home,” said Renduchintala. “So he’s basically saying if I can get high-speed ‘wireless fiber’ to the house, it would make deployments much more rapid and much more economically viable.” Verizon built its FiOS fiber optic TV and Internet network in nine states but stopped expanding into new markets in 2010, in part because of high installation costs. In October, San Diego’s Qualcomm said it would deliver the first 5G mobile modem chip, called the Snapdragon X50, next year for testing. It expects to reach top-end download speeds of 5 gigabits per second when shows up in commercial devices in 2018. Qualcomm is targeting the X50 for mobile handsets. But analysts think that “fixed wireless” markets – such as boxes that link the fiber optic backbone in the street to individual homes  – also are potential uses of this technology. With five gigabits of bandwidth, users could download an entire digital movie in less than a minute.  Skyriver, a San Diego start-up, recently completed field trials for millimeter wave point-to-multi-point technology to fuel gigabit broadband. The company said it has been acquiring spectrum rights in millimeter wave bands in several markets. For Google, affordable bandwidth is the key to its Web businesses such as Google search and YouTube. In 2012, it got into the Internet Service Provider business with Google Fiber. Today 12 cities nationwide either have Google Fiber up and running or are in development. Google has worked with these cities to install fiber on existing power poles, among other things, to keep costs down. The company’s entrance into the high speed Internet business has spurred on cable and telecom competitors to ramp their fiber optic roll outs – though most have limited expansion to new housing developments. Google has been talking with eight additional cities – San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, Portland, Phoenix, Chicago, Jacksonville and Tampa – as the next potential markets for Google Fiber expansion. Last month, it put those plans on hold, raising concern that it had lost its enthusiasm for Google Fiber. . In its third quarter earnings conference call, Google/Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the company will continue to be an Internet Service Provider in the 12 existing cities where fiber is deployed or in the development pipeline.  “We are making great progress in those cities, and we remain very committed to growth across those cities,” she said. “We are pausing for now our work in eight cities where we have been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it is to better integrate some of the technology work we have been developing.” The company is still talking with San Diego officials about permitting, micro trenching and other issues, said Stacey LoMedico, San Diego’s assistant chief operating officer.  A meeting was held earlier this week. The two sides have not yet talked about wireless, said LoMedico. Last year, Google purchased San Francisco based Webpass, which uses point-to-point microwave to deliver high speed Internet to urban apartment buildings, condo complexes and businesses in San Diego and five other cities. The company is licensed in the 70/80 Gigahertz spectrum bands, according to a Google spokesperson. It installs large antennas on top of buildings to deliver point-to-point Internet. Its then distributes bandwidth to each apartment or office. “In San Diego, Google Fiber and Webpass will work together to extend and accelerate deployments via point-to-point wireless,” said a Google spokesperson in an email. “In addition as we’ve said, we’re actively expanding our roadmap to include innovative technologies like fixed wireless that expand access to more people, faster.” A key question is how far can a high bandwidth wireless signal travel to connect the fiber node to homes? Some companies have claimed the signals can travel a bit over a mile (about two kilometers) in tests. But industry analysts think it’s unlikely to be that far in actual deployments. “I don’t think there will be any trouble going a couple hundred meters, but I think a lot of engineers are trying to figure this out,” said Christopher Taylor, director of radio frequency/wireless components at industry research firm Strategy Analytics.   Three must-see headlines <h1>Gunman killed by police shot City Heights family, took hostage</h1> <h1>Cellphone crud could help I.D. crime victims</h1> <h1>CEO in San Diego resigns after online threat to shoot Trump</h1> Gunman killed by police shot City Heights family, took hostage Cellphone crud could help I.D. crime victims CEO in San Diego resigns after online threat to shoot Trump See more videos mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com;  Twitter:@TechDiego 760-529-4973 Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 64°
Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel X299 Chipset Platform To Power Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Processors By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 weeks ago 108Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel’s next generation chipset to power their HEDT (High-End Desktop Platform) has been confirmed as X299. The chipset will be used to power entire platforms that will support the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPU family. Intel X299 HEDT Chipset To Power Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Based Platforms Intel launched their X99 chipset platform back in 2014. This platform features support for Haswell-E and Broadwell-E processors. The platform utilized a new socket known as LGA 2011-3. Now, Intel plans to be delivering an update to their HEDT platform in the form of X299. The move to switch to X299 doesn’t come as a surprise as Intel would like to push their HEDT platform in the 200-series branding. Intel would be using the 200-series branding for all PCH’s (Platform Control Hubs) on the mainstream lineup hence it makes sense from a marketing perspective to keep parity, following the same 200 series naming scheme as the rest of the chipsets. Intel X299 chipset will not only be replacing the X99 chipset, but it would also introduce a new socket. The new socket will be required to support Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors. We have known this socket as LGA 2066. The name reveals that the socket will feature exactly 2066 pins. This is an increase of 55 pins from the previous socket. Since Skylake is architecturally different than Haswell and Broadwell, it was necessary to make the shift. The new socket will span at least three generations of processors, Skylake, Kaby Lake and Cannonlake. Intel will only need to update it when they introduce their Ice Lake architecture based processors which would be around 2020. That new socket would be known as LGA 2076, more details on that here. Intel Is Giving The Disabled Another Chance At Life With Exoskeletons That Allow Them To Walk Once More Intel Skylake-X HEDT Processors For X299 Chipset The Intel Skylake-X family is a new name for Skylake-E which is built for high-end desktop PCs. The family will be aimed at enthusiasts and will be launching in 2H 2017. The Skylake-X chips will be replacing the Broadwell-E family which launched a few months ago. Advertisement Information suggests that Skylake-X processors will be available in same core configuration as Broadwell-E with 10, 8 and 6 core variants and TDP’s adjusted around 140W while delivering better IPC with the new Skylake architecture. We can expect similar if not higher pricing structure for these processors. Intel Kaby Lake-X HEDT Processors For X299 Chipset Intel would also be offering Kaby Lake-X processors on their HEDT platform. They would launch at the same time as Skylake-X but available in only Quad Core package. The surprising thing here is that the Kaby Lake-X SKUs will feature a 112W TDP on a 14nm node. This means that we might be looking at much higher clock speeds compared to current generation quad core models. In fact, the Kaby Lake family uses a more optimized architecture compared to Skylake which will allow Intel to finer tune its performance for better performance and efficiency. The Kaby Lake-X series of processors feature up to 16 PCI-E Gen 3.0 lanes. It’s odd to see Intel splitting Kaby Lake “Unlocked” Quad Cores on mainstream and HEDT platforms but it kind of makes sense too. While LGA 1151 (Z270) will have its set of unlocked flagships, HEDT users will be allowed an entry level product that will allow them to upgrade later onward or take advantage of multiple PCI-e lanes that will be offered on X299. Some other details about the Basin Falls-X platform includes quad channel memory support on Skylake-X and dual channel memory support on Kaby Lake-X processors. Speeds as high as 2667 MHz are supported by these chips. The Kaby Lake-X PCH itself offers 24 PCI-E Gen 3.0 lanes along with 10 USB 3.0, 8 USB 2.0 ports and Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) chipset.

Whats with the everyone's rush to get newer CPU, honestly can't see need for it when already maximum settings in game 1080P? Or is it just an epeen thing to post better benchmarks in synthetic benchmark apps to boast? This is not a troll post, Its coming from a gaming perspective. I am not using this PC for anything else (pr0n doesn't count ) so high values for synthetic benchmarks or compressing 3d rendering software are irrelevant.

On X58 I've been for very long time and I needed get something to try and to compare there Hope this helps Thanks,Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11   (#3) Sir Galahad Master Guru     Videocard: EVGA GTX 980 Classified Processor: 4690K 4.5GHz 1.25v H110 Mainboard: Asus Maximus VII Ranger Memory: 16GB Corsair VenPro 2400 Soundcard: Creative SB ZXR+Sen HD560 PSU: Corsair AX860i 11-05-2016, 18:41 | posts: 422 | Location: England If it's running ok for you then you don't need to upgrade no matter what anyone tells you. After all it's your PC not ours. Upgrade when you think the time is right. On another note. I kept my old Q9650 @ 4GHz as my main gaming PC from 2008 up until mid 2014. At that time the Q9650 was starting to struggle with some games that came out at the time. It was ok, I was going down to 40FPS though is some games and for me that's as low as I can bare so I upgraded to the 4690K I have now. However some more recent games have ran really well on the Q9650 (I still have the PC up and running with GTX970). Doom on vulkan is amazing, maxed out at 1080p it gets over 100fps in most situations. I'm now beginning to regret upgrading when I did as there is still plenty of life left in the Q9650 and I could have held out a little longer and bought something newer and better.     Sir Galahad View Public Profile Find all posts by Sir Galahad « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. We’ll continue to post updates with new Thunderbolt™ 3 product and release information as it becomes available. Thunderbolt™ 3 brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at speeds up to 40 Gb/s, creating one compact port that does it all – delivering the fastest, most versatile connection to any dock, display, or data device. For the first time, one computer port connects to Thunderbolt devices, every display, and billions of USB devices. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying power. IMPORTANT Your PC may need updates for the Thunderbolt 3 ports to function properly. For more information go to https://thunderbolttechnology.net/updates Plugable’s line of Thunderbolt 3 products Flagship Thunderbolt 3 dock for Windows and Mac (Plugable TBT3-UDV) Expected Q1 2017 Plugable’s new Thunderbolt 3 Dock will eliminate the need to constantly plug and unplug multiple devices to your notebook or tablet. The dock’s anodized aluminum enclosure and black bezel design can be positioned horizontally or vertically. Connect two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) displays (one via a DisplayPort++ port and the other via the 2nd USB-C port), up to three USB 3.0 devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and stereo audio in/out all while creating a more productive and clutter free workspace. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock supports up to 5 daisy chained Thunderbolt 3 devices, up to 128 USB 3.1 (10Gb/s) devices, or the second DisplayPort display. Supports USB Power Delivery (PD) 2.0 with support for charging compatible laptops and tablets up to 60W. Note that PD support is system dependent — only certain computers will charge via the USB-C connector. Volume Thunderbolt 3 dock (Plugable TBT3-UD1) Expected October 2016, Estimated street price $179 USD Postponed indefinitely for MacBook Pro 2016 compatibility All the same functionality as our flagship dock, with charging limited to 15W (5V 3A) to the host laptop or tablet. Gigabit Ethernet (Network Connection) USB 3.0 (USB Peripherals) Audio Line In (Microphone) Audio Line Out (Headphones / Speakers) Identical to #6 Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C 3.1 Gen2. Connect one port to host Computer and second port to any Thunderbolt 3 or USB device DisplayPort++ (Additional Display) Power In (12V DC / 6A) USB 3.0 (USB Peripherals) USB-C 3.1 Gen1 (USB devices only, does not support Thunderbolt devices or VESA Alternate Mode video output) Thunderbolt 3 HDMI Dual-Display Adapter for Windows (Plugable TBT3-HDMI2X) Launched May 2016, Windows Only, Estimated street price $99 USD Supports two HDMI monitors up to 4K 30Hz (3840 x 2160), uncompressed and at full GPU performance. Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPort Dual-Display Adapter for Windows (Plugable TBT3-DP2X) Launched May 2016, Windows Only, Estimated street price $89 USD Supports two DisplayPort monitors up to 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160), uncompressed and at full GPU performance. These are “native” DisplayPort ports, so conversion to HDMI or VGA can only be done with active adapters (not less expensive DP++ passive adapters). So generally we recommend this adapter for enthusiasts who who have chosen DisplayPort native monitors with the best possible performance and resolution in mind.

A: No. Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters will only work with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C computers and ports. Connecting to a USB-C port without Thunderbolt 3 capability will not work. Note that computers and docks may have a mix of Thunderbolt 3 and other USB-C ports that look very similar. Look for the Thunderbolt icon on both sides of the connection to ensure the port and device support Thunderbolt 3. Please note that existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals are not compatible with the MacBook Pro 2016.   Q: Are Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 cables compatible with the new 2016 MacBook Pro systems? A: Yes! Q: Are Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 devices compatible with the new 2016 MacBook Pro systems? A: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge).

So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. Q: Is Plugable planning on releasing any Thunderbolt 3 devices which are compatible with the 2016 MacBook Pros? A: Yes. Our upcoming Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station with Power Delivery (TBT3-UDV) will be compatible with Macs, and we’ve postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to evaluate adding MacBook compatibility. Q: What happens if I plug in an unsupported Thunderbolt 3 device into a 2016 MacBook? You will not receive any warnings or errors, but the device will not function. Examination of the device enumeration tree (System Information -> Hardware -> Thunderbolt -> Thunderbolt 3 Bus -> {Your Device Name}) will simply show {Your Device Name} – Unsupported Device Q: Will the Thunderbolt 3 dock charge my phone, tablet, or laptop with a USB-C cable? A: Thunderbolt 3 uses the standard charging methods available with the USB-C connector. Thunderbolt 3 certification also insures a minimum bar that Thunderbolt 3 ports must signal 5V 3A of available power, and handle up to 15W draw on that port. Optionally, hosts and devices may support the more complex USB Power Delivery (PD) specification, which would allow negotiation up to 100W per port. That’s the good news. The more complex site of the story is there is no requirement for laptops, tablets, or phones to use the USB-C port for charging. Some with USB-C ports will only charge via a DC barrel plug. Some will charge on USB-C, but only when connected to their own branded power adapters. Others may require a specific voltage during PD negotiation which don’t match any voltage offered by the power adapter, so the negotiation fails. And the PD spec is evolving from version 2 (current devices) to version 3 (devices later in 2016). Because of these factors, charging behavior is device specific. We will be providing tables with test results with the most common laptops, tablets, and phones when used with our Thunderbolt 3 and other USB-C docks. Q: I have a DisplayPort monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: Any Thunderbolt 3 dock or adapter with DisplayPort or DisplayPort++ ports will connect to DisplayPort monitors directly. If the monitor has only a mini-DisplayPort (mDP) connector, a DP to mDP adapter is needed. Q: I have a HDMI monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: The Plugable TBT3-HDMI2X adapter will support your HDMI monitor without additional adapters. For Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter (active or passive). Q: I have a VGA monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: For the Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter (active or passive). For Thunderbolt 3 dual-display adapters, your best choice is the dual-display HDMI adapter, with two active HDMI-to-VGA adapters like our $16.95 Plugable HDMI-VGA cable. Q: I have a DVI monitor. How can I connect it via Thunderbolt 3? A: For Thunderbolt 3 docks with a DisplayPort++ port, you can use it in combination with any DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter (active or passive). For Thunderbolt 3 dual-display adapters, your best choice is the dual-display HDMI adapter, which can then be combined with any passive HDMI to DVI cable.

Intel OpenCL Beignet 1.2.1 Released Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 November 2016 at 06:15 AM EDT. 4 Comments Intel's open-source team has announced the release of Beignet 1.2.1 as the newest version of their OpenCL GPU hardware implementation for Linux. Beignet 1.2.1 only ships bug fixes over Beignet 1.2.0 that was released back in August. Beignet 1.2.1 has various fixes such as adding some missing PCI IDs, runtime improvements, and more. No real new features for Beignet 1.2.1 as those are being saved for Beignet 1.3. There also is not yet any OpenCL 2.x support in Beignet while the OCL20 branch hasn't been updated now in five months. The changes for Beignet 1.2.1 can be found via their Git repository. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumored to Come Out Early in 2017 with a High-End Chipset and Running on Windows 10 Redstone 2, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 05, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Contrary to previous speculations that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out during the Microsoft event on October 26, the device was a no-show. The latest iteration of the combination laptop and tablet from the Redmondian company is now being rumored to be launched early next year with the high-end chipset in Intel’s Kaby Lake and possibly running on the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 that Microsoft just launched last month, notes News Everyday. The device shall also come out with an upgraded Surface Pen that can run on rechargeable batteries, which can be charged in a wireless mode since it is magnetically linked to the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Redstone 2 has been referred to as the Creator’s gadget, a software with the potential capability and much improved to Microsoft’s Edge, personalization capabilities, and adjustments to built-in apps. Faster and more optimal performance Having the Intel Kaby Lake processor also assures that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be faster and exude a more optimal performance, reports Game & Guide. It shall also feature a USB Type-C charging port, which has become the new paradigm in modern-day devices for faster data transfers. Based on its rumored specifications and features, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is going to be a spectacular piece of device when it finally arrives on the market next year. It shall reportedly come out with an improved Surface Pen, which will be an integral component of Microsoft Surface devices from thereon. According to analysts, one of the main reasons why the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was rumored to come out last month is because its predecessor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, completed its one-year market cycle also last month. But the same rumors are also consistent in saying that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be a lot better than the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 although based on the supposed leaked design of the upcoming device, the changes do not appear to be that much, externally that is. Simply not feasible While the Redmondian company would like nothing but to launch the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 last month, it later on became clear that it was not just possible and feasible since Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, which Microsoft intends to use for its hybrid laptop-tablet line, is due for mass production before the end of the year yet. The Kaby Lake processor was announced by Intel on August 30, 2016 but it began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of this year, Mass production is not expected to commence until late this year. Thus, it seems logical to assume that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out to the market sometime next year although no exact date has been given thus far. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is reported to be a power-efficient and very powerful processor that could double the performance of the hybrid laptop-tablet. One of the major problems of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, when it was launched last year, was its poor battery. The Intel Kaby Lake processor, in effect, fixes the battery issue on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 right off the bat. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall also be sporting a 4K Ultra HD display with an option for a lower-end variant with a 2K display. The devices shall feature 16GB of RAM, a rear-facing 16-megapixel camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. More than the name of the processor, what’s really interesting is the fact that Intel actually used 14-nanometer technologies in designing the Kaby Lake processor which means that it is more high-tech and more advanced. As such, it is also expected that the Kaby Lake processor shall bring about more impressive features for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Sarah Zhang. Sarah Zhang personal frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.31.16. 10.31.16 Time of Publication: 4:00 pm. 4:00 pm How Doctors Could One Day Use Your DNA to Cure You The Voorhes “I don’t mean to be morbid,” Eric Dishman told a friend as he was winding down his job at Intel. “But this may be the last time you see me.” Dishman, a longtime leader of the company’s health research division, was preparing to die. The kidney cancer he’d been diagnosed with in college had caught up to him two decades later. His kidneys had failed, and the chemo drug that kept him alive was incompatible with dialysis. Eric Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health.Joe PuglieseBut that friend happened to work for a DNA sequencing company, and he offered to analyze the genome of Dishman’s cancer cells. What could it hurt? Weeks later, Dishman got two 1-terabyte hard drives by courier, loaded with his genomic data. Another copy went to his doctors. And just days before he was to start dialy­sis—he already had the surgical port in his arm—his doctors called. Dishman’s kidney cancer mutations looked like they actually belonged to a form of pancreatic cancer. He switched to a drug designed for tumors in a totally different organ. It worked. Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a successful kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health. There, he’s in charge of recruiting 1 million Americans to share their DNA and medical histories for a massive study. As research like this pinpoints links between genetic variation and disease, doctors could someday look up a patient’s DNA and use it to prescribe custom treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Dishman’s case is still an anomaly. “I was ­triple lucky,” he says: lucky to have his DNA sequenced, lucky his doctors waded into the data, and lucky—most of all—that the information led to a cure. But Dishman hopes his million volunteers will help him discover more markers that lead to successful tailored treatments. And that would make the survival equation a little less luck and a lot more science. This article appears in our special November issue, guest-edited by President Barack Obama. Subscribe now.

The Asus ZenBook UX310UA is a premium and stylish 13.3-inch Ultrabook that doesn’t break the bank. With a starting price of just £550, this mid-range laptop comes with high-end features. These include a beautiful, thin and light metal-coated body, Intel Skylake processors, solid-state storage, a USB Type-C port and a backlit keyboard. Navigating Asus’ confusing naming conventions isn’t easy: the new UX310UA is the direct successor to the UX303UA (we gave this laptop a 4/5 back in February 2016). There isn’t a whole lot new here, and it isn’t perfect, but for the money the Asus ZenBook UX310UA is one of the most tempting laptops I’ve reviewed in quite some time. Its £800 price tag puts it in the same territory as the Lenovo IdeaPad 710S Trusted reviewed earlier this year, although the two offer slightly different experiences. With the MacBook Air seemingly abandoned by Apple, the Windows Ultrabook market is starting to look more promising than ever. Related: Best laptops to buy Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Buying Information With a retail price of £799.99, my review model is the top-spec UX310UA featuring a i7-6500U dual-core processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, 500GB secondary hard drive and a QHD+ resolution display. Considering the Dell XPS 13 costs £100 more for the base i5 Full HD model, I’m really impressed with what you get for your money. If you’re on a tighter budget, the entry-level UX310UA sports an i3-6100U processor, 4GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and a Full HD display. Related: Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 explained Here it's worth comparing the specifications of the top-end Lenovo IdeaPad 710S: For the same money you get a larger and faster 256GB SSD, better integrated graphics and a slightly faster Core i7-6560U processor. The IdeaPad is also slightly lighter, but only gets a Full HD screen. Watch: Trusted explains how to choose a laptop Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Design and Build There’s no fancy touchscreen or 360-degree hinge here – this is a traditional clamshell laptop. The UX301UA’s all-aluminium coating looks as premium as it feels. Weighing 1.45kg – that’s 550g lighter than the MacBook Pro 13 – and only 18mm thick, this is the ideal travel companion. Asus’ famous spun-metal finish on the lid looks great, catching the light as you open it. If you’re not a fan of the grey colour on review, the ZenBook is available in bronze and grey metal too. On the whole build quality is great, screen wobble is minimal, there’s very little flex in the metal body, and the keyboard depresses only slightly with a firm push. If I have one complaint, it’s that the chunky bezels detract from the high-end aesthetic of the laptop. Next to a Dell XPS 13 and its “infinity-edge” bezels, the UX310UA looks a little dated. It’s a minor gripe but something I’d like to see addressed on future models. As for ports, the UX310UA offers a peculiar combination of old and new. There are three USB ports, but only one of them is the faster USB 3.0 type. It’s odd to see two USB 2.0 ports on a 2016 laptop – although it isn’t much of an issue if you just use these to plug in mice, keyboards or other peripherals. The good news is the UX310UA does offer one of the latest reversible USB 3.1 (Type-C) ports, which is a nice piece of future-proofing. Elsewhere there’s a full-size HDMI port, headphone and microphone combo port, card reader and DC power port. It’s hard to think of anything that’s missing here. Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Keyboard and Touchpad The full-sized chiclet-style keyboard on the UX310UA is above average. While the keys do feel a little spongier than I‘d like, they offer a good amount of travel; I was comfortable typing on the keyboard within seconds of using it for the first time. It’s fully backlit, too – a feature the UX303 lacked – which not only adds to the laptop’s premium aesthetic but makes it easier to use in the dark. There’s a hint of flex in the keyboard if you press firmly toward the back-middle of the keyboard, but it isn’t something you’ll notice with normal use. The big, glass trackpad feels great. The smooth surface has two built-in buttons integrated into the bottom of the trackpad. I found it slightly less responsive than I’d like out of the box, but increasing the cursor sensitivity by a notch in Windows easily resolved the issue. Asus ZenBook UX310UA – Screen You have the choice of Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) or 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display, depending on which model of the UX310UA you go for. My review model sports the higher-resolution QHD+ panel, which looks terrific – but I’m not convinced that anyone needs it on a 13.3-inch laptop. You’ll definitely need to make use of Windows scaling (which actually works well in Windows 10) to make the text and icons comfortably usable. While I appreciate the sharpness (276ppi), unless you put the screen right up to your eye it isn’t something you’ll ever notice. I also believe it has a significant impact on battery life, but we’ll talk more about that later. What I do like is the IPS panel, which is bright and offers wide viewing angles. Whether you’re watching a Netflix movie, YouTube video or just browsing the web, the display is nice to look at. Asus’ quoted 500:1 contrast ratio is lower than average, and means blacks are less inky and whites are a tad duller than you might expect given the type of panel used. For the price, though, the screen is adequate. On the plus side, the solid 375cd/m2 maximum brightness combined with the matte panel makes it easy to use the UX310UA when you’re out and about. I found the display remained readable even in direct sunlight (hard to find during the Autumn in the UK).

Reuters/Danish Siddiqui The iMacs have always been a top favourite for numerous tech enthusiasts and they would love to see more of the powerful PC when the Apple iMac 2017 releases. An update seems imminent as it’s been a long time since the iMac has been updated. Macworld reported in October that US retailer Best Buy had accidentally listed a Kaby lake iMac on its website for sale. The listing was taken down soon. However, this raised hopes of thousands of Apple fans who desperately want to see the Kaby Lake chipset in the upcoming Apple iMac 2017. The potential refresh is coming and it could be in the first quarter of 2017. The Kaby Lake chipset is expected t bring awesome powers to the iMac 2017 and the processor will also be based on Intel’s Speed Shift V2 technology. Analysts are certain that the delay in the iMac release is primarily because of the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple may also be entering the VR race soon and what better way to do so than with the iMac 2017! There are talks that the iMac 2017 would be made VR capable as all major players are exploring VR capabilities for their gadgets and devices. The Apple iMac 2017 may have the Polaris 10 and 11 chipsets that are capable of providing decent VR experience. The Polaris graphics chips help in improving the resolution significantly and that’s particularly great for gamers, writes Tech Radar. Moreover, these chipsets are better than many other available chipsets in the market as they offer lower power consumption and faster speeds. The Apple iMac 2017 would be having the Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C ports for faster data transfer and battery charging. Apple could also be considering making the flash storage the next storage standard from the iMac 2017. The fusion drives could very well be the default storage for the new iMacs.

Its TrueVR  platform has been used for a range of live shows and events, including the NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four, New York Fashion Week, the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup, live streams of concerts, and select NBA, NFL and college football games.   Intel Capital recently led a $12.5 million “A” round in Voke, along with participation from the Sacramento Kings, A+E Networks and Nautilus Ventures.   “Together, we can innovate and scale our new immersive sports business faster to bring fans the most personalized, fully immersive VR experience ever imagined and change the way networks, sports leagues and teams engage with their audiences,” Carwana said.

Here are the top things you should know about the growing VR, AR, and MR markets. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 5, 2016 at 3:04PM There's been a lot of buzz in the tech world about virtual-, augmented-, and "mixed"-reality devices. All this talk about different digital "realities" is exciting, but it can also be confusing for investors who haven't been following these next-gen markets. Therefore, let's take a moment to review what those three markets actually consist of. Image source: Getty Images. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) devices immerse a user in a virtual world, which mostly blocks their view and perception of the outside world. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that this market will grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. The hardware market mainly consists of tethered, mobile, and standalone devices. Tethered VR headsets, such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR, must be connected to a high-powered PC or gaming console. These devices generally offer the highest-end VR experiences and track a user's head position with optical sensors and lasers installed in "base stations" around the room. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently revealed several new tethered VR headsets that can track a user's head position by using internal sensors instead of base stations -- making it easier for multiple users to share the same physical space. Mobile VR headsets, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard, use smartphones as the "brains" of their devices. These devices are cheaper and less powerful than their tethered counterparts, but users' movements aren't restricted by wires or their proximity to a PC or console. Google Cardboard (L) and Gear VR (R). Image source: Company websites. Standalone VR headsets aren't widely available yet, but they could strike a balance between the power of tethered headsets with the convenience of mobile ones. Oculus VR's upcoming Santa Cruz headset will free the Rift from PCs for a fully wireless experience. Augmented and mixed reality Augmented reality (AR) devices project digital overlays over real-world objects. Niantic's Pokemon Go, which projects Pokemon into real-life environments with the smartphone camera, is an early example of AR gaming. Digi-Capital believes that the AR market could be worth $90 billion by 2020, thanks to the growth of AR apps on mobile devices. In the near future, depth-sensing cameras will probably accurately place digital creatures onto real-world surfaces such as tables and floors -- paving the way for all new gameplay possibilities. Google Glass was also an early attempt to "augment" a user's reality with digital information, but it flopped because of privacy concerns. Looking ahead, the most closely watched AR device is Microsoft's HoloLens, which detects surfaces and projects holographic images on top of them. Microsoft has already showcased how the device can be used for tabletop Minecraft, the creation of 3D designs, or even projecting a hologram of another person into your room. The development version of the HoloLens still costs $3,000, but it should cost a lot less when it's finally released to the general public. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also trying to reduce the price of these next-gen AR devices down with Project Alloy, an open-source standalone headset that also projects virtual objects onto real-world ones. That device is powered by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing camera and a sixth-generation Core processor. Mixed reality (MR) is a newer term that's often used interchangeably with AR. Headsets such as the HoloLens and Project Alloy are often called MR devices because they "mix" VR features of head and motion tracking with AR features of digital overlays on real objects. Nonetheless, they can still simply be called AR devices because they "augment" users' reality without immersing them in a "virtual" world. Watch the ecosystems and the suppliers As these markets grow, battles between ecosystems will erupt. Facebook is already expanding its Oculus Home platform on the Rift and Gear VR, Google is introducing its rival Daydream platform, and Microsoft plans to turn Windows 10 into a holographic platform for its upcoming VR headsets and HoloLens. Suppliers will also engage in fierce battles to provide the components. InvenSense, STMicroelectronics, and Bosch are battling each other to supply the gyroscopes and accelerometers that track users' movements. AMD and NVIDIA are already making gaming GPU cards much cheaper with low-end "VR ready" cards. A $120 billion market opportunity If all goes well, the combined VR and AR market might be worth about $120 billion by 2020. However, mainstream adoption could be tough if VR and AR devices are merely considered pricey toys for hardcore gamers and tech enthusiasts. Therefore, prices will need to drop and killer apps (on par with Pokemon Go) must emerge to pique the public's interest. If that happens, the VR market could become a new pillar of growth for many of the companies mentioned here.

Read more Want to be an entrepreneur? The ultimate guide to getting started Want to be an entrepreneur? The ultimate guide to getting started By Liat Clark Open Bionics co-founder Samantha Payne with eleven-year-old Tilly Michael Newington Gray Payne co-founded Open Bionics in 2014. It won a $250,000 (£201,000) cash prize at the finals of Intel's 'Make it Wearable Challenge' for its work developing low-cost bionic hands that look and feel good. "We’re inspired by technology and trying to replicate anatomy. The human hand is super amazing – we don’t think about it because we use them all the time, but they’re so strong, you can move them so quickly and they tell you so much about the world.” ADVERTISEMENT Read more How to build a billion pound app How to build a billion pound app By Ruby Lott-Lavigna Michael Newington Gray Download the Ada hand code Payne’s four-person robotics team can build a fully customised bionic arm in just three days while a prosthetic arm from the NHS can take up to three months. But for Payne, three days is still too long, so she’s made her designs open-source and invited the world to print off their own limbs and push her technology to the next level. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Mobiles now have the same global impact as the annual footprint of Austria Mobiles now have the same global impact as the annual footprint of Austria By Matt Burgess While she was working at her Bristol-based lab, Payne received a message from someone she’d never met before – an American veteran who had lost his arm in Afghanistan. “By the way,” he said, “I was researching prosthetic limbs and I downloaded your file and made it myself.” There's a bionic girl at #WIREDNextGen! 🤖 pic.twitter.com/SL1ZgB1id5— Open Bionics (@openbionics) November 5, 2016 “When you’re open source you open your technology to millions of other people who want to improve it, you advance it much faster than if their were just four of us in a robotics lab,” she said. When anyone can download and print off their own bionic arms, it opens up a world of opportunity for personalised prosthetics, Payne said. “Who’s to say what your replacement hand should look like? It’s an expression of yourself.” Traditionally prosthetic hands have been made to imitate human hands, but Payne wants to give children the chance to choose their own limbs. “We want to change children who have limb differences into bionic superheroes.” ADVERTISEMENT One of those superheroes joined her on stage at WIRED Next Generation, 11-year-old Tilly. Tilly was just 15 months old when she had to have her hand amputated after contracting meningitis septicemia. The replacement she was originally fitted with, though, was a world away from hand she needed. “It was basically a puppet hand, it only had three fingers and it was made of metal. My mum thought it was more of a weapon than a hand,” she said. Now, with a bionic arm from Open Bionics, Tilly can move all of her fingers and perform more complex movements. EMG sensors on her arm detect muscle movement, telling her bionic arm how quickly or firmly to squeeze its fingers. Payne’s bionic arms are much more than just technical achievements. When a child picks their bionic arm, choosing to become Iron Man, Princess Elsa or Mace Windu, they’re taking control of their own identity. “These prosthetics enable children to do more of the activities their peers can do, but they also make them feel more empowered about what they can do themselves.” Share this article RECOMMENDED 3D print your own tabletop board games 3D print your own tabletop board games By Matt Kamen 3D Printing 17 Mar 2015 Gallery: 3D print your own tabletop board games Gallery: 3D print your own tabletop board games By Matt Kamen 3D Printing 17 Mar 2015 3D print your own Knight Rider car 3D print your own Knight Rider car By Matt Kamen Knight Rider 28 Jul 2015 London's contactless Tube payment system is going global London's contactless Tube payment system is going global By James Temperton Technology 13 Jul 2016 Privacy policy and cookie statement Terms & conditions Careers Contact © Condé Nast UK 2016

George Comment   ·   print   ·   T  T   T+  ·   T- Tweet PTI Ro Khanna is likely to be elected on Tuesday as an Indian American member of the U.S. House of Representatives and he has a valuable endorsement from former President Jimmy Carter. FILE PHOTO V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS  US PRESIDENTIAL POLLS World USA demographics diaspora election national elections India politics Ro Khanna (40) is taking his third shot at winning the 17th Congressional District, with bigwigs putting their money on him. California’s 17th Congressional District in the heart of Silicon Valley has a high concentration of Indian Americans, and it is likely to elect an Indian American member of U.S House of Representatives on Tuesday. Forty-year old Ro Khanna is taking his third shot at winning the district, and this time he has established a marginal lead over Mike Honda – incumbent since 2001– three days ahead of polling. Both of them are Democrats, facing off in the general election after scoring the highest in the top-two primary system in the State. Mr. Khanna had come first in the primary. Bigwigs bet on Ro Should he win, Mr. Khanna will represent a district where Tesla, Apple, Intel, Yahoo and eBay are headquartered. Among the Silicon Valley figures who have put their money on Mr. Khanna – in many cases literally too – are investor Marc Andreessen, Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg. Mr. Khanna had the backing of the tech community for his first two runs also, but what makes the difference this time is the support that he has obtained from the masses. “Mr. Honda has managed to retain the district all these years because the unions and working class supported him always. Silicon Valley is not only about technologists and entrepreneurs. Ro has the backing from major labour unions and working class people this time,” said M. R. Rangaswamy, a community leader and entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley. Mr. Honda has always attacked Mr. Khanna for his close association with the tech industry, and this time, specifically for a contribution that he received from PayPal founder Peter Thiel. Mr. Thiel has endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Jimmy Carter endorses him Mr. Khanna had run for the seat first when was 27 and single. He joined the Obama administration in the Department of Commerce. Unlike last time, President Barack Obama has not endorsed Mr. Honda. Mr. Khanna has a valuable endorsement from former President Jimmy Carter. Having learned his lessons from the first two races, Mr. Khanna has kept his reputation of being an advocate for disruptive digital economy in the background, while pivoting his campaign around issues such as job creation, efficient public school system and other issues that touch that the lives of middle class people more closely. Mr. Khanna was born in Philadelphia to immigrants parents from Punjab, and his maternal grandfather Amarnath Vidyalankar was a freedom fighter and a member of Lok Sabha.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 5, 2016 -- 11:57 GMT (04:57 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Costco lists plenty of PC sales in its leaked Black Friday ad, but it doesn't list the final sale price. The last of the warehouse club trinity has seen its Black Friday ad leak, as Costco joins Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale in having its plans divulged for the shopping holiday. The good news for potential PC buyers? Costco has more laptop and desktop deals listed than its competitors. The bad news? You'll need to do some sleuthing to determine what price it's actually offering on them. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals While most Black Friday ads list the final price you pay, Costco apparently wants you to be happy just knowing the amount you're saving. In addition to forcing you to do extra work (such as actually going to a Costco location or its website), the tactic can conceal a favorite Black Friday pricing strategy: raising the "original" price to inflate the discount offered. As with its rivals, Costco has limited its slate tablet specials to Samsung's Galaxy Tab A models. Its $100 discount on the 10.1-inch version is $20 more than what Sam's Club is offering (and also includes a 32GB microSD card), while it's also taking $80 off the price of the 8-inch flavor (currently $199.99 on Samsung's own site). Like BJ's, Costco also has a sale on Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 tablet with Intel's Core i5 processor, providing $250 of savings (presumably the configuration with 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD, though the ad doesn't specify). Also like BJ's the Surface Book 2-in-1 is discounted, with an unspecified Core i5 configuration receiving a $250 price trim. There are a baker's dozen more laptops listed in Costco's Black Friday, with the following savings advertised: Acer Chromebook 14 (14-inch full HD, Intel Celeron) -- $65 off Acer Spin 3 2-in-1 (15.6-inch touchscreen, Core i7) -- $100 off Acer Spin 5 2-in-1 (13.3-inch full HD touchscreen, Core i5) -- $100 off Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 (15.6-inch full HD touchscreen, Core i7) -- $200 off Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (15.6-inch full Hd display, Core i7) -- $150 off Dell XPS 13 (13.3-inch QHD+ touchscreen, Core i7) -- $300 off HP Envy x360 13-y013cl 2-in-1 (13.3-inch touchscreen, Core i7) -- $200 off HP Envy x360 13t 2-in-1 (13.3-inch touchscreen, Core i7) -- $300 off HP Envy 15t (15.6-inch full HD touchscreen, Core i7) -- $200 off HP Envy 17t (17.3-inch full HD display, Core i7) -- $400 off HP Pavilion 15t (15.6-inch full HD touchscreen, Core i7) -- $400 off HP Pavilion 15t (15.6-inch full HD touchscreen, Core i7, Windows 10 Professional) -- $550 off Lenovo Flex 4 2-in-1 (15.6-inch touchscreen, Core i7) -- $250 off Costco lists a trio of desktop PC deals in its ad, including an HP Pavilion all-in-one with 23.8-inch touchscreen and Core i5 CPU for $150 off. There's also an HP Envy 750-467c tower with a Core i7 processor for $250 off, while a Dell XPS 8900 tower also equipped with a Core i7 chip and an unspecified Nvidia graphics card gets a $200 discount.

Popular tipster, Evan Blass posted some images of an unknown windows phone. By: Chakri Kudikala Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 16:49 [IST] Microsoft selling off Nokia six months ago raised many eyebrows as the Redmond giant is working on their own Windows 10 powered smartphone, which might be dubbed as the Surface Phone. Microsoft has been struggling a lot in the smartphone arena for a while now and the vendor recently even claimed that they will be killing the Lumia lineup by the end of this year. SEE ALSO: 3 Coolest Features of Google Pixel, Pixel XL That'll Blow Your Mind for Sure Off late, the Windows Phone platform has been struggling a lot with the rivals Android and iOS. However, the tech giant isn't yet done with the smartphone arena. There were several rumors over the internet suggesting the purported specifications of the upcoming smartphone, but none of them showed us how the smartphone looks. Late yesterday, popular tipster, Evan Blass tweeted some images of an unknown windows phone with a tagline 'Powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, would this have blown your mind?', which essentially means that the phone will be powered by a high-end Intel processor. SEE ALSO: Find out How to Create Chat Bots with little or no Clue about Coding A couple of hours later, a follower of Blass replied to his tweet saying it as a concept phone. However, Blass quickly replied to the user's comment as 'Much more than just a concept'. This proves that the smartphone is not just a concept, but there isn't much info about the smartphone. As stated earlier, Microsoft is working on a new Windows 10 smartphone and it looks like this smartphone is the Surface phone. Some earlier rumors suggested that Microsoft will release the Surface phone is early 2017.

Nov 3, 2016 Christine Hall EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement Central to the development of open source software is the community. This is partly because many open source projects depend on contributions from unpaid volunteers, which makes community ties important. But even large enterprise projects must pay attention to community needs. Large scale projects like Hadoop, OpenStack, Hyperledger, and even Linux, all transcend corporate boundaries, which necessitates communities that span individual corporate cultures. It's not surprising, then, that successful open source enterprises take on experts to help them develop, manage and nurture their communities. Jono Bacon is one of the most visible open source community managers. For nearly eight years he was the community manager for Ubuntu. After that he spent time as the senior director of community at XPRIZE and as GitHub's community director. These days he heads his own consulting firm, with clients that have included IBM, Deutsche Bank, Intel and SAP. Last week he picked up the reigns as the master of ceremonies at the All Things Open conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he took a few minutes on the event's opening morning to talk about community. He began by pointing out the obvious -- that the value of communities goes beyond the mere creation of software. "I believe the community is at the center of how we innovate and how we just build a better planet," he said, before drawing attention to a graph indicating that the growth of communities is on the rise. "What this taps into is that people want to work together and we want to do work that's meaningful and impactful. One of the finest places to do this, of course, is technology." He noted the monetary value of several open technology projects. The Smithsonian places Wikipedia's value at tens of billions of dollars, for example, and the Linux Foundation said in 2008 that to rebuild Fedora, Red Hat's community Linux distro, would cost somewhere around $11 billion using commercial software methodology. "What this does is it changes the conversation," he said. "I've been going to conferences for years and we always talk about code ..., but what's as important, if not more important, is how we build communities and get people involved, because communities don't just provide code, they provide advocacy, documentation, translations, accessibility.... They bring new ideas, fresh approaches and diversity." Bacon pointed out that there are many avenues open for building communities, but the problem is with building communities that are predictable. "That's difficult because human beings are messy, frankly. We're difficult people to figure out," he said. "The way I tend to think of this is that there are three primary layers to this," he explained. "The first is collaboration. This is the software development life cycle piece. This is code, code hosting, collaboration, peer review, containerization, all those different pieces. This is the meat and potatoes of how we do this. But what sits on top of that is engagement. This is how you pull people in, how you get them excited and participating. How do you retain them? How do you govern them? How do you incentivize them in different ways? "What's fascinating to me, and what's been a real revelation to me in the last three or four years, is that underlying all of this is the psychology of how people think and operate in behavior economics -- that we are fundamentally irrational human beings, but we're irrational in very predictable ways. When we understand that, it provides a framework, a scaffolding, a skeleton on which we can build effective collaboration, and on top of that we can build effective engagement." He went on to suggest that he thinks it best to start with the bottom layer and work up "because you can only build effective collaboration if you understand how people think and operate." Unfortunately, his experience is that most companies tend to want to focus on the top "engagement" level. "But the deeper you go down," he said, "you get more value. If you assess and measure collaboration you understand your developers better, but if you understand the psychology of how people operate, you really get to the heart of how human beings like to collaborate and build communities."

Minyanville The 5 Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks By Scutify Nov 04, 2016 8:11 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. As 2016 starts to close and we start investing with a head toward 2017, one of the most obvious plays in the market is ... well, one of the most obvious plays of at least the past couple of decades: tech stocks. Source: magicatwork via Flickr But as we've seen thanks to big momentum moves by the likes ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and more, dabbling in single-name tech stocks can be perilous. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it - that's what the aggressive allocation of your portfolio is for. But it does mean that if you're looking to get broad exposure to tech stocks, you would do well to also invest in one or two of the best exchange-traded funds that focus on the space. ETFs are a great solution for trying to invest in anything from whole sectors to industries to trends like the internet of things or artificial intelligence. That's because they grant you exposure to a number of players, meaning you don't have to necessarily guess the one or two best stocks in the space. And the best ETFs allow you to do this for next to nothing in annual expenses. The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet As we turn the clock forward to 2017, here's a look at five of the best ETFs that invest in tech stocks. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) Expenses: 0.14% If you're looking to invest in any sector, the first place to look should be State Street Global Advisors' Select Sector SPDR funds. That's not to say they're always the best, but more often than not, they provide strong performance for cheap, and they're about as liquid as you can ask for. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) is the largest tech ETF on the planet at just about $13 billion in assets. And its holdings list is a who's who of big tech, including Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). XLK's performance has outdone most of its broad-based tech peers over the long run, and the ETF is among the cheapest you can buy at just 14 basis points. But no investor should jump in unless they're OK with the fund's ... well, its weight problem. Apple makes up roughly 14% of the fund, and Microsoft makes up another 10%. All told, the top five companies represented in XLK - the four above, plus AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) - make up almost half the weight. That means as they go - for the most part - XLK goes. That has its advantages in that all of these companies are extremely well-heeled, cash-rich firms that can weather a market blow or two, whether it's AAPL shelling out more dividends or buybacks, or FB buying out a couple new companies for growth. It has its disadvantages in that the concentration in mega-caps, as well as exposure really only to blue chips, isn't necessarily the most conducive to rapid price appreciation. You can read more about the XLK ETF here. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) Expenses: 0.35% (includes 6-basis-point fee waiver) Sometimes, the best money to be made in technology isn't in the consumer-facing side, but the comparatively boring internals. For instance, semiconductors. When you think of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), you almost assuredly think of PCs - the declining industry that's hampering Intel. What you should be thinking, though, is that Intel's solutions also power everything from digital storage to point-of-sales systems to, more recently, driverless automotion via a partnership with BMW and Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY). Or let's get really meta and consider Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM), a foundry that serves other semiconductor firms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO). And from time to time, even Intel actually outsources its chipset manufacturing to TSM. These are the companies that will power just about every emerging technology on the planet, and that's advantageous to investors because it reduces the risk of investing directly in the more risky front-facing technologies that could flop hard if their gambles are wrong. In short, if a company like AMD powers a number of virtual reality technologies, then it's a much safer bet than trying to pick which VR company will get it right. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) is a concentrated fund of just 26 holdings, and it's overweight TSM and INTC at about 15% each. But it covers most of the biggest players across the globe, making it a faithful play in the semiconductor space. You can read more about the SMH ETF here. ADVERTISEMENT Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT) Expenses: 0.47% If investing in slower-growth blue-chips isn't your thing, the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA:XT) very well might be. While iShares touts a few reasons to buy, the most important is this: "The fund's index uses a unique evaluation process to identify companies developing and/or leveraging promising technologies." In other words, XT is trying to get out in front of the crowd. Thus, you're going to see a number of emerging technologies represented, such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, not to mention a few other tech avenues that might have been around for a while already, but are really starting to come into their own. Take a look at the top holdings. AMD products are used in everything from drones to medical imaging.Exelixis, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXEL) is actually a biotechnology company whose developing treatments are focused on ailments from thyroid cancer to tumors. MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ:MELI) is a Latin-American e-commerce platform. Yes, you can practically guarantee that several of XT's holdings are destined for the scrapyard, as not every emerging technology actually emerges, and some that do don't do so right away. Heck, the tech world has given virtual reality the ol' college try several times over the past decade. But that's OK. XT also differs from XLK in that it's equally weighted, rather than market-cap weighted, so currently none of the ETF's 189 holdings accounts for more than 1.57% of the fund. Thus, total failures are mitigated. You can read more about the XT ETF here. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: PureFunds ETFx HealthTech ETF (IMED) Expenses: 0.75% Everywhere you look, you'll find some gaudy predictions about the future of healthcare technology. For instance ... Grand View Research sees global healthcare firms investing $410 billion in software, services and internet of things-connected devices in 2022. Evaluate Ltd. is projecting a $477.5 billion market in medtech by 2020. Research and Markets expects the global healthcare analytics market to explode from $8.48 billion in 2015 to $23.8 billion by 2020. Long story short: Technology is increasingly encroaching into the healthcare space, and there's a lot of money to be made there. The PureFunds ETFx HealthTech ETF (NASDAQ:IMED) is one of a scant few ways to invest broadly in this trend. IMED focuses on three specific areas: healthcare informatics, medical instruments and medical devices. That results in holdings like Quality Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:QSII), which deals in things such as electronic health records and interoperability solutions for both medical and dental practices, or medical device company ICU Medical, Incorporated (NASDAQ:ICUI), which boasts products such as MicroClave for infusion therapy and hemodynamic monitoring systems. The 10 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for 2016 IMED is a small fund, at just more than $2 million in assets, and the 0.75% expense ratio is far from cheap, but this is one of the best ETF plays on the blossoming healthcare tech market. You can read more about the IMED ETF here. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (FINX) Expenses: 0.68% Using cash less and less? You're not alone. Many people have almost completely phased out their use of cash, and that's thanks to - and benefiting - the fintech space. The fintech space is awfully broad and combines new and old technologies alike. If you've swiped a credit card at a retail store or a restaurant in your life ... well, a fintech company is powering that. But naturally, the space is filled with slightly newer financial technologies as well. There's PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), which not only is an increasingly popular online payment option, but has expanded to acceptance in brick-and-mortar stores, too. And there's LendingTree Inc(NASDAQ:TREE), the online exchange that hooks up both individuals and businesses with potential lenders. The Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) invests in 29 such companies, featuring consumer-facing names such as PayPal and Square Inc (NYSE:SQ), as well as companies like SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC), which powers complex functions such as trading and accounting for financial firms. Like IMED, FINX is hardly cheap, but it's a targeted play on a couple of burgeoning tech industries.

Believe it or not, some of the best gaming PCs are under $1000. However, they face stiff competition from Microsoft and Sony, both who produce excellent gaming consoles for less than $500. Thankfully, many of the top premade PC manufacturers have realized that in order to keep up with their living room competition, they must bring the cost of entry down to remain competitive. So, here are our picks for the 5 top gaming PCs under $1,000. Top Gaming PC Under $1,000 2016   CyberPowerPC Gamer Dragon Syber Vapor One Alienware X51 R3 Digital Velocity Micro Vanquish 4 Lenovo Erazer X315 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice #2 #3 #4 #5 Amazon Rating na na Processor Type/Speed Intel Core i7 4790K 4.0GHz Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7-6700 4.0GHz Intel Core i5-6500 3.2Ghz (6th-gen Skylake) A10-Series APU A10-7850K 3.7GHz Graphics Card AMD R9 380 4GB AMD R9 380 4GB AMD R9 370 4GB Nvidia GTX 960 AMD Radeon R9 260 2GB Available RAM/Speed 8GB/1600MHz 8GB/2133MHz 8GB/2133MHz 8GB/2133MHz 16GB/1600MHz Storage (SSD/HDD) 1TB HDD 1TB HDD 256GB/1TB 120GB/1TB 2TB Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard 7.1 Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard 7.1 Audio Warranty 3 Years Labor /3 Year Parts 1 Year Parts /3 Year Labor 1 Year Parts/Labor 1 Year Parts/ 3 Year Labor 3 Year Parts/Labor Price $919 $964 $999 $999 $949 View on Cyberpower View on Amazon View on Amazon View on Digital Storm View on Amazon #1 Pick CyberPower PC’s Gamer Dragon This much power never came so cheap WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dragon is the best pick for 4K gamer’s budget.  Among the PC gaming community, the customizers and builders at CyberPowerPC are legend. The company is one of the longest running in the business, offering insane deals and discounts on some of the best gaming hardware that assures you you’re always going to get the best possible bang for your buck. Thanks to wholesale buying practices and a dedicated workforce, often the price you’ll pay to build your own comparative system is only around $50 less than what you’d get for CyberPower to build, customize, and ship the whole package to you in one plug-and-play piece. The company offers dozens of different models that feature a range of specific options you can use to refine what you need out of your machine, but in the pre-built category at least, few offer as strong a value as you’ll find in the latest Gamer Dragon. With an AMD R9 380 4GB graphics card and an 8-core AMD FX8320 processor, the Dragon streams through AAA titles at 4K resolution without slipping a frame. Of course, if those specs aren’t up to your bar, the best thing about shopping at CyberPowerPC is nearly every single component on the PC you buy is customizable, giving you the option to add or remove any parts to get the power-to-cost ratio exactly where you want it on the dial. View on Cyberpower – $919 #2 Pick Syber Vapor One The Syber Vapor One is solid gaming PC for under $1000. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Syber One is a PC made for the console convert.  When Steam OS was first announced by Valve back in 2013, dozens of desktop manufacturers rushed out products that were primed to take advantage of the new and exciting operating system. In the case of Syber’s Vapor I, it’s a bit of a “counting your chickens before they hatch” scenario, where potential Steam Machines were commissioned and built before Valve had even confirmed their OS was in beta, leaving them to ship the computer running a regular build of Windows instead. Nonetheless, the company pushed on, pairing their lineup of console competitors with Windows 10 and Steam’s “Big Picture Mode” installed from the start. The gamble paid off, and the Vapor I is a well-priced PC that makes itself just as much at home under your desk as it does sharing a little space next to the PS4 or Xbox One in your living room. It’s got all the power you need to compare to what a console puts out, and a form factor that simply can’t be beat by anything else in its class. View on Amazon – $999 #3 Pick Alienware X51 R3 Style and power make the Alienware X15 a top contender. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK:  The Alienware is built to perform in any condition.  As one of the oldest prebuilt desktop computer manufacturers around, Alienware has worked long and hard to shake off the rep that it only makes “overpriced, underpowered machines for people who don’t know any better”. Simply uttering the name in an PC enthusiast forum is enough to get you shadowbanned for life, but over the past several years the company has made immense strides in creating products that look just as good as they perform – all for a price that won’t send your wallet limping off to the hospital. Read: Best Gaming Laptops 2016 The X51 R3 is the latest PC gaming desktop that is endlessly customizable from the minute you sign on to the website, giving you the option to add as much horsepower as you think you might need and shave off any of the extra noise that doesn’t result in smooth, polygon-packed gaming at its finest. With an Intel 6th-generation Core i7 Skylake processor, it’s rocking the most up-to-date processor of all the other options listed here, not to mention the addition of 8GB of DDR4 RAM clocked to a whopping 2133MHz. If you want the cutting edge of what’s out there right now, look no further than Alienware’s latest and greatest desktop gaming lineup. View on Amazon – $999 #4 Pick Digital Storm Vanquish 4 A powerful gaming PC with upgrade capabilities. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Digital Storm Vanquish is an all-around star.  Digital Storm has always been known for their attention to detail and quality, and the latest addition to the Vanquish 4 lineup is no different. While it may not be the sleekest or the most stylish of the bunch, it still offers a solid combination of hardware features that will churn out 1080p graphics on medium-to-max settings, depending on the game of your choice. Read: Best Gaming PC 2016 The Vanquish manages to pack in a 5th-generation Intel i5 6500 CPU alongside an Nvidia GTX950 2GB graphics card, both considered to be some of the best valued peripherals that crank out power like nothing else in the business. Best of all, the Vapor I starts at just $899, leaving a solid Benjamin of room for any extra customization options you might want to add on before you hit the checkout. View on Amazon – $725+ #5 Pick Lenovo Erazer X315 An unexpected monster under the hood WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Lenovo offers serious power for multitaskers everywhere.  Although Lenovo may not exactly be well-known for their gaming pedigree, in recent years the company has shifted its focus onto making solid, reliable, and powerful gaming PCs that don’t cost an arm and a leg but still post impressive specs and an even more impressive all-around build quality. The Erazer X315 is the best of this latest collection of high-powered desktops to enter the fray, featuring a whopping 12GB of DDR3 RAM, an R9 260 2GB graphics card, and an AMD A10-7850K processor. Sure, it may not be the prettiest girl at the ball or feature all the sex appeal you might get with the Vapor I, but what it lacks in raw aesthetics it more than makes up for in pure, unadulterated power. The Erazer X315 is a beast beneath the hood, and runs at just under our limit for a cool $999 USD. View on Amazon – $949 Common Mistakes to Avoid When shopping on a budget, especially in the realm of PC gaming, you’re always going to want to choose substance over flash. Sure, a lot of prebuilt boxes out there pride themselves on spectacular design and more LEDs lining the case than you can shake a stick at, but it’s important to remember that all these extra design elements don’t come cheap. As such, you’ll want to avoid things like custom case modifications, laser engraving, or “special anodized materials”, because at the end of the day all these frills do is cut into money that could be better spent on beefing up the graphics card, RAM, or processor. Gaming PCs need all the power they can get, and while the urge to show them off to your friends at the local LAN party may be strong, Features to Look For Processor/Graphics Card Although more often than not we’d split these two categories up, when it comes to prebuilt gaming PCs it’s rare that you’ll find two different brands of either installed in the same machine. This is to say that if you get a machine with an AMD processor, almost always that’s going to be paired with an AMD video card, and the same goes for Intel/Nvidia. One bottlenecks the other in gaming, and it isn’t recommended that you try and mix them up as both will have more options to work with their companion component if you keep them paired up. Nvidia cards work like a charm with Intel CPUs, and AMD processors work like a charm with cards under the same name. RAM Obviously, no gamer worth their salt is going to pack in anything less than 8GB of RAM into their machine, and in the sub-$1,000 range you usually aren’t going to find faster than two sticks clocked at 2400MHz. 1833MHz is fine as well, but the majority of demanding AAA titles these days will struggle if you try and kick this all the way down to 1600MHz. Hard Drive Space This is a big one. Many times the biggest mistake that budget gamers make when picking up a new PC is skimping on hard drive space, or simply grabbing an SSD and forgetting about a secondary HDD altogether. If you plan on gaming, you have to plan on setting aside at least 500GB (1TB ideally) of extra space to fit many of the popular games that are being released today. For example, the base version of The Witcher III  takes up a whopping 40GB of space on its own, let alone the extra add-ons with DLC and expansion packs. Internal/External WiFi Adapter If you plan on keeping your PC right next to your home’s networking modem, this isn’t a consideration, however if it’s going anywhere else, you need to make sure to either use a USB or internal WiFi card to pick up a wireless signal. With USB 3.0, most adapters can handle any speed you throw at them, although some people do still prefer the internal card in order to reduce the cable noise around their gaming station. So Which Gaming PC Under $1,000 is Right For You In a sentence: any of them! The great thing about PC gaming (outside of the beautiful graphics, endless customization, mods, reliable multiplayer, the list goes on), is unlike consoles, you’re never shoehorned into picking either one or the other. If you want something that looks sleek and plays clean, the Vanquish 4 has got the job covered. Want as much power as you can squeeze out of your budget? The AMD 8-core from CyberPower is an unparalleled beast of a machine. PC gaming gives you the option to play how you want to play, and never compromise for anything less than the best.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — NBC News disclosed the penetration in a series of reports, explaining that US efforts parallel claims, also by US officials, that Russia, China and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of US critical infrastructure. The penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an all-out war in cyberspace, according to NBC News, which said it was briefed by a US intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents. At the same time, the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war, making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to US adversaries. © AP Photo/ Mary Altaffer US Intel Doubts Alleged Russian Cyberattacks Could Affect Election Outcome – ReportsNBC News then attempted to link its explosive report to Tuesday’s US presidential election, citing concerns of mischief by Russian hackers that would fall far short of the Armageddon-like scenario that the report implied. Instead, the network explained US election-related concerns as "cyber mischief," which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation. The Obama administration has created a public, but unconfirmed narrative, that hackers controlled by the Russian government have stolen emails from the Democratic Party headquarters, a private computer used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of State and computers used by Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. According to the narrative, Russia stole the emails and gave the messages to WikiLeaks, which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to Tuesday’s election. Russia has denied any responsibility for the Clinton-related hacks and links between WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence have never been substantiated. Moreover, recent media reports in the United States indicate that Clinton’s private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services. The emails have proved especially embarrassing for the Clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the Clinton State Department that favored large donors to the Clinton Foundation in what appear to be "pay-for-play" schemes of selling access and influence. © Sputnik/ Vladimir Astapkovich Russia Has Tools to Respond to 'Unfriendly' US Steps in CyberspaceMoreover, the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former President Bill Clinton. Earlier this week, Fox News cited two unnamed sources claiming that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is close to recommending that Hillary Clinton be indicted for corruption while she served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The FBI has never publicly confirmed an investigation of Clinton Foundation fundraising links to the State Department. Instead, the FBI has limited its comments to a separate probe of whether Clinton mishandled classified information by using a private server. FBI Director James Comey closed the latter investigation without an indictment of Clinton, only to reopen it last Friday, claiming agents had discovered new emails on a computer used by the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Former federal prosecutor and New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani has said publicly that FBI agents are in open rebellion against the US Department of Justice for attempting to quash both Clinton criminal investigations. ...

In this Soviets were very right. Just don't show off. Soviets thought the weapon was less lethal. It knocked out all modern system and way more. They were laughing. Saying , (very NAIVE), and this are systems of the early 60's obsolete. And can knock modern insulated systems from very far away. Get it now? All may get BLIND. And careful, Russia found Stuxnet?

Follow @JournalistNikki By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Local drone industry insiders say they are working to make Nevada the industry’s “global destination of choice” and consistently tout Nevada as an industry leader. But is it? The Review-Journal caught up with several out-of-state industry experts at the Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Expo held Monday through Wednesday at the MGM Grand to find out. In short, the answer is mostly yes, Nevada is an industry leader nationally, but the jury is still out on its place in the global industry. Baptiste Tripard, director of business development and strategy for strategy for Intel’s New Technology Group, which works on commercial drones, said Nevada is “a little bit ahead” because of its Federal Aviation Administration designation as an unmanned aerial systems test site. Nevada is the only state authorized as a test site; the other six test sites are state agencies, airports or universities. “Nevada, in the drone community, is recognized as one of the leading states for drones,” he said, because of its FAA designation and the relationship the state has formed with the FAA which is “leading drone growth.” For others, like Colorado-based Eric McCuaig, market manager at Trimble, Nevada definitely has some buzz, but it’s too soon to label any state as “the” industry leader. “I’ve heard about a lot of the initiatives that Nevada has taken, so I think they do have a leadership role,” said McCuaig. “A lot of states are getting into the UAS (unmanned aircraft system) space, Nevada has got a history, along with California, New Mexico and other places in terms of aviation, so I think that they’ll be right there with a lot of other states in a leadership position.” Bruce Carpenter, vice president of business development at Utah-based Fortem Technologies, similarly said Nevada is one of many states competing for such a title, and described Utah as the “mountain Silicon Valley.”   “There is nothing I can think of that delineates them (Nevada) as being an expert in a certain area outside of the other geographical locations. There’s a lot of universities involved in UAV development right now and there are a lot of large companies that are focused on it,” he said. “The great thing is there’s a diverse capability throughout the US and Nevada is contributing to that.” Everybody said the industry is infused with a healthy dose of competition, domestically and abroad. “The rules, in all areas (around the world), have all been moving along at a similar pace,” McCuaig said. Back in 2011, when Trimble was developing their UAS in Belgium, for example, the European rules they were operating under were a bit more streamlined than the US. McCuaig said that some things “would have been a lot more difficult to do” in the US at that time. But, today US regulations for drones have surpassed Europe’s, he said. Carpenter and McCuaig listed Israel, Poland and Australia as countries competing with US for the “global destination of choice” title. “There’s nothing wrong with Nevada being inspired to reach that level,” Carpenter said. “There’s some very healthy competition out there for them to deal with, but it’s definitely great goal for Nevada to want to maintain and hold onto.” Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Jaewon Kang Nov 4, 2016 3:22 PM EDT GoPro (GPRO)  is plummeting after yet another disappointing quarter, but investors of action camera chip supplier Ambarella (AMBA)  can keep their heads up. GoPro shares are down about 4% mid-day Friday to $11.45 after reporting a weak Q3 Thursday after the markets close. The actions camera maker missed revenue and earnings per share estimates, posting $240.6 million in revenue and loss of 60 cents per share. Analysts were anticipating $313.4 million in revenue and loss of 35 cents per share. GoPro, which also missed full-year revenue guidance and fourth-quarter projected revenue, has seen its shares continue to plummet after a series of weak execution with new gadgets. In fact, shares are down about 87% since its record-high of $86.97 in 2014.  While GoPro struggles to turn the corner along with other peers in the gadget sector such as FitBit (FIT) -- FitBit plummeted over 30% after disappointing earnings this week -- GoPro chip supplier Ambarella continues to move onward and upward.  Chipmaker Ambarella, which relied on GoPro for about 50% of revenue when it went public in 2012, has slowly but steadily diversified away from the camera maker and gained exposure to more stable markets. And the semi is well-positioned for further upside thanks to its unique video processing technology. Compared to 2015 when GoPro made up approximately 30% of Ambarella's revenue, GoPro is estimated to contribute to just 10%, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy by phone, adding that the percentage will likely stay the same in 2017.  Ambarella is increasingly spending its capital toward other end-markets such as autonomous vehicles, Cassidy said.  "Home security is the fastest growing market," he said, adding that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based semi's long-term growth strategy has pivoted around diversification.  The semi has four main target markets: security, automotive, sports and broadcast content processing.   "The design of the chips is to handle video," Cassidy said, further explaining that other semis such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC) have tried to gain exposure to video processing.  "This is a core technology that would make Ambarella attractive to acquire because they have a core technology that nobody else has," he added. Cassidy further said Qualcomm, Intel or even Nvidia (NVDA) could eventually take a look at Ambarella. Still, Nvidia hasn't historically been an active acquirer while Qualcomm just agreed to pay about $38 billion for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) . Intel is currently digesting its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera last year.  Ambarella has also been growing over 20% annually and is run by a strong management team with impressive achievements.  Ambarella co-founder and CEO Feng-Ming Wang wrote the patent for MPEG and JPEG when he was working on his PhD degree. Company's CTO Les Kohn is the mind behind scalable processor architecture (SPARC) chips that are still used by Intel. His company Afara Websystems was bought in 2002 by Sun Microsystems, which was subsequently acquired by Oracle (ORCL) in 2009.  "These people are world class designers at the core," Cassidy said.

Toggle navigation Blog Kubernetes Jobs Community Impressum Nov 4, 2016 New sandbox features in systemd Restricting the privileges of Linux services and reducing the actor vector has always been challenging. You need to adapt your software  or start looking for  a sandbox program or a manager that handles this for you. And at this moment you should look at systemd. systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons and keeps track of processes using Linux control groups. systemd also supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit. [1] Securing services is not only useful for the cloud but also for the embedded and IoT industries. In a  world where all components are tied together, things move fast and you have to accelerate your development/shipping cycle, you need a manager for your services or applications that will keep you secure. It should 1) solve the most basic problems of system and service management in an efficient way. 2) handle security and sandbox operations. If your service is affected by a vulnerability, then you want to reduce the exposure. 3) handle resources consumption. 4) be reliable, stable and able to restart your services on failures. And this is where systemd enters the arena. systemd is supported by the major actors in the industry, for example Red Hat, Intel or SUSE. These players offer the resources to make it a reliable technology, while it covers all these issues we just listed. Current states In this quick summary we will show you some of the security features that help you secure your services and applications: 1) Set root directory for your service RootDirectory= | Sets the root directory for executed processes of the unit. It uses the plain old chroot() functionality. 2) Protect your file system and disk PrivateDevices=yes | Prevents your services from accessing the raw disks. 3) Disable network PrivateNetwork=yes | Securely turn off network access for executed processes of the unit. 4) Protect your file system ProtectSystem= | Makes /usr, /boot and even the full file system read only. Preventing any modification of the file system. This is particularly useful for Embedded Systems to support factory reset. 5) Private temporary directory  PrivateTmp=yes | Gives a private temporary file system for the processes of the unit that is not shared by other processes. 6) Set user, group and supplementary groups for your service User=, Group= , SupplementaryGroups= | Sets the user, group, and supplementary Unix groups under which the processes of the unit are executed. 7) Watchdog and restart your services on failure RuntimeWatchdogSec= of /etc/systemd/system.conf, ShutdownWatchdogSec=, WatchdogSec=, Restart=on-failure | Supports hardware and software watchdog features to allow the hardware to reset itself, or to enable automatic service restarts on failure using the software watchdog feature. 8) Control CPU usage LimitCPU=, CPUAccounting=, CPUQuota= | Turn on CPU accounting and sets the CPU limits for the processes of the unit. 9) Control Memory usage MemoryMax=, MemoryLow=, MemoryHigh= and TasksMax=N | Sets the memory limits for processes of the unit and the maximum number of tasks that can be created. 10) Control Linux Capabilities CapabilityBoundingSet= and AmbientCapabilities= | Sets which Linux capabilities the processes of the unit will have. 11) Block access to Linux interfaces SystemCallFilter= | Blocks access to Linux system calls. This is particular useful if there is a vulnerability in Linux and you want to block access to it. As an example you could block the recent Linux kernel madvise vulnerability [2] by using “SystemCallFilter=~madvise” . This blocks access to Linux madvice system call, thus effectively blocking all exploits. New security features: These are cool features, but there is more. Endocode engineers helped with and contributed to some new features that will improve the security of your system even more.   Here are some of the new features we just worked on: 1) Block loading and unloading arbitrary Linux kernel modules. ProtectKernelModules=yes | Blocks explicit loading and unloading of kernel modules, drivers, etc. Particularly useful for Embedded Systems to make sure that your kernel is not modified. 2) Protect your file system ProtectSystem=strict | Makes the whole file system read only for the processes of the unit. 3) Prevent Linux kernel tuning ProtectKernelTunables=yes | Prevents tuning and configuring some Linux kernel parameters during run-time. 4) Prevent manipulation of Control Groups ProtectControlGroups=yes | Prevents tuning resources parameters of processes. 5) Dynamic User and group DynamicUser=yes | Dynamically creates a user and group for your services. The user and group are re-cycled when the service terminates and all its files removed. Particularly useful for Embedded Systems to run services or apps with an empty /etc without even /etc/passwd and /etc/group databases. Check out systemd version 232 release notes for more information. Conclusion In this short blog post we showed how systemd can be used on Embedded Systems to manage your services, solve the most basic problems and sandbox your services. Naturally as software continues to advance, more problems are found and we are keen to continue solving them.

The UNYQ Align is described as a "personalised, fashionable and breathable" back brace by its makers UNYQ. The Seattle- and Seville-based company, which specialises in orthopaedic and prosthetic products, worked with 3D-printing pioneer Francis Bitonti and technology company Intel on the product. Braces are a common treatment for scoliosis, which affects an estimated 6 to 9 million people in the United States. "The condition typically develops in 10-15 year olds, occurring equally among both genders," said UNYQ in a statement. "Young girls, however, are eight times more likely to progress to a curve magnitude that requires treatment." As members of this demographic can be particularly self conscious about their appearance, the goal was to create a more discrete brace that wearers would feel comfortable in. Related story Cortex 3D-printed cast by Jake Evill Typically, the apparatus has to be worn for up to 18 hours a day to be most effective. "Traditional braces, which have not been advanced for half a decade, make it difficult for patients to reach the minimum recommended bracing period per day because they are constricting, bulky and perceived as unattractive," said UNYQ. Using digital design and algorithms, Bitonti's studio was able to create a lattice that has 75 per cent less material than its predecessor – the Boston Brace – but still provides the necessary support. The new form gives better manoeuvrability and looks less obtrusive, the team claims. "The first patient to try it on was very happy that she could actually bend from her waist when wearing it," Bitonti told Dezeen, "something she had never been able to do before." The brace is also embedded with tiny data-capturing computer modules developed by Intel, which allow the user to monitor their progress via an app. It debuted during an event at the White House earlier this year, and was presented as part of the FashioNXT event in Portland last month. "It's not everyday you see a medical device launch at a fashion show," said Bitonti. "UNYQ AlignTM demonstrates how innovative technologies, designers, and technologists can combine to revolutionise treatment of medical conditions and dramatically improve the lives of the people who rely on assistive devices." UNYQ Align will be available from a select number of hospitals in the US from early 2017 through a charter programme. "It's a momentous step forward and the launching point for further innovation to continuously advance scoliosis treatment," said UNYQ CEO Eythor Bender. 3D-printing is being used for a variety of medical purposes. Similar to the brace, the technology has been proposed for lattice-like casts for fractured bones. More complex applications involve printing replacements for missing sections of bone or whole body parts, and even internal organs – though the latter is still under development.

STMicro, Sony, and Intel could all benefit from buying the motion sensor maker. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 1:00PM Chipmaker InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) is reportedly interested in selling itself, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources. InvenSense supplies motion sensors to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, and other mobile-device makers, but it's had a rough year because of rising competition and sluggish smartphone sales. Image source: InvenSense. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to fall 24% this year, compared with 47% growth in 2015. Those bleak expectations sent the stock tumbling almost 40% over the past 12 months. With an enterprise value of just over $600 million, InvenSense now has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.6, making it a fairly cheap purchase for companies interested in its "best-in-breed" motion sensors -- accelerometers and gyroscopes. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely suitors for the struggling chipmaker. STMicroelectronics Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), which competes directly against InvenSense in the motion-sensor market, could buy InvenSense to become the undisputed market leader in gyroscopes and accelerometers. With $1.68 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, STMicro could theoretically acquire InvenSense in an all-cash transaction. STMicro previously supplied Apple with motion sensors for its iPhones, but InvenSense won that spot from the iPhone 6 onward. STMicro struck back at InvenSense by supplying the motion sensor for the Apple Watch, but Apple still apparently uses InvenSense sensors in the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. By gobbling up InvenSense, STMicro would become Apple's primary supplier of gyroscopes and accelerometers, regardless of which brand the iPhone maker picks. But there's also a risk that Apple -- not wanting to let a single supplier gain too much clout -- could start buying its motion sensors from STMicro and Invensense's rival Bosch instead. Sony InvenSense would also be a good fit for Sony (NYSE:SNE), which could use its motion sensors to complement its camera, image sensor, and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. It would be a fairly cheap purchase for Sony, which finished last quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents. InvenSense is mainly known for its smartphone motion sensors, but it also supplies optical image stabilization sensors for cameras. Sony produces its own optical image stabilization sensors, but that unit could benefit from merged technologies and the inclusion of InvenSense's customer list. InvenSense also has a rapidly growing IoT business, which provides motion sensors for wearables, drones, and other devices. That unit would directly complement Sony's acquisition of IoT 4G chipmaker Altair earlier this year and enable it to grow its content share across various connected devices. Integrating InvenSense's motion sensors could also help Sony tighten up the supply chain and reduce operating costs at its mobile unit -- the same reason Apple and Samsung use first-party silicon in many of their own devices. Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's top manufacturer of PC and data center chips, has been stuck in a rut because of weak growth in both markets. Its inability to penetrate the mobile market also forced it to seek growth in other markets, such as IoT modules, programmable chips, non-volatile memory, and depth-sensing cameras. One of Intel's key strategies to expand beyond PCs and data centers is to create all-in-one "reference designs" that enable OEMs to quickly create devices such as drones and VR headsets. These designs bundle together Intel's chips, RealSense depth-sensing cameras, and other first-party components to widen its moat against larger rivals. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel's VR/AR headset reference design, a standalone device dubbed "Project Alloy," is powered by Intel's sixth-generation Core processor and RealSense camera. It's unclear who supplied the gyroscopes and accelerometers, but Intel could certainly beef up that bundle with InvenSense's sensors. The same could also be said about Intel's reference designs for drones or other IoT gadgets. With $17.8 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, InvenSense would be a bite-sized purchase for Intel. But will InvenSense actually be acquired? It makes strategic sense for STMicro, Sony, or Intel to buy InvenSense, but it's also logical to simply wait for InvenSense to become cheaper. With sales slipping and the company struggling to defend its moat against bigger rivals, it seems InvenSense could become even cheaper over the next few quarters. Therefore, investors shouldn't buy InvenSense with the expectation that it could be acquired in the near future. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Insights on Mac's upcoming future Listen | Print By Claudio Buttice     Nov 4, 2016 in Technology 2016 was quite a bad year for Mac users, and many keep asking if Apple still cares about the underwhelming future of what now seems to be a second-rate product. The entire 2016 has been quite devoid of major Mac announcements and updates about the new products, making everyone anxious about what's the real future that Apple devised for this line of goods. Even the new MacBook Pro is long overdue, clearly showing how Apple is neglecting its high-end PCs instead of using these products as a spearhead to drive off competition. While iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini weren't so fortunate and never saw any update, even the MacBook Pro seems to be quite limited with its just 16GB of RAM and Intel’s Core i5 and i7 chip, compared to the forthcoming Microsoft Surface Studio and its innovative touchscreen technology. Apple did not even care about waiting a few more months for the next-generation quad-core Kaby Lake processor to become available before releasing the current model, worrying Mac users with what seemed to be a "we couldn't care less" attitude. One of the most widely advertised features of Macs is their alleged superior security that led many users into thinking that their computers were completely free from all kind of vulnerabilities. Expert users could prevent unauthorized access without any third-party program with a powerful built-in feature to encrypt the various Mac folders, and many new tools like Little Flocker and BlockBlock added further layers of security to an environment that is universally thought of as one the safest around. However, Mac OS X is all but invulnerable to outside attacks, as showed by the recent Russian "Fancy Bear" hacker group hit. Their "Komplex" Trojan did not exploit a software vulnerability: instead, the cyber espionage group simply used a phishing email to unload their payload in the form of an executable code disguised as a PDF. Today's users need to use their own Mac OS X VPNs to protect their browsing much like PC users, losing more and more ground against the simpler and more appealing Windows operating systems. Apple keeps putting Mac products in a declining category of run-of-the-mill classic "keyboard and mouse" devices that, although far from being obsolete yet, is not cutting-edge or avant-garde either. The new MacBook Pro seems to be more optimized for lightness and thinness rather than power and high-end computing features, a strategy that, although viable, yet again sounds much more like 2014 than 2016. Mac users always have been more interested in computer specs rather than design, and even this choice seemed to be at least questionable. If Apple will not renew its entire line of Mac products within a few months, including the largely overlooked iMac and Mac Pro, there's a distinct possibility that the whole line will fail to get through 2017.

Looks Undervalued at Today’s Levels (AAPL) Nov 4, 2016, 11:00 am EST  |  By , Zacks Investment Research     View All   Those of us who have seen Apple Inc. (AAPL) growing unit sales quarter upon quarter despite what may be going on in the PC and smartphone markets, tend to overlook the fact that these things affect Apple too. And how well a company manages these factors relative to peers gives us a fair idea of how it’s really doing. What’s Bitten the PC Market As Intel Corporation (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich said earlier this year, the PC replacement cycle has gotten longer: “Four years was the average, now it has moved to about five to six years.” And that’s mainly because older Intel Sandy Bridge processors are able to run the latest operating systems from Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). But there’s another reason: users in traditional markets have multiple devices taking care of most of their needs while the majority in emerging markets prefers smartphones, tablets, phablets, etc. since these take care of most computing needs. Apple, which has a greater presence in traditional markets, didn’t do well in the September quarter. According to IDC, its worldwide Mac shipments fell 13.0% while U.S. shipments fell 13.2%. Apple lost notable market share. Gartner’s numbers are slightly better: although worldwide shipments declined 13.4%, U.S. shipments were down 10.7%. What About The Smartphone Market? IDC estimates that the overall smartphone market grew a mere 1%, driven by Chinese brands OPPO, vivo and Huawei in that order. Samsung, Apple and the “other“ group declined with Apple declining the least. The highlights of these results is that OPPO and vivo grew triple digits with strength in China because of offline marketing expertise and some Western European countries as part of new athletic sponsorships, according to IDC. OPPO has been more focused on international markets particularly India, while vivo has focused on tier 3 to tier 5 Chinese cities and also grown in India. New phone models are helping the Chinese players. How Organized Is Apple? From the above, two questions come to mind. Why is Apple losing share in the PC market? And second, will its smartphone decline continue, particularly in China? On the call, management explained the seeming lack of demand for Apple devices: “We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory.” and… “We also reduced channel inventory [of iPhones] by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%.” and also… “By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction [of iPhones] was in Greater China.” Most of us don’t buy a phone or a PC everyday so when an upgrade is in the offing, it would be natural to wait for it. This is even truer of enterprise buyers, i.e. the ones that buy in bulk. In Apple’s case, the Mac was due for an upgrade and the iPhone had just got a refresh. 7 Growth Stocks That Should Replace Apple in Your Portfolio What happens to older inventory? Is it a good idea to trash it, discount it, or clear it? Apple took the last option, which is what any management would do unless they were trying to manage the business from quarter to quarter. As a result, the company can now look forward to a seasonally stronger quarter where it can sell a good number of higher-ASP devices. We may expect some bulk purchasing as well because “corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.” Management also quoted survey results from 451 Research indicating demand for iPhones in the U.S.: Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating with purchase intention for this quarter at 75%. Among consumers, the customer satisfaction rating is 97% and purchase intent 65%. But what’s really on the minds of Apple investors?

Shares This Friday, Chinese tech giants Huawei announced they’re joining Intel’s Security Innovation Alliance technology partnering program. As the first company from the Chinese market in the alliance, Huawei plans to provide joint solutions for business that should help against advanced persistent threats (APT) worldwide, and offer business continuity.  Huawei said it will collaborate with Intel Security in ‘multiple areas’, giving one example – the integration of Huawei Big Data intelligence with Intel Security endpoint technology, to defend against APTs.   “In today’s security landscape, collaboration and innovation are more important than ever,” said D.J. Long, Head of Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “We believe that the collaboration between Intel Security and Huawei through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance will help customers expedite the threat defense lifecycle and create more secure environments.”   Liu Lizhu, General Manager of Security Gateway Domain, Switch and Enterprise Gateway Product Line of Huawei, said, “The fast development of cloud-based business, IoT and other technologies means that security protection has become far more complicated. Huawei is very pleased to join the Intel Security Innovation Alliance for win-win collaboration to help customers address the security challenges of detecting and responding against unknown threats and attacks.”  Huawei Security is present in network, cloud and application security, as well as security management. It also has an independent security capacity centre and a number of security products on the market.    Image Credit: J.Lekavicius / Shutterstock Topics huawei intel security intel security innovation alliance apt Advanced Persistent Threats Load Comments GET YOUR FREE eBOOK: LEARNING DOCKER worth £32.38 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Fans Momentarily Get their Thirst Quenched with the Release of the Hybrid Surface Book i7, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 05, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» On October 26, Microsoft launched the Surface Book hybrid which it officially named as Surface Book i7. It is definitely not the long-awaited Microsoft Surface Book 2 but it somehow quenched the thirst of fans for the latest laptop line from the Redmondian company. The following day, it was the turn of Apple to launch its long-awaited 2016 MacBook Pro which prompted tech analysts to deduce that the Surface Book i7 is meant to go head-to-head with the 2016 MacBook Pro or vice versa, notes Neurogadget. The Surface Book i7 offers up to 16 hours of battery life, which is 30% more than the original Surface Book, but it runs on the same processors as the 2016 Macbook Pro range, which is why it is named as i7. Microsoft no longer waited until next year, when the seventh generation Kaby Lake series from Intel will hit the market, so it opened pre-orders for the new Surface Book i7 on the Microsoft Store. Those who pre-ordered the device can get their units as early as November 10. Comparing the two new devices The Surface Book i7 and the 2016 MacBook Pro both look great, have a powerful software, and also come with a high price tag. One thing that seems to go in favor of the Surface Book i7 is the fact that its display is detachable and is also touch screen. The 2016 MacBook Pro is just touch screen. The new Surface Book i7 keeps the same design as the original Surface Book, including the slightly divisive hinge that means the laptop does not fully close. The screen can detach from the body and be used as a tablet. The laptop has a magnesium alloy body. On the other hand, the 2016 MacBook Pro is lighter and thinner than its previous models. It has an all-metal body and keeps the same simple, but stylish look, albeit with a few tweaks, such as a much larger touchpad. The 2016 MacBook Pro is available in two screen sizes – 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch while the Surface Book i7 only comes in one size – 13.5-inch, details Betanews. The 2016 MacBook Pro features Touch ID, so users can log into the laptop using a fingerprint. Surface Book i7 does not have a fingerprint scanner but does have Windows Hello, which uses facial recognition to log the user in. The Surface Book i7 and the 2016 MacBook Pro can both be had in a choice of configurations, so users can opt for a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor. More important among the considerations and comparisons are the prices of the variants. The price for the entry-level 2016 MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, but it would not have the Touch Bar for that. For models with a Touch Bar, the cost is $1,799, particularly for the 13.3-inch display and the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. The price for the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro, with Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and Radeon Pro 450 graphics, starts at $2,399. The price of the Surface Book i7 starts at $1,349, for which the user gets the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. There is also the i7 version, with 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, and it costs $2,399. The 1TB version with 16GB RAM of i7 version is pegged at $3,299. The better deal Critics believe that the Surface Book i7 is the better all around deal, and the screen can be used as a tablet, which is a welcome bonus. The 2016 MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a svelte beast, with good looks, and future-proof ports which might require the user to use a dongle or two, but which will be standard in the coming years. Meanwhile, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 has been previously rumored to come out last month along with the Surface Pro 5. But that did not happen.

Equity indices stumbled in the opening hour as a reversal in crude oil and weakness in the influential technology sector weighed on the broader market. This was the eighth successive drop for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a sixth straight day, declining 28.97 points, or 0.2%, to close at 17,930.67. The Nasdaq Composite fell 47.16 points, or 0.9%, to 5,058.41, as Facebook, one of its largest components, dropped sharply. The S&P 500 finished down 9.28 points, or 0.4%, at a nearly four-month closing low of 2,088.66, with eight of the main 11 sectors closing lower. The tech and health care sectors led the decliners, each with a 1% loss. Eighteen out of thirty Dow components ended lower with shares of Pfizer and Intel dragging on the average. A number of economic reports, including jobless claims, productivity data, factory orders and the nonmanufacturing ISM survey, largely underlined a theme of steady economic growth and were seen as strong enough to justify expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its December meeting. The central bank kept interest rates unchanged Wednesday, but signaled that it's inching closer to a December interest-rate hike. Oil began the day on a modestly higher note, rebounding from its recent losing streak. The energy component has been under pressure in recent days as investors reassess the previously announced OPEC supply freeze agreement and mull over some disappointing weekly inventory data. WTI crude slipped below the $45.00/bbl in the opening hour, finishing down 2.0% at $44.45/bbl. Shares in Facebook closed down 5.7% after the social-media giant warned late Wednesday that growth rates for its advertising revenue will come down meaningfully. Among economic reports expected for the day, the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits at the end of October rose by 7,000 to a three-month high of 265,000, but the rate of layoffs in the U.S. remains extremely low. Initial claims for the week ending October 29 rose by 7,000 to 265,000 (consensus 256,000). Continuing claims for the week ending October 22 decreased by 14,000 to 2.026 million. Meanwhile, American firms and employees boosted their productivity in the third quarter for the first time in 2016, but the longer-term trend is still a poor one that bodes ill for the U.S. economy. Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a 3.1% annual rate in the third quarter (consensus 1.8%). This was the first increase after three consecutive quarterly declines and was further underpinned by an upward revision to second quarter productivity to -0.2% from -0.6%. Separate report showed that factory orders rose 0.3% in September. Meanwhile, ISM services index fell to 54.8% in October from 57.1%, below the 56% forecast. Treasuries finished on a mixed note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished flat (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note finished the day up one basis point (1.81%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 860 million as more than 880 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.

Nicholas New hopes some of it will be worked on by a processor that parses data using laser light, built by his U.K. startup, Optalysys. New says his company’s exotic approach to crunching data can dramatically upgrade a conventional computer by taking over some of the most demanding work in applications such as genomics and simulating weather. “The grunt work can be done by the optics,” he says. Researchers have worked on the idea of using optics rather than electronics to process data for decades, with little commercial traction. But New argues that it is now needed because manufacturers such as Intel admit that they can’t keep improving conventional chips at the pace they used to (see “Moore’s Law Is Dead. Now What?”). Manipulating laser beams encoded with data offers a shortcut on certain tricky computing operations. Optalysys’s technology performs a mathematical function called the Fourier transform by encoding data, say a genome sequence, into a laser beam. The data can be manipulated by making light waves in the beam interfere with one another, performing the calculation by exploiting the physics of light, and generating a pattern that encodes the result. The pattern is read by a camera sensor and fed back into a conventional computer’s electronic circuits. The optical approach is faster because it achieves in a single step what would take many operations of an electronic computer, says New. The technology was enabled by the consumer electronics industry driving down the cost of components called spatial light modulators, which are used to control light inside projectors. The company plans to release its first product next year, aimed at high-performance computers used for processing genomic data. It will take the form of a PCI express card, a standard component used to upgrade PCs or servers usually used for graphics processors. Optalysys is also working on a Pentagon research project investigating technologies that might shrink supercomputers to desktop size, and a European project on improving weather simulations. French startup LightOn, founded earlier this year, has also built a system that uses optical tricks to process data being carried by laser light. The company is targeting a trick used in machine learning that compresses information by multiplying it with random data. That technique is useful, but onerous for conventional computers working with large data sets, says Laurent Daudet, LightOn’s chief technology officer and a professor of physics at the Université Paris Diderot. His system gets the same effect more easily by exploiting the random scattering that naturally occurs when light passes through translucent material. “Computers really suck at this, [but] you can use nature to do it instead,” says Daudet. He and LightOn’s two other founders published results last year showing how that works. The company  is working to show its system can perform other operations, too, and aims to put a new prototype online as a cloud service for others to experiment with, says Daudet. The timing is good for these startups. Recognition that existing chip designs will no longer improve at the exponential pace they used to is making the industry more open to new ideas, says Horst Simon, deputy director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “As conventional chips don’t get faster any more, alternative routes look more attractive,” says Simon. Those alternative routes include quantum computers and chip designs specialized for AI, as well as optical computing systems. Simon doubts that optical technology will take over all kinds of computing, but says it might finally find a practical place. “There may be niche applications where its performance makes sense,” he says.

If accurate, it means at least some early Thunderbolt 3 docks already on the market will not work with Apple’s newest Mac laptop. Apple’s New MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Message from Plugable: On the product page for Plugable’s Thunderbolt 3 product line, the company posted the following note: Update 11/3/16: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Certified Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters (released prior to November 2016). These existing devices use Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge) in combination with the first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected and are disabled by OS X on the new MacBooks. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also made the difficult decision to postpone our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. We’ll continue to post updates with new Thunderbolt™ 3 product and release information as it becomes available. Unknowns There are a bunch of unknowns, starting with whether or not Apple might change its mind on supporting the first generation chips. Thunderbolt 3 has been a tad fluid in terms of specs—it seems quite likely that Apple decided some aspect of this first generation chip cause more problems than is worth it. So…could Apple change its corporate mind? It would be nifty if the company didn’t alienate early adopters of Thunderbolt 3, not to mention those companies looking to press the boundaries just like Apple is doing. We don’t know yet, and Apple hasn’t yet commented on the issue. If and when Apple does comment, we’ll post.

Nayar California's attorney general Kamala Harris (left) and Washington state Senator Pramila Jayapal Washington, Nov. 3: Next week's legislative elections in America concurrent with choosing a new US President will set a new record which few people are talking about: yet it is very important for India and for Americans of Indian origin. The new US Congress will have a record representation by men and women of Indian origin. Women in America are openly exulting that next Tuesday's voting could take female representation in both chambers of Congress to more than 20 per cent for the first time. Also, depending on whether you are a rich American, not-so-rich or a poor citizen, the millionaire class which will proliferate the next Senate has become a hot potato or a matter of pride in the ongoing election campaign. But the record about to be set in legislative representation is a landmark in the history of Indian immigration to the US. Although Indian American presence on Capitol Hill will go up by record numbers, it will still not be as high as in Canada where Punjabi is the fourth most spoken language in its House of Commons. Not yet. If all goes well for Kamala Harris in Tuesday's voting in California, she will become the first American with Indian roots to become a member of the US Senate. Harris is California's incumbent attorney general. In nearby Washington state, Pramila Jayapal is equally on the way to making history for the Indian American community if she is elected - a virtual certainty going by opinion polls - to the US House of Representatives on Tuesday. The US Congress has never had an Indian American woman in its ranks. Jayapal is an incumbent state Senator in Washington. She will replace a retiring Congressman who has a stellar record of helping India and promoting Indo-US friendship although he is racially white. Jim McDermott, one of the founding members of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, represented Seattle and neighbouring areas in the House for just under 28 years. In a part of Silicon Valley which is home to technology firms Apple, Intel, Yahoo! and eBay, Ro Khanna, a former Stanford University lecturer who is only 40, is likely to replace incumbent fellow Democrat Mike Honda. California's curious election law allows the two top contenders from the same party to contest against each other in the poll. Another near certain win next week contributing to the new record is Raja Krishnamoorthi who is contesting in Illinois for a seat being vacated by incumbent Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a fellow Democrat. When Louisiana's Bobby Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, Indian Americans were over the moon. Since Dalip Singh Saund in 1956, no Indian American had gone to Capitol Hill as an elected representative in the lower chamber of Congress. When Jindal was elected Louisiana's governor five years later Indian Americans once again became unrepresented in the US national legislature although their disappointment was tempered in due course by having him - and later in 2011 - Nikki Haley, South Carolina's incumbent governor in two significant gubernatorial positions in America. Ami Bera filled that gap in 2012 when he was elected to the House from California. He and Tulsi Gabbard - who is not Indian, but Hindu - have since become emblematic of Indian causes on Capitol Hill. Bera faces a tough contest this year and Indian Americans fear he may not be re-elected. Although she has only been in a state-level contest the cynosure of this election season for people with Indian roots in this country has been Kesha Ram, who unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primaries for Vermont's Lieutenant Governor. She continues to be a member of Vermont's General Assembly. Her popularity among Indian Americans is owed to her success eight years ago in being elected to the state legislature at the age of 22, the youngest member of the community to win any public office in the US. Meanwhile, widespread expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory in the presidential election have prompted Indian Americans to lobby with her campaign for positions in the next US administration, especially in a Clinton cabinet. Among the Indian American front-runners is Neera Tanden, president of a Democratic-leaning think tank, the Centre for American Progress. Speculation is rife that Tanden could be in the next cabinet as the secretary for health and human services. Clinton has promised that if elected, 50 per cent of her cabinet will be made up of women. Since her victory, if it comes through, is significantly owed to African Americans, Hispanics and Asians, Clinton will go out of her way to ensure ethnic diversity in her administration. Tanden's strength is that she worked for the drafting and adoption of Obamacare formally known as the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama's signature health care reform which Clinton has pledged to uphold. Circles close to John Kerry, the secretary of state who succeeded Clinton when she quit to enter the presidential campaign, indicated that Richard Verma, the incumbent US ambassador to India, could be the next Permanent Representative to the UN, a position with cabinet rank in the American system. Ajay Banga, who headed the US-India Business Council for several years, the president and CEO of Mastercard, is being talked about for a senior economic position in the Clinton administration as is Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general. Other Indian American names doing the rounds are Vivek Murthy, the current US surgeon general, and Raj Shah, whom Obama appointed as head of the US Agency for International Development.  More stories in International Kunis slams sexist Hollywood producer 20 die in Pak mishap    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Gunderson Sat, 05 Nov 2016 - Multithreaded OpenGL Multithreading continues to be hard (although the alternatives are not really a lot better). While debugging a user issue in Nageru, I found and fixed a few races (mostly harmless in practice, though) in my own code, but also two issues that I filed patches for in Mesa. But that's not enough, it seems; there are still issues that are too subtle for me to figure out on-the-fly. But at least with those patches, I can use interlaced video sources in Nageru on Intel GPUs without segfaulting pretty much immediately. My laptop's GPU isn't fast enough to actually run the YADIF interlacer realtime in 1080p60, though, but it's nice at least not take the program down. (These things are super-sensitive to timing, of course, which is probably why I didn't see them when developing the feature a year or so ago.) As usual, NVIDIA's proprietary drivers seem to be near-flawless in this regard. I'm starting to think maybe it's about massive amounts of QA resources. [21:11] | | Multithreaded OpenGL Steinar H.

New Orleans, LA (PRWEB) October 27, 2016 Driving Innovation is a resounding theme of companies large and small in various verticals around the globe. Fall 2016, New Orleans based software company — IDScan.net — decided to inspire millennial college students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to innovate by partnering with Black Enterprise as the exclusive Persona Verification Dev Box Partner of the BE Smart Hackathon sponsored by Toyota. October 9th through 11th, 40 students from 10 HBCUs arrived at the Black Enterprise TechConneXt Summit in Burlingame, CA (Silicon Valley) eager to receive their IDScan.net Web Service API keys to engulf their days and nights with developing and deploying a Minimum Value Product (MVP) based on this year’s theme, In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI). Andrey Stanovnov, CTO of IDScan.net, stated, “IDScan.net is thrilled to provide their technology in the Driving Innovation Hackathon as it fosters growth and innovation in participants that will soon be our future leaders.” Participating schools included Alabama A&M University, Florida A&M University, Hampton University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, North Carolina A&T State University, Southern University and A&M College, and Tuskegee University. Each school was tasked to innovate an iOS app within the Ionic Cloud framework and utilized required APIs provided, which included IDScan.net’s Web Service API. To build the verification component of the app, hackers used IDScan.net’s ID scanning Web Services API. One of the goals of the development was to provide a verification in the app that went beyond just entering a username and password. Participants utilized the ID scanning API to verify the identity of the driver by scanning their ID. Nathaniel J., Associate Tech Editor-Silicon Valley of Black Enterprise and Founder & Chief Digital Architect of VUEmega Technologies, states, “ID verification should not be an afterthought when creating various app innovations for end-users today. One of IDScan.net's goals is to build a trusted community of users that are verified. Because of this, IDScan.net is the best solution not only for this year's hackathon but also for companies that want to ensure a trusted community of users.” This year’s winner was Aggie++ from North Carolina A&T State University (NC A&T). NC A&T’s winning iOS IVI is Let’s Go Black. Let’s Go Black is an iOS application that helps discover a customized road trip adventure exploring Black history and culture, while supporting Black owned small businesses along the way. The app allows users to input parameters of the trip (i.e. theme, distance and starting location), then randomly generates a road trip with specially curated stops that are African American inspired attractions and landmarks. Additionally, the app alerts users when they are within the vicinity of Black owned small businesses, who are members of the Let’s Go Black platform. The 2016 BE Smart Hackathon, sponsored by Toyota was judged by industry leading experts from companies such as Intel and AT&T.

And you use the internet. So there are decent odds that you want to take a picture of yourself voting on Tuesday. Which is totally cool! Just be aware that you may be breaking the law. About half the states in the country have rules prohibiting ballot selfies or other acts involving cameras in voting booths. That includes New York, where a federal judge kept the selfie ban in place this week, and California, where ballot selfies will become legal in 2017 but are still banned for this election. New Hampshire is fine with it, though. NBC has a handy chart that breaks this stuff down, state by state. The history of selfie and ballot photo bans is pretty interesting — a lot of the rules have to do with attempts to prevent vote buying and voter intimidation. But, as many people have argued — including Snapchat’s lawyers, in a friend of the court brief — there’s no evidence that those bans do any good. And there’s a common-sense argument that taking a picture of yourself voting is a good thing, and should be protected as free speech. The good news is that there’s very little record of people being prosecuted for this stuff. If Justin Timberlake got away with it, you’re probably going to be okay, too.

Photograph: Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg/Getty Images Maeve Shearlaw in Marrakech @maeveshearlaw Saturday 5 November 2016 10.52 EDT Last modified on Monday 7 November 2016 12.40 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger What is the future of the internet in Africa? How can tech save lives, educate and light homes, in communities where schools and energy suppliers are failing? For the past three days young innovators, entrepreneurs and blockchain experts convened at the inaugural Africa 4 Tech summit to discuss these questions. Here’s what we learned. Silicon Valley took time to find its roots – African tech hubs will too Silicon Valley, which had input from institutions including Nasa and Stanford University, took time to find its feet, and Africa’s tech sector will too. This is still a nascent space; one with 54 countries that all have “slightly different DNA”according to Juliana Rotich, the co-founder of Ushahidi and the iHub tech space in Nairobi, Kenya. “Of course entrepreneurship is entrepreneurship and we can learn a lot from Silicon Valley, but this is a very different environment ... in Kenya we only got the internet six years ago,” she adds. A day in the digital life of Africa Read more Not all tech start-ups have to save lives, making money is OK too There are tech companies that have a positive impact on the world – companies that save lives and fight climate change – but that’s not the only story, says Rotich. “If you have a start-up that creates money and creates jobs, that is also something to be celebrated.” There is a school of thought that argues that Africa needs business, not aid, to prosper. Perhaps the same logic should be applied to the tech sector. Disruption in Africa is the opposite to disruption in the west Africa is fertile ground for tech disruption, but there’s a fundamental difference to how this happens in the west, where technology attempts to bypass existing systems. In Africa many of these systems don’t exist, so it’s about creating solutions for things like installing formal economies, says Stéphan Eloïse Gras, founder of Africa 4 Tech. Gras cites Uber as the best example of this. In the west the company is said to be disruptive because it provides a taxi service by connecting drivers with passengers without owning any cars – a system heavily criticised for neglecting workers’ rights. But Uber in Lagos actually formalises the economy, giving drivers a way to register their cars, a standardised way to collect money and the ability to track the journeys they’ve been on. “A trend we should all pay attention to,” says Gras. Facebook was a solution to Mark Zuckerberg’s immediate needs, African tech start-ups should adopt the same approach Mark Zuckerberg’s $51.3bn fortune and almost guaranteed audience with any global leader came from one wish: to find out more about the personal status of his classmates at Harvard University. By 2005 “The Facebook” was Facebook.com; 10 years later it was being used by one in seven people worldwide. The lesson for African entrepreneurs is to look for the solutions close to home before thinking about scale. Africa 4 Tech (@Africa4Tech) Have you heard of Sam Kodo (#Togo) ? Meet him and 39 african innovators at our #event in #Marrakesh Nov 2 - 4 #edtech #smartbag #mwfcon16 pic.twitter.com/8sA4U7zuzB October 17, 2016 Sam Kodo, a young innovator at the conference, is one of many doing this. He created a low cost laptop for school children in rural Toga in the shape of a bag, with a screen on one side and a solar panel on the other to charge the device. At $150 (£120) it’s more affordable than tablets, which cost about $300, and while most of his customers are in his country, he has already sold 500 machines to the US. Africa's most innovative – and controversial – tech hacks Read more Employ more women and you’ll make more money According to Intel, closing the gap between the number women and men who run tech companies could add $430-$530bn to the global economy. And in Africa, “it’s important for women to be part of the story from the very beginning”, says Rotich, who encourages all new African start-ups to include women as co-founders. Not only does the data show that you will be more successful, at least half of your customers will be women. “And if you try to add them later it won’t necessarily work.” Education is choking Africa’s creative talent before it has a chance to develop From primary school to university, Africa’s education system is missing opportunities to spot and nurture entrepreneurial talent, say experts in the technology education sector. TRUE AFRICA (@_TRUEAfrica) 'If there's a problem with education in Africa, it's due to the government.' @kwame42 from Ecole 42 tells it how it is #edtech #A4T November 3, 2016 “Even if you have an idea, you don’t know where to go with it,” says young innovator Larissa Uwase, who recently set up a company creating new food products from the sweet potato, a staple crop in Rwanda. Africa’s budding entrepreneurs often have to rely on after-school clubs for coding, applying for specific mentoring schemes or, in the case of Kodo, start teaching themselves robotics aged eight. But young Africans still want to be next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs There might not be enough support in the tech sector, but young people still dream of creating the next big thing. “People used to want to be musicians or football players, but now we are in the trend of technology, students are inspired by innovation,” says Kodo. In Rwanda there are a lot of ideas but “support with implementation is the problem”, according to Uwase, who adds that 60% of the start-ups in her country fail due to a lack of support or investment. Only 20 people in the world truly understand blockchain – but it could be the solution to light up Africa ENGIE Innovation (@innovbyENGIE) #BlockChain in #energy @LO3energy #minigrid #A4T pic.twitter.com/ob0uZ3SjGs November 4, 2016 According to Rick Dudley, there are only about 20 people like him: people who truly understand how blockchain works and what it can be used to do. The technology behind the digital currency bitcoin creates digital property without the need for a central authority. It is currently being used to run the payment system for a micro energy grid in Brooklyn, New York, where a handful of houses create electricity with solar panels and sell it to their neighbours, bypassing the national power grid. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 20m households live off-grid, the possibilities of a such a bottom-up approach are endless.

New York, NY (PRWEB) November 05, 2016 “We’ve never seen such an advantageous position for Chinese investors,” said Bril Wang, President of the CPC. “Chinese buyers are taking over 23% of the global M&A. Industries that just became stable in the US are still emerging in China.” “The window of opportunities is still open, the question is whether and when it will close,” said Marcus Cole, professor of Stanford Law School. Forty five investor professionals joined panel discussions, fireside chats on topics of high return investment areas and risk control, future investment trends, and collaborative investment opportunities between the U.S. and China. In terms of highlights from the discussions – Carmen Chang from NEA, one of the most influential venture backers of Uber, shared her insider opinion of the Didi and Uber China merger. James Huang from KPCB looks ahead to further developments in the healthcare industry and the future of China-US cooperation in this field. Patrick Eggen from Qualcomm Ventures, Paulo Pereira from GE, and Tim Merel from Digi-Capital, also vigorously discussed topics including artificial intelligence (AI), virtual-enhanced hybrid reality (VR / AR / MR) and robotics. David Chao, cofounder of DCM predicts a strong relationship between investment trends and demographic distribution. Separately, famous Chinese angel investor Bob Xu gave an opening speech on “The fourth Startup Wave” along with Yihang Yang, Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in San Francisco, who discussed cross border investment growth between US and China; Letitia Chow, representative of Stanford FARM and Bril Wang, president of the CPC. Hans Tung from GGV Capital, Jonathan Qiu from Sky9 and Yong Liu from WI Harper shared their experience on investing in China during the past decade, including on e-commerce, mobile, O2O, fintech and AI. On the second day, Cameron Teitelman from Stanford StartX and Minglan Wang from Zhongguancun Development Group led a discussion on incubator difference between US and China. The conference also included enterprise investment, consumer investment and investment innovation discussions with industry experts like Aymerik Renard from Sandisk Ventures, Zhang Qian from ChinaAMC Fund, Sanjit Singh Dang from Intel Capital, Rashmi Gopinath from Microsoft Ventures, Robert Neivert from 500 Startups, Michael Cohen from SAIC, Michael Daugherty from AngelList, Ran Wang from Qihoo 360 and so on. “State-owned enterprises and public listed companies in China are taking advantage of the current exchange rate, allocating high-quality assets overseas and leveraging domestic growth based on China's huge market,” added Bril Wang, President of the CPC “It makes good sense since in 2016, currency issuance in China is expected to be 13%, and by the end of the year, China's total money supply (M2) will exceed the sum of the U.S. and the EU, reaching 23 trillion US dollars (calculated with current exchange rate). However, the SDR weight of RMB is 10.9% compare to USD 41.7% and EUR 30.9% starting Oct 2016. Current foreign exchange reserve of China is only $3.2 trillion USD. There aren’t enough recognized funds available for Chinese buyers. We do see, however, this condition will change in the long run.” About Cardinal Pitch Club (CPC) Cardinal Pitch Club (CPC) founded by Stanford affiliates in April, 2015, devotes to connecting our network startups with some of the Bay Area’s best recognized VCs. With growing requests from Chinese capital, CPC also helps our startups with exit opportunities like cross border M&A, share acquisition of Pre-IPO companies, e.g. Uber, Airbnb etc. For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/10/prweb13794556.htm Latest News Flipbook Animation Software FlipHTML5 is Suitable for Interactive Content Publishing Konstantinos Kazinakis – United Bunkers Investors Corporation – Offers Guidelines for Successful Implementation of Shipping and Logistics Ad Age Recognizes BusinessOnline as One of the Best Places to Work 2016 Najib Babul – On the Accuracy of Pain Memory Julius Numavicius – On the Importance of Philanthropy Suprema to Unveil BioMini Slim 2, World’s Slimmest FAP20 Fingerprint Scanner at TRUSTECH 2016 Greenberg Traurig’s Environmental Practice Receives First-Tier Ranking in U.S. News – Best Lawyers 2017 ‘Best Law Firms’ Edition Secureone Security Opens Secureone LiveScan Fingerprinting in Mesa, AZ Greenberg Traurig’s Angel Taveras, Former Providence Mayor, to Speak about the “Politics of Public Sector Pensions” Cosmetic Town Relaunches Its Website with a New Design and New Features © 2015 SSUChronicle.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Excelsior's Ahead-Of-Time Java Compiler Now Available For ARM Platforms NOVOSIBIRSK, Russia, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Excelsior LLC, a well-established vendor of compliant Java SE technology implementations, has announced today the general availability of its first product for Java developers targeting ARM-based devices, Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM. Logo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161103/435820LOGO    Photo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161103/435821 Excelsior JET Control Panel screenshot Excelsior JET Embedded is a complete implementation of the Java SE Embedded technology, enhanced with an Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) optimizing native code compiler. It helps vendors of Java-powered devices protect their intellectual property and improve the run time characteristics of their Java code. When run on traditional JVMs equipped with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, Java applications are known to start slowly and exhibit bad response times until the JIT compiler kicks in and compiles the performance-critical pieces down to native code. These may be non-issues for a server-side enterprise application that runs for many days on a cluster of multiprocessor servers. In the context of an embedded device, however, fast application startup and immediate demonstration of short, consistent response times are often among the top requirements. An AOT compiler enables embedded Java developers to circumvent the restrictions of their target hardware. “AOT compilation not only reduces the startup time of Java applications and eliminates the “JIT non-determinism”, as one of our prospects has put it, but also makes reverse engineering of application code much more expensive, which is good for security and intellectual property protection,” said Dmitry Leskov, Excelsior’s Director of Marketing. The ARM architecture flavors initially targeted by Excelsior JET Embedded are ARMv7-A with VFPv3-D16 extension or better, and 32-bit ARMv8-A. Future versions will also support 64-bit ARMv8 CPUs; support for the lower-end processors will be driven by customer demand. Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM and Intel-based platforms is available for evaluation and purchase immediately direct from Excelsior at https://www.excelsiorjet.com/embedded. Pricing depends on the customer’s choice of a support plan and project parameters. Excelsior is an Oracle Java Licensee, so, on the one hand, its product has passed the official compatibility test suite and includes Oracle’s implementation of the Java SE Platform API, but, on the other hand, the use of a licensed Java implementation in an embedded device requires paying per-unit royalties to Oracle. Also released today is Excelsior JET 11.3 for desktop and server platforms based on Intel CPUs: https://www.excelsiorjet.com/evaluate About Excelsior LLC Excelsior LLC provides advanced Java-compatible solutions and software development services with particular focus on optimizing compilers, high performance runtime environments, and the Java technology. Excelsior is a Java Authorized Licensee. The company’s flagship product, Excelsior JET, is a complete solution for acceleration, protection, and deployment of Java applications.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Curtiss-Wright Debuts Safety Certifiable 3U VPX Graphics Modules for Avionics <!– a href="/advertise.php" title="Tired of Google arrogant behavior, questionable practices and constant revenue decrease" alt="Tired of Google arrogant behavior, questionable practices and constant revenue decrease" target=_new> –> Curtiss-Wright’s Defense Solutions division announced that it has expanded its portfolio of DO-254/DO-178C safety certifiable COTS products with the introduction of two new rugged 3U VPX high performance graphics processor modules. Based on AMD’s latest embedded Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the Radeon™ E8860, both of these multi-head graphics cards support the long lifecycle availability required for defense and aerospace programs. Through the use of a suite of CoreAVI® software drivers and supported by the embedded industry’s longest component supply program, availability for VPX3-717 and VPX3-719 module hardware and software is ensured for 15+ years. Designed for use in safety certifiable applications, these size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C)-optimized modules were developed to meet DO-254 DAL C and DO-178C DAL A certification. DO-254 and DO-178C certification artifact kits, available from Curtiss-Wright, ease platform certification, speed time to market, and significantly reduce the cost and risk of developing safety certifiable electronics subsystems for commercial and military aviation platforms. “We are very excited to announce these new safety certifiable rugged graphics cards,” said Lynn Bamford, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Defense Solutions division. “These SWaP optimized 3U VPX graphics engines enable system designers to speed the design of DO-254/DO-178B safety certifiable avionics systems, eliminating the high cost of custom solutions. Even better, they feature unmatched 15+ year availability for hardware and software, a true boon for long lifecycle aerospace and defense programs.” About the VPX3-719: Built-in HD-SDI Video Capture and Output Format Conversion The VPX3-719 is ideal for applications that require video capture and HD-SDI video interfaces. It supports extremely low latency video capture, graphics generation and overlay, and display output conversion. The card’s Radeon GPU is supported with up to six independent and simultaneous graphics outputs selectable from 4x DVI, 2x HD-SDI, and 2x analog RGBHV or STANAG interfaces. The VPX3-719 provides 2 GB of dedicated video memory, and a hardware accelerated video compression encoder and decoder. It features built-in video capture and format conversion and provides two channels of video capture from HD-SDI, analog RGBHV, or STANAG sources. The video data is transferred directly to processor or GPU memory. About the VPX3-717: XMC Expansion Site Delivers System Flexibility The VPX3-717 provides system designers with a higher level of architecture flexibility. Unlike the VPX3-719, it provides an on-module XMC mezzanine expansion site, which can be configured with a wide variety of XMC card types. The card can also be configured with a Power Architecture®, Intel® or ARM®-based processor XMC single board computer (SBC) enabling single-slot graphics plus SBC solutions. I/O support includes six independent DVI outputs, two of which can also be configured to support a dual-link DVI port for higher resolutions. One channel of analog RGBHV is also supported. Software Support Graphics software API support includes OpenGL®1.2 and OpenGL ES 2.0 for embedded applications, and OpenGL SC 1.0.1 and OpenGL SC 2.0 designed for safety critical and certifiable applications. Codec support for MPEG2 and H.264 encode and decode functionality is also offered. Software support for both graphics modules includes RTOS driver support for Power Architecture, Intel, and ARM VPX and XMC processor modules. Operating environment support includes Linux, Wind River® VxWorks®, Green Hills Software INTEGRITY®, Lynx Software Technologies LynxOS® and Microsoft® Windows®.

The Consumer Electronics Show is one of the biggest tech events of the year, similar to Mobile World Congress, and we expect CES 2017 to showcase a lorry load of new gadgets, TVs, cars and initiatives that'll take our breath away. It will also outline what to expect from the year ahead. Here's everything you need to know about CES 2017. What is CES 2017? CES - the Consumer Electronics Show - is a tech conference held in January in Las Vegas, Nevada, where companies hold keynotes and presentations, as well as staff show floor booths, with the purpose of announcing and demoing new tech. It's been an annual event since 2004. CES 2016 was a record-breaking year, with a total attendance of 177,393. The exhibition space spanned 2.47 million net square feet. When is CES 2017? This year's show will be held from 3 January to 8 January 2017, although most of the breaking news will occur within the first day or so. The official press days for CES 2017 are 3 and 4 January, which is when you can expect the major press conferences and big announcements. Which companies will be at CES 2017? Well, on 3 January, aka Media Day of CES 2017, the following companies are scheduled to give keynotes: Qualcomm, LG, Bosch, Panasonic, TCL, HiSense, Casio, Samsung, Hyundai, Intel, ZTE Corporation, and Sony. What will be announced at CES 2017? Virtual reality Microsoft Microsoft recently announced budget VR headsets were coming with support for the Windows 10 Creator Update. We therefore might see Windows 10 VR headsets from HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer - alongside laptops, monitors, and desktops. HTC might even unveil a standalone, wire-free version of the HTC Vive, which is codenamed Oasis, at CES 2017.  Televisions LG Last year, we saw Ultra HD 4K displays from Sony, LG, Philips, Samsung, Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL, so we expect to see these same companies refresh their ranges for 2017. We're also expecting to see more manufacturers jumping being Ultra HD Blu-ray, especially Sony. Automobiles 1. We founded a company. #FaradayFuture 2. We created a concept. #FFZERO1 3.

Faraday Future is already teasing a few concepts it might unveil at CES 2017. Drones Pocket-lint Drones made a big splash at the last show - especially the fixed-wing, autopilot Parrot Disco. We therefore expect to see more drones this year. Smartphones Pocket-lint We saw the reveal of the Huawei Mate 8 at CES 2016, but the Chinese firm has already previewed the Huawei Mate 9. It'll be interesting to see what other companies plan to use CES 2017 to announce new phones, if any. Wearables Samsung and Fitbit could use CES 2017 to update their wrist wearables. We'll know more in the coming weeks. Sections Gadgets Google Wi-Fi now available to buy: How does the mesh router work?

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 8 Intel Core i5-7600K review published by Chinese tech site by Mark Tyson on 4 November 2016, 13:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadasq Add to My Vault: The same Chinese tech site that published the Sapphire Radeon RX 470D NITRO review we mentioned in the news this morning has broken NDA to publish a full review of the Intel Core i5-7600K desktop PC processor. PCOnline's review includes all manner of details, performance and comparison charts. In essence, the Kaby Lake Core i5-7600K chip runs about 10 per cent faster than the previous generation Skylake Core i5-6600K but much of the performance gain comes from higher default base/boost clockspeeds. Furthermore, the new HD 630 graphics are very similar in spec and performance to HD 530 graphics. The GPU has however gained various hardware de-coding/encoding capabilities which might be valuable to frequent video makers and watchers. Comparison of Core i5 Parameters of Three Generations in 14nm Process CPU model Core i5-7600K Core i5-6600K Core i5-5675C Core code Kaby Lake Skylake Broadwell Interface Type LGA 1151 LGA 1151 LGA 1150 Core thread 4/4 4/4 4/4 Frequency (GHz) 3.8-4.2 3.5-3.9 3.1-3.6 Memory support DRR3L-1600 / DDR4-2133 DRR3L-1600 / DDR4-2133 DDR3-1600 Built-in GPU HD 630 HD 530 Iris Pro 6200 Number of EU units 24 24 48 Level 3 cache 6MB 6MB 4MB Level 4 cache - - 128MB eDRAM Process 14nm 14nm 14nm TDP 91W 91W 65W   As you can see tabulated above, the Core base/boost frequencies have received a worthwhile uplift in the new Kaby Lake chip. Looking at this aspect more closely, PCOnline put together the comparison table below:   CPU model Core i5-7600K Core i5-6600K Base frequency 3.8 GHz 3.5 GHz Single-core maximum Core frequency 4.2 GHz 3.9 GHz Dual-core highest frequency 4.1 GHz 3.8 GHz Three-core highest frequency 4.1 GHz 3.7 GHz Quad-core highest frequency 4.0 GHz 3.6 GHz   I've collected some of the review benchmark results together and you can click the thumbnails below to see them full size. PCOnline used standards such as wPrime, WinRAR, and CineBench to compare the new Core i5-7600K with the Skylake Core i5-6600K and Core i7-6700K. As well as the 'CPU tests' embedded below it ran some gaming and graphics focussed tests.   The reviewer concludes that, while the Kaby Lake processors might not be worth waiting for, Intel's 200 series motherboards will be attractive for enthusiasts. It is reasoned that these (backwards compatible with Skylake processor) motherboards with their PCIe lanes boost, new tech and interfaces support will be the star attraction this time around. Last but not least, the review suggests these new Kaby Lake desktop processors will be available from around the time of CES 2017 (early January).

Register today! Posted by MarcelTimmer - Fri 04 Nov 2016 13:27 It looks like the same processor as the 6600k with higher baseclocks. Posted by Andy14 - Fri 04 Nov 2016 14:01 Going to be interesting to see how this (and it's i7 relation) overclocks. Currently I'm waiting until Jan for the 7700K, Z270 and 1080Ti so I'm hoping there's similar headroom for the SCAN boys to clock this like the current Skylakes. Posted by this_is_gav - Fri 04 Nov 2016 15:27 So the new 7600K doesn't even beat the 6700K. I specifically didn't use the word “can't” there, as I'm sure if they wanted to they'd be able to sail past with the 7600K as well as the 7700K. I realise that the 6700K has hyperthreading and is 0.2GHz faster, but these incremental releases are just frustrating now. It doesn't bode well for Zen, as Intel will know where Zen is at, and yet they don't feel pressured enough to even do anything for their new chip over what they've done with every other incremental increase since the i7s of 2008 (which are still perfectly capable now). Eight years with pretty much sod all progress. I've not been following any Zen rumours and I wasn't getting my hopes up for Zen, and expected it to slot in roughly where the 6600K is at stock, but even that looks like a distant hope now. I just want some competition, for someone to actually move us forward. Posted by MRFS - Fri 04 Nov 2016 18:33 I don't know Chinese: what's the “PCIe lanes boost”? Posted by DDY - Fri 04 Nov 2016 21:46 MRFS I don't know Chinese: what's the “PCIe lanes boost”? I think that refers to the extra few PCIe lanes the 200 series PCH offers over the 100 series.

New Masters of the Universe Toys Announced It Turns Out Rats Are Actually Ticklish More Tech New MacBook Pro Taken Apart by iFixit, Found to Contain (Not Very Repairable) Computer Parts By Ryan Whitwam 11.04.2016 :: 8:30AM EST RyanWhitwam Stay on target Apple Drops USB-C Dongle and Accessory Prices Following Criticism 2016 MacBook Pro Leak Shows Off OLED Magic Toolbar Apple announced new MacBook computers the other day, and one of them doesn’t have function keys. Instead, it’s got a touch bar display. Weird, right? That one isn’t out yet, but the new MacBook (the one with all the buttons) has fallen into the clutches of the electronic murderers at iFixit. Even if we don’t get to see how that touch bar looks on the inside, there’s a lot of new stuff to see in the 2016 MacBook Pro as its torn asunder. Getting into MacBook’s is old hat by now — just remove a few of Apple’s traditional pentalobe screws, pry up the case, and you’re in. The power connector is secured with a large security screw, which is new this year. The trackpad is also easier to remove this time, whereas the last MacBook trapped its cabling under the battery. Speaking of the battery, it was glued in pretty well. The capacity is 27% lower than the previous MacBook Pro, but Apple says improvements in hardware mean the battery life is the same. Going after the core components, iFixit found the SSD was very easy to remove, but it uses a new shape and pin configuration. Next to the vibration-resistant fan are the speaker drivers. The new MacBook Pro has large speaker grilles on either side of the keyboard, but most of that is fake. There are only two small holes for the drivers on each side. Apple talked up its new thermal control system at the event, but it turns out all that means is putting a few screws in different places (sad trombone). On the logic board (that’s a motherboard in PC-speak) you’ll find the Intel CPU, LPDDR3 RAM, WiFi module, storage controller, and more. The display comes off fairly easily after removing the spring mechanism that holds the display cable flat. iFixit gave the 2016 MacBook a repairability score of just 2 out of 10 because of the glued in battery, pentalobe screws, soldered in RAM, and proprietary SSD. Hey, at least the trackpad is easy to take out.

The encryption software market size is estimated to grow from USD 3.05 billion in 2016 to USD 8.94 billion by 2021, at an estimated CAGR of 24.0%. The encryption software market is driven by factors such as increasing need to safeguard critical business information against advanced threats, manifestation of dynamic business environment, and compliance to cyber security guidelines and regulations. However, increasing operational costs and emergence of hardware-based full disk encryption limit the growth of encryption software market. The cloud encryption segment is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, due to the increased adoption of cloud-based storage and applications across various business processes. Increased intensity and volume of cyber-attacks have further increased data security concerns for organization that have adopted cloud for data storage. Disk encryption will have largest market size in 2016, as data storage disks are also susceptible to cyber attacks. Moreover, with the emergence of BYOD trend, the loss and theft of mobile devices comprising business data, further increases the data security concerns. The organizations are steadily growing their partnership networks in order to deploy the encryption software solutions across the globe. Thus, the managed services segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. However, professional services segment is expected to have the largest market size in 2016. APAC includes emerging economies, such as China, Japan, and India, which are rapidly deploying encryption software solutions. APAC is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This is primarily due to the increasing instances of severe cyber-attacks in verticals such as BFSI and IT & Telecom with the surging volume payments and transactions taking place over the internet. Furthermore, North America is expected to have the largest market size in 2016.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Excelsior LLC, a well-established vendor of compliant Java SE technology implementations, has announced today the general availability of its first product for Java developers targeting ARM-based devices, Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161103/435820LOGO    Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161103/435821 Excelsior JET Control Panel screenshot Excelsior JET Embedded is a complete implementation of the Java SE Embedded technology, enhanced with an Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) optimizing native code compiler. It helps vendors of Java-powered devices protect their intellectual property and improve the run time characteristics of their Java code. When run on traditional JVMs equipped with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, Java applications are known to start slowly and exhibit bad response times until the JIT compiler kicks in and compiles the performance-critical pieces down to native code. These may be non-issues for a server-side enterprise application that runs for many days on a cluster of multiprocessor servers. In the context of an embedded device, however, fast application startup and immediate demonstration of short, consistent response times are often among the top requirements. An AOT compiler enables embedded Java developers to circumvent the restrictions of their target hardware. "AOT compilation not only reduces the startup time of Java applications and eliminates the "JIT non-determinism", as one of our prospects has put it, but also makes reverse engineering of application code much more expensive, which is good for security and intellectual property protection," said Dmitry Leskov, Excelsior's Director of Marketing. The ARM architecture flavors initially targeted by Excelsior JET Embedded are ARMv7-A with VFPv3-D16 extension or better, and 32-bit ARMv8-A. Future versions will also support 64-bit ARMv8 CPUs; support for the lower-end processors will be driven by customer demand. Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM and Intel-based platforms is available for evaluation and purchase immediately direct from Excelsior at https://www.excelsiorjet.com/embedded. Pricing depends on the customer's choice of a support plan and project parameters. Excelsior is an Oracle Java Licensee, so, on the one hand, its product has passed the official compatibility test suite and includes Oracle's implementation of the Java SE Platform API, but, on the other hand, the use of a licensed Java implementation in an embedded device requires paying per-unit royalties to Oracle. Also released today is Excelsior JET 11.3 for desktop and server platforms based on Intel CPUs: https://www.excelsiorjet.com/evaluate About Excelsior LLC Excelsior LLC provides advanced Java-compatible solutions and software development services with particular focus on optimizing compilers, high performance runtime environments, and the Java technology. Excelsior is a Java Authorized Licensee. The company's flagship product, Excelsior JET, is a complete solution for acceleration, protection, and deployment of Java applications.

Known as Wi-Fi Certified WiGig, the standard operates in 60GHz spectrum, which is less congested and complements existing Wi-Fi operating in 2.4GHz and 5GHz, to enable multi-gigabit performance for a range of applications such as wireless docking, augmented reality/virtual reality, multimedia streaming, gaming, and networking applications. WiGig devices use beamforming WiGig uses wider channels in 60GHz to transmit data efficiently at multi-gigabit per second speeds and with low latency at distances of up to 10 meters. WiGig devices use beamforming to focus a directed signal between devices, to eliminate interference from nearby devices and to enable high performance even in dense 60GHz environments. Wider channels enable WiGig devices to achieve data rates of up to 8Gbps, allowing users to download an HD movie in a few seconds. This level of performance is critical to delivering a wired-grade experience for a variety of in-room and outdoor line-of-sight scenarios. “Wi-Fi Alliance certification has a strong history of accelerating broad technology adoption across the industry, and we expect 2017 to be a breakout year for WiGig on the heels of Wi-Fi CERTIFIED program availability,” says Phil Solis, research director, ABI Research. “The ecosystem for WiGig spans the mobile, PC and consumer electronics industries across the consumer, enterprise, and service provider markets. Devices will leverage the brand and ubiquity of Wi-Fi for continued momentum across these industries.” Strong complement to Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WiGig is a strong complement to Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac. WiGig delivers benefits for existing networks, and enables a diverse range of new wireless experiences, including scenarios envisioned for 5G. Multi-band Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products supporting 2.4, 5, and 60 GHz allow handoff between frequency bands, selecting the most appropriate band and data rate for the application and surrounding environmental conditions. WiGig devices will range from smartphones, portable PCs, tablets, and access points, to home entertainment and consumer electronics. ABI Research forecasts 180 million WiGig chipsets will ship to the smartphone market in 2017, with smartphone chipsets accounting for almost half of the 1.5 billion total market shipments in 2021. As part of the Wi-Fi ecosystem, WiGig delivers the highest level of security, and multi-band devices will interoperate with more than eight billion deployed Wi-Fi products. “Wi-Fi has delighted users for more than 15 years, and WiGig now gives users even higher performance in a rich variety of applications unleashing an unparalleled Wi-Fi experience,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “WiGig further expands the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED portfolio into 60 GHz, and will augment existing and developing Wi-Fi programs and technologies. “ Test bed for interoperability certification The first Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WiGig products which comprise the test bed for interoperability certification are: * Dell Latitude™ E7450/70 * Intel Tri-Band Wireless * Peraso 60GHz USB Adapter Reference Design Kit * Qualcomm Technologies 802.11ad Wi-Fi client and router solution (based on the QCA9500 chipset) * Socionext 802.11ad Reference Adapter For more information, please visit: http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified-wigig ———————————- Industry response to WiGig: “The launch of the certification program is a key milestone in the development and market deployment of WiGig technology. Our customers can be confident that products carrying this globally recognized stamp of approval meet industry standards of security and interoperability, and in partnership with us they are able to quickly bring to market a wide-range of exciting products.” – Mark Barrett, CMO at Blu Wireless Technology, a global leader in WiGig Intellectual Property licensing   “WiGig is an exciting technology that is critical in a connected world with new and emerging use cases.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Carla Schroder November 3, 2016 Enterprise Linux Showdown: Red Hat Enterprise Linux red-hat-linux.jpg In this series, we will contrast and compare Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Canonical's Ubuntu Linux, and SUSE Enterprise Linux. This article focuses on RHEL, which promises super-reliability and long support cycles. Creative Commons Zero In our amazing Linux world, we have not one, not two, but three, count 'em, three major-league enterprise Linux distributions: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Canonical's Ubuntu Linux, and SUSE Enterprise Linux. In this series, we will contrast and compare all three. Each one is so large it would take a book to thoroughly cover them, so we'll hit the high points of major products, services, important partnerships, and support. Red Hat Enterprise Linux Background Red Hat, like SUSE, is one of the oldest Linux distributions, founded in 1993. As a foundational distribution, it spawned a large family of derivatives, including Caldera, Mandrake, Turbolinux, Yellow Dog, and Red Flag. In 2003, Red Hat Linux split into Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Fedora Linux, making a clear distinction between the commercial enterprise version and the free community version. Fedora is 100% free and open source software (FOSS); it showcases new technologies while providing a good usable system. RHEL promises super-reliability and long support cycles. Each release is supported for 10 years, and RHEL 5 customers can purchase extended support beyond ten years. rhel-7-boxshot.png Used with permission Courtesy of Red Hat Red Hat's code is open, and anyone can take it for free and clone it or build competitive derivatives. CentOS and Scientific Linux are popular clones, and competitor Oracle maintains its own Oracle Unbreakable Linux clone. This exactly the same as RHEL, with one difference: customers have the option of using Oracle's customized kernel in place of the RHEL kernel. Even so, RHEL is one of the big open source success stories and was the first open source business to reach $1 billion in revenues, and in 2016 cracked the $2 billion mark. Getting RHEL For Free Linux users are used to getting great software free of cost, even though that is not a requirement of most FOSS licenses. Users who want RHEL for free can build it from source RPMs (which is not a trivial task) or use one of the clones. A third option is to get the official binaries from their Get Started download page, which has images for bare metal and virtual machines. This is a self-supported, free of cost version that is the same as the paid version, and it uses all the same tools including Subscription Manager and the Red Hat Customer Portal. You have to register and join the Red Hat Developer Program, and you may not use it as a production server -- only for testing and development. Read all about it at FAQ: no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite. Many individual products have live online demos and free 30-day downloads. Buying Red Hat You can talk to the nice Red Hat salespeople, who really are nice and knowledgeable, and you also have the option of purchasing online. Product Line RHEL includes almost everything under the sun: the Linux operating system, JBoss Middleware, KVM-based hypervisor, cloud, storage, mobile development and management platforms, desktop, workstation, Internet of Things, and of course all of the major servers and productivity applications that are included in most Linux distributions. It runs on everything from embedded devices to mainframes and supercomputers. As containers are all the rage now, check out Red Hat's Atomic Host. This is a specialized RHEL 7 scaled-down and optimized to run in containers in Docker format. Atomic Host simplifies the complexity of developing and running containers by providing a central management console for creating and managing your containers; it incorporates Docker, Kubernetes, SELinux, Systemd, and other standard components. See the Product Documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host for a complete walk-through of installation and configuration. This is a good starting point if you're new to container technologies. We hear so much hype about containers and Internet of Things that it fades into background noise. To get a good perspective on the amazing possibilities of these technologies, watch "Microservices and Smart Networks Will Save the Internet," which brings it all into the real world. Red Hat has partnerships with many major tech vendors, including Dell, SAP, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, Amazon, and, yes, Microsoft. Like most FOSS projects you get interoperability rather than lock-in. What about the desktop? Red Hat has a desktop and a workstation edition, but they've always been quiet about them. I've never understood why so many businesses stick with Microsoft Windows on the desktop when it's such an overpriced hassle. Linux on the enterprise desktop makes perfect sense: way more secure, stable, lightweight, easy to customize, and easy to manage centrally. Just one of life's mysteries, I suppose. Management tools are the #1 most important tools in the datacenter, in my needlessly humble opinion. Red Hat's Satellite provides a central console for full management of the entire Red Hat stack: provisioning, configuration, license tracking, configuration, and auditing. Visit the ecosystem catalog to look up certified hardware, software, and service providers. Support Red Hat's customer and product support generally gets high marks. They also offer a full complement of training and certification courses. These are tailored for Red Hat software, but Linux and FOSS are pretty much the same everywhere so everything you learn is transferable to other Linux distributions and open source software. Red Hat's documentation is famous for being excellent and thorough, with manuals for everything, plus videos and knowledge base. Cons So far, this probably sounds like a gooey love letter. In a way it is, because Red Hat is a fine company that has been a major supporter and funder of FOSS development from its inception. Their products and support are first-rate. Of course, everyone has their quirks and flaws. These are some that I have experienced: The Mystery of the Broken Download. When RHEL 6 was released, I tried to download a 30-day evaluation. I could not get a full download, so I filed a bug ticket. I received many nice replies but not one helpful reply. So then I requested the DVD. At the time, the evaluation disk cost $25, and as a tech journalist I figured I should receive a free review copy. Again, my request was met with abundant niceness, but nobody could just pop a disk in the mail. I gave up and found a friend who gave me access to his RHEL server to check it out. Ancient Software. Many businesses hate to upgrade anything ever. They think computers are like staplers: when you buy a stapler, you have a stapler for life. Who upgrades staplers? Nobody, that's who, so why upgrade computers? This causes problems when you want to run applications that have newer dependencies. For example, LAMP stacks are moving targets, and wise admins keep them updated religiously. But RHEL 6 ships with PHP 5.3.3 and RHEL 7 ships with PHP 5.4, both of which are so old and unsafe they've been deprecated and are unsupported by the PHP team. Red Hat keeps them patched, but most apps and servers require newer PHP versions. Getting newer versions was quite a hassle until Red Hat created the Software Collections, which is both a software repository and a toolset to build your own packages. Not all SCL packages are supported; see Red Hat Software Collections for a supported list. Up Next: Ubuntu Linux See our next installment, in which we explore Canonical's Ubuntu Linux. Ubuntu is the easiest of the enterprise Linuxes to obtain; simply download it without jumping through any hoops. Ubuntu is the youngest major enterprise Linux, and they are making their mark in a number of interesting ways.

If you have never heard of this, the biggest scandal to hit computer gaming, listen in. Over 40% of the populations of most western countries play computer games. If you are a gamer you are very welcome. / Philip Lewis, a member of the 1960s counterculture, whose online name Len Firewood comes from a cartoon character, tells us about GamerGate. Philip/Len is a retired IT consultant, since 1996 has been a below the radar libertarian online activist for various just causes. Q. “What is GamerGate?” “There had been a lot of dissatisfaction about the gaming media within the gaming industry. They called it the ‘Three ‘C’s’: Confusion, Corruption and Cronyism….In August 2014, an Indie game developer, Zoe Quinn, became the subject of a blog post by her ex-boyfriend, and she attracted a lot of attention to herself, with a game, that I wouldn't even describe as being third rate. It was a text adventure thing with a title: ‘Depression Quest’ believe it or not. She had been alleging harassment, which was later disproven, but from this she gained a lot of press attention. Then the blog post came out, which caused a lot more attention… it turned out the Zoe had been exploiting her sexual partners to get her game promoted… That revealed a lot of corruption within the gaming press, and was a forerunner for GamerGate which started in 4chan, which is a Reddit forum. Within this format they amplified and explored stories within the gaming media, and the other tactic which was very effective, was to email advertisers which were advertising within corrupt publications and say: ‘Why are you buying advertising in publications run by people who have disdain for your products?’ Instead of the gaming media being wise and having a grain of humility, and saying, fair enough, we need to clean our act up, they doubled down and went on the attack against gaming, and the gaming culture generally. They represented it as being almost entirely male, and misogynistic, one said that gamers were: ‘basement dwelling trolls….It all got very serious when Intel actually pulled out of, losing Kontaku (of the major game producers) millions of dollars in revenue.  …We know that the mainstream media itself isn’t above corruption, and isn't exactly above shaping narratives according to its own and other people’s interests rather than the consumers’ or the man or women in the street.” “The gaming media did get help from the wider mainstream media, because as this got more publicity, it spilled out into the mass media quite a lot, particularly in America….From my perspective it was a real threat, because what they saw is a group of consumers actually defying the goliath of mainstream, and saying; ‘no we do not accept your narrative,’ and we have discovered that we have a right to reply. The internet has provided a right of reply and we are going to damn well use it.” The significance of GamerGate “This is significant because it is not just limited to gaming, it demonstrates something which I found extremely exciting and interesting, and that was: because it was a leaderless campaign, it was a hashtag, strategies were developed within the Reddit forum, but then they were offered to the general public. Whether or not people adopted it was up to them. Its incredible popularity was based on a consensus of going along with what was developed… I found it fascinating that there was an emergent side to it, of incredible altruism which came from nowhere….It brought all sorts of different groups together. For example, there were hard core men's’ rights activists supporting GamerGate, and hard core radical feminists… that so many different groups could come together to fight for one cause was a very exciting phenomenon.” Is this about the power of the press? “Yes, the gaming press were trying to ‘other’ the gamers, and the main stream media joined in by not critically examining the allegations made against gamers….But the gaming industry was changed by GamerGate, for the better…” We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com ...

That wasn't correct 4Chan is a separate board characterised by anonymity. As such it is quite an anarchic board and "politically incorrect" to say the least. However something very odd happened when #GamerGate became a thing because not long after inception the owners of the online board banned all discussion of #GamerGate - it was at that point that many 4Channers who supported the GamerGate campaign migrated the topic to Reddit where it also caused a lot of controversy. Not surprising given the vested interests at stake. Currently the main forum in Reddit continuing ongoing discussion of the hashtag #GamerGate plus other gaming and free speech issues is in a reddit forum called Kotaku In Action www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction for those curious.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

This article is featured in the new DZone Guide to Integration, Volume III. Get your free copy for more insightful articles, industry statistics, and more. The IT world is moving forward fast. Cloud services, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things peel away existing business models, but also establish wild spaghetti architectures through different departments and lines of business. Several different concepts, technologies, and deployment options are used. A single integration backbone is not sufficient anymore in this era of integration. A Hybrid Integration Platform for Core and Edge Services “Hybrid Integration Platform (HIP)” is a term coined by Gartner and other analysts. It describes different components of a modern integration architecture. Leveraging a well-conceived hybrid integration architecture allows different stakeholders of an enterprise to react quickly to new requirements. Mission-critical core business processes (also called “core services”) are still operated by the central IT department. These services run the business and change rather infrequently. On the other side is the line of business needing to try out new — or adapt existing — business processes quickly in an Agile way without the use of delaying and frustrating rules and processes governed by central IT. Innovation by a “fail fast” strategy and creating so-called “edge services” is getting more and more important to enhance or disrupt existing business models and therefore change the business. Figure 1: Enterprise journey with CORE and EDGE services. The following figure shows the components needed in a Hybrid Integration Platform to run and change the business successfully: Figure 2: Components of a hybrid integration platform. Application Integration With an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) When to Use It ESBs are usually used in bigger IT projects where mission-critical core business processes have to be integrated with a need for high availability, reliability, and performance within the enterprise (“core services”). This affects many different technologies and applications to integrate standard software, legacy systems, custom applications, or external cloud services. Deployment Model and Target Audience Integration specialists implement ESB clusters to leverage high performance, high availability, fault tolerance, and guaranteed delivery of transactions. Most of the integration happens on premise in the private data center. Therefore, even “microservices do not spell the end of the ESB!” You can deploy to cloud, but this is more “cloud-washed” — but not cloud-native — deployment and operations; you “just deploy your existing application to the cloud!” However, this also can make sense, like for test instances or to use IaaS capabilities without leveraging cloud-native features. Some Options An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) includes products such as MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, Talend ESB, WSO2 ESB, TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks, or Oracle Service Bus. An alternative pure-coding solution is using an open-source Integration Framework such as Apache Camel or Spring Integration. Cloud-Native Application Integration When to Use It Integration in a cloud-native environment is quite different than your traditional approach to application integration. Typically, companies leverage platforms-as-a-service (PaaS) such as Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Apache Mesos. The applications created using these cloud-native application integration tools run natively within these PaaS environments and therefore benefit from the features offered by these platforms, including provisioning infrastructure, service discovery, load balancing, elasticity, cluster management, or fail-over out-of-the-box. It also allows more Agile development to implement, adopt, and scale new features or innovations quickly and efficiently. For this, the application development and architecture needs to be adapted to cloud-native concepts. This especially includes applying concepts behind “The Twelve-Factor App” principles, which recommends best practices for cloud- native applications such as stateless services, automation via DevOps, or environment-independent backing services. Often, you leverage independent containers (i.e., Docker, CoreOS, or Cloud Foundry’s Warden) for building cloud-native microservices or applications. Deployment Model and Target Audience Core IT teams are adopting these PaaS platforms, but they are doing this to drive the agility for all developers. As a result, both the traditional integration teams as well as the developers within line of business are able to benefit from these platforms and the capabilities offered by the integration technologies. PaaS are widely adopted: on premise, in the public cloud, or as hybrid deployments. However, many enterprises do not have a complete, long-term strategy yet regarding cloud or hybrid deployment architectures. Hence it is important to develop cloud-platform-agnostic integration services, which can be moved from one platform to another without great effort or redevelopment. Middleware also should support and integrate mature, open-source frameworks for cloud-native environments such as Spring Cloud Configuration, Consul, Netflix’s Eureka, or Hystrix instead of re-inventing the wheel by introducing additional complexity. The article “A Cloud-Native Architecture for Middleware” explains the concepts behind cloud-native platforms and deployment options in much more detail. Some Options TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition or WSO2 are examples for cloud-agnostic integration middleware supporting different PaaS and container platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS ECS. JBoss Middleware Services allows the deployment of its middleware applications onto OpenShift. Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS) When to Use It An iPaaS Cloud Integration middleware is a pure public cloud offering hosted by a speci c vendor. Using iPaaS allows the line of business to react quickly to new requirements or innovative ideas without struggling with the core IT team and its long release and quality management processes. iPaaS can be used for both mission-critical core services and innovative edge services. Deployment Model and Target Audience The vendor takes care of cloud-native features such as provisioning of infrastructure, elasticity, or multi-tenancy. This needs to be a real cloud-native enterprise-grade runtime and not just a “cloud-washed” offering. Otherwise, it is not possible to scale out quickly and easily while still keeping high demands regarding stability and resiliency of integration services. The target audience for iPaaS is not necessarily the integration specialist with extensive technical experience. iPaaS also allows colleagues with less technical expertise (sometimes called “ad hoc integrators”) to define, deploy, and monitor services and APIs with its corresponding policies. Ad hoc integrators often do not use the more powerful IDE but an intuitive and simple-to-use web user interface. iPaaS has to work well together with other integration solutions. How different integration solutions work together depends from vendor to vendor. You should check if you need to redevelop existing services, if you can add changes via a web UI, and if different products work together at all (including commercial support). Some Options The iPaaS market is just emerging these days. Some examples are Dell Boomi, Informatica Cloud, MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, SnapLogic, Jitterbit, or TIBCO Cloud Integration. Integration Software as a Service (iSaaS) When to Use It iSaaS integrations serve “edge services,” which are not strategic and mission-critical for the enterprise — but very relevant for the specific business user. For instance, a business user creates a daily automatic flow to synchronize data from a Google Sheet with Salesforce CRM. This removes the need to integrate these updates manually every day. Deployment Model and Target Audience iSaaS is hosted and operated by the vendor. In contrast to the above integration components, iSaaS focuses on business users (also called citizen integrator in this context). They can create basic integration flows for personal or department interests in a very intuitive web user interface without any technical knowledge. Some Options Examples for iSaaS solutions are SnapLogic, TIBCO Simplr, or IFTTT (“If This Then That”). IoT Integration Gateway When to Use It The Internet of Things (IoT) changes the role of edge integration. It raises several new challenges not relevant for classical application integration such as low bandwidth or non-reliable connectivity. Here you need to integrate data directly on the edge devices, as not all data should be sent to the private data center or public cloud. For example, you might aggregate and filter sensor data from an assembly line in manufacturing, and only forward relevant information (such as alerts) to external interfaces. An IoT Integration Gateway interconnects all devices via various IoT Standards such as MQTT, CoAP, WebSockets, Bluetooth or RFID. Deployment Model and Target Audience Integration specialists use the IoT Integration Gateway to realize IoT edge integration. Development can be done via coding or intuitive web user interface and out-of-the-box connectivity to various IoT standards. Some Options You can use hardware gateways from vendors such as Intel, ARM, or Eurotech, or IoT gateway open-source frameworks such as IBM’s NodeRED (implemented with Node.js using JavaScript) or TIBCO’s Flogo (implemented with Google’s Go Programming Language). API Management When to Use It The trend is heading towards an Open API Economy where services are exposed as APIs to other internal departments, partners, or public developers. Think about examples such as PayPal, whose API is integrated into almost every online shop as a payment option, or Google Maps, whose API is used in almost every website that includes a description of how to get somewhere. Deployment Model and Target Audience The target audience is the line of business which leverages API Portals to think about new digital products to increase revenue or make customers happy. A key for success in a hybrid integration architecture is a good cooperation between API Management and different integration solutions. This enables developers to reuse services to concentrate on new features, shorter time-to-market, and innovation instead of recreating existing services again. Some Options Examples of API Management solutions are Apigee (Pure Player), Akana (Pure Player, formerly SOA Software), Mashery (TIBCO), or 3scale (Red Hat). Sometimes a hardware API Gateway such as IBM DataPower Gateway is used as a replacement for or in addition to the software API Gateway. The Need for a Hybrid Integration Architecture This survey shows that a single integration platform is not sufficient anymore in the era of cloud, mobile, big data, and IoT. Differentiation between core services for running the business and edge services for changing the business is a key step towards a Hybrid Integration Platform. On-premise vs. cloud-native development and deployment is another key aspect. Streaming Analytics and Business Process Management (out of the scope of this article) are not part of application integration directly, but also relevant for a hybrid integration architecture.

The company, who makes a variety of Thunderbolt 3 peripherals, discovered that their devices will not work with the new MacBook because they use a first generation controller chip from Texas Instruments. Apple has chosen to prevent Thunderbolt 3 devices using currently available controller chips from Texas Instruments from enumerating and functioning on the 2016 MacBook Pros. All current Thunderbolt 3 peripherals which use this controller chip are incompatible with the new 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks (To our knowledge, this includes all currently available Thunderbolt 3 devices including our TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X graphics adapters. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible.) Because of this, we've made the difficult decision to postpone our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station as we evaluate what is necessary to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging is using the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. Plugable expands on its findings in a statement provided to MacRumors... The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Certified Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters (released prior to November 2016). These existing devices use Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge) in combination with the first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected and are disabled by OS X on the new MacBooks. So we offer these products as Windows-only Thunderbolt 3 devices until a future hardware update. Our Thunderbolt 3 cables do not require this chip, and therefore are compatible. We’ve also made the difficult decision to postpone our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. Apple issued the following statement on the matter to AppleInsider: "While we have no comment on Plugable's specific complaint, products using the newest Thunderbolt chipsets, with up-to-date drivers, will have no difficulty connecting to any 2016 MacBook Pro" The revelation is bound to cause further upset among pro users. Many feel as though the company's laptop is no longer 'pro'. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Does it have the peripherals you need to charge your iPhone 7? NO. Does it have the peripherals you need to use the most commonly used technologies today? NO. Is it a powerhouse like the MacBooks produces under the helm of Steve Jobs? NO. Is it worth the price tag when you can get a Windows computer, hackintosh it, and have not only a more powerful computer, but one with all the peripherals you need already integrated? NO. I hate to say it, but Apple has become pure garbage. Thanks for ruining a beautiful thing, Tim Cook.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Going by the latest reports it seems that the Apple MacBook Air will be released in 2017 and the device is still a hot favourite among tech enthusiasts. The MacBook Air 2017 was not announced during the recent Apple event on Oct. 27. Instead, the Cupertino company compared the device to the MacBook Pro 2016. This led many to believe that Apple may have finally killed off its Air line-up. The 11-inch MacBook Air has already been killed off and it seems that the 13-inch model is also on the chopping block. Prices for the older MacBook Airs have been slashed. According to Macworld, the 13-inch MacBook Air can still be upgraded. Now a user can get 512GB of storage for just $200. Air enthusiasts believe that in case Apple does not release a MacBook Air in 2017, it will at least stick to its yearly upgrade cycle. However, if Apple does release the MacBook Air, it will do so anytime between March and May like before. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 (if released) will sport some amazing features and specs. A 15-inch screen and Retina Display are expected. The highly-anticipated MacBook Air 2017 may be released in 11-inch, 13-inch and 15-inch variants and they are expected to be thinner and lighter than their predecessors. Information on the processor and battery capacity is not available though rumours suggest that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 will sport Intel’s highly-advanced Kaby Lake processor. Fans expect the Apple Pencil to be included with the MacBook Air 2017 and the stylus could be used in different modes such as the rotational controller mode and the joystick mode. Force Touch upgrade is also expected along with the Touch ID feature. Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C ports may be incorporated for super-fast charging and data transfer. Tech enthusiasts speculate the price of the Apple MacBook Air 2017 to be around US$1,200 (AU$1,560). However, MacRumors believes that Apple will phase out the MacBook Air line replacing it with MacBook and MacBook Pro.

The lineup’s pricing and underwhelming changes left us unimpressed. But if you absolutely must have a new MacBook Pro, you might want to wait until the second half of 2017. According to Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at Taiwan-based KGI Securities and kinda-sorta like the evleaks of all things Apple, the company’s laptops tend to drop in price shortly after a new generation is launched; he notes that by the second half of 2017, the latest MacBook Pros should be a bit more affordable.

Find out more Kuo also notes that there’s also a chance that the lineup will eventually support 32GB RAM by then, but this will depend on whether Intel releases its Cannonlake processors in time for that mid-2017 refresh. those chips are designed to consume less power and thus allow the system to transmit that juice to additional RAM. It’ll be interesting to see if those changes actually happen, and if they are enough to drum up interest in Apple’s new laptops.

[Photos: Flickr users Stacie DaPonte, spencer cooper, Fibonacci Blue, Wikipedia, CafeCredit.com] Jared Lindzon 11.01.16 5:00 AM Though 2016 may have felt like a tumultuous year, a variety of factors are poised to ripple through 2017, further disrupting business as usual. That's according to Brian Kropp, the human resources practice leader for CEB. The best practice insight and technology company that works with 20,000 senior leaders at 10,000 organizations worldwide gathered and analyzed internal and external data to look at broader trends that will influence the way we work next year. Kropp says major changes in public policy, technology, and employee demands will shape the challenges faced by business leaders and employees in the year to come. Among the key factors driving this change is one that stems from the 2008 financial crisis. Throughout the recovery period organizations of all shapes and sizes have had to learn how to do more with less, and are now unable to get much leaner. "They're in a situation now where they're seeing limited top-line growth, it's hard to pull more costs out of the system, but at the same time Wall Street and public markets are really expecting companies to continue to grow," says Kropp. He says that the only way for most companies to continue growing is through significant changes in how they operate. Overall he says, "That's the business environment and the business challenge companies are facing as we look into 2017." Within that new business environment Kropp identifies five ways work will change in 2017. Private Companies Will Dictate Social Policy Whether Americans elect Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton as their next president, supporters on both sides believe that Washington will continue to be dysfunctional in the coming year. As a result, Kropp believes that private companies will step in and set the agenda for decisions and policies that are typically left to the political class. For example, while the debate over $15 minimum wage rages on, individual companies have taken measures into their own hands, and are now implementing it themselves. As a result, Kropp suggests other companies will be forced to follow suit in order to remain competitive. "What's likely to happen in 2017, as more and more companies go down that path of setting what that standard is, it will set a de facto social policy," he said. Kropp points to other examples, such as North Carolina’s controversial HB2 "bathroom bill." It was met with pressure from private companies who threatened to take business out of the state. Likewise, many employers, such as Netflix, Ernst and Young and Coca Cola implemented their own paid parental leave policies ahead of federal or state mandated changes. "That will have a bigger impact on social policy than what government can accomplish in a dysfunctional Washington," says Kropp. Automation Will Cause Job Losses Well Beyond The Factory Floor Though automation has been blamed for eliminating large numbers of blue-collar jobs, particularly in manufacturing, Kropp believes that in 2017 robots are coming for jobs once considered irreplaceable by machines, and at a much quicker pace. Kropp points to wearable technologies such as heads up displays that are now being used by medical professionals as an example. If technology can provide information and guide surgeons through a procedure, they don’t need as many nurses, he says. As another example, Kropp cites paralegals who spend much of their time sifting through cases and decisions to help lawyers position arguments and courtroom strategies. "With artificial intelligence scraping across all that information, they will have algorithms that start to predict what sort of argument would be most effective with this judge," says Kropp, "When that happens, you don't need paralegals anymore." Private Companies Will Be Forced To Address Internal Drug Policies Nine states will include recreational marijuana legislation on the ballot in November, but there’s really only one that Kropp says could change the game for many American employers, should the referendum pass. "If California votes in favor of that, so many organizations have employees in California, or have an office in California," he points out. "It's going to shift from a few states being outliers to many more states, including the biggest state in the union, having legal marijuana, which forces it to be an issue for all organizations." Aside from implementing marijuana-related workforce policies, Kropp says organizations will also be forced to grapple with policies surrounding other substances, including pharmaceutical drugs, such as those intended for ADD and ADHD treatment. "If there's more legitimate use for pharmaceutical drugs, is it okay for a job candidate to be using that during an assessment test or not? Is that fair or unfair?" asks Kropp, adding that most organizations aren’t prepared to provide an answer. CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure Laws Will Have Unintended Consequences On the first day of 2017 the SEC’s Pay Ratio Disclosure rules will go into effect, but they will reveal much more than the wage of the organization’s top earner. Kropp suggests that there will be little surprise in that regard, but there will be one major unintended consequence. The new rules stipulate that public companies need to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to median employee salaries, which will reveal to many employees where they stack up in terms of compensation. "As soon as that number comes out, 50% of your employees will now find out they are underpaid relative to the average, and that will have a huge impact on employee engagement, retention, motivation, the cost structure of the organization, and that is the much bigger issue," says Kropp. A recent study by PayScale suggests that those who are aware of their CEO’s compensation have little problem with it, but that a majority of those in the know receive above average compensation themselves. "Many employees will find out that they are paid on the bottom half of their company, when their manager has told them they're well compensated," he adds. Diversity Policies Will Address A Widely Ignored Minority Group Diversity initiatives announced in the last 12 months alone by organizations such as Intel and Slack are tackling some major imbalances within the American workforce. Yet while these tend to focus on women and underrepresented ethnic groups, Kropp says, "People and organizations are going to start to realize there's an entire segment of the workforce that is being ignored in most of those initiatives, and those are people with intellectual disabilities." While not all companies will develop policies and practices aimed at those with intellectual disabilities, some of the more progressive organizations will seek to include this group in its diversity hiring in 2017, putting pressure on their competitors to do the same.

SentinelOne was also approved as a next-generation security solution and added as a member to the Anti-Malware Standards Testing Organization (AMSTO). The independent test is the first of its kind, focusing on specific criteria tied to next-generation capabilities. "SentinelOne performed in the top tier among the next-generation endpoint protection vendors in anti-malware testing," said Andreas Clementi, CEO and founder of AV-Comparatives. "We view this as a positive direction for the industry, as these technologies that utilize advanced behavior techniques and machine learning show good prevention and detection capabilities." "Next-generation" has been a vague term, especially in security. For endpoint protection, it signifies that a solution works on a different principle than traditional antivirus software but what this exactly entails still remains nebulous. Despite how unclear it is whether "next-gen" vendors can truly do a better job than their predecessors, testing criteria have barely changed. Tests have historically focused on file-based (PEs and DLLs) malware while excluding fileless malware and scripts -- which are increasing in prevalence today. Fortunately, that's finally beginning to change as third-parties like MRG Effitas, AV-Comparatives and NSS Labs evolve their testing methods to account for the new realities of the threat landscape. The review format included assessments of the management console, layout, deployment, monitoring, response, updates and more. For malware protection, the test focused on four areas: RTTL: Response to the most prevalent malicious samples according to the AMTSO Real-Time Threat List AVC: Response to most recent and prevalent malicious samples in the AVC database WPDT: Performance on the top malicious websites compared to traditional business AV technology running in tandem FPs: Ability to parse through false positives Among the endpoint security products tested, SentinelOne performed top of class achieving 100% prevention across RTTL, AVC and WPDT. The company accomplished this with zero false positives. "This is a testament to the hard work we've put into the SentinelOne platform since we embarked on our mission to change the way businesses protect themselves from the latest advanced attacks," said Tomer Weingarten, CEO of SentinelOne. "For too long, companies have touted machine learning capabilities, automation and more, but what we are finding out is that is primarily marketing jargon with little to no real benefit to customers. As an industry, we need to provide updated, third-party validated, benchmarks so that customers can make informed decisions against the realities of today's threat landscape." The test also found that SentinelOne's platform is intuitive and simple to use -- including analysis capabilities that allow administrators to clearly identify each event in an attack. Additionally, it enables group-based policies that trigger automated responses, from alert to kill in real-time. To download the full report click here or visit the SentinelOne blog for more details.
