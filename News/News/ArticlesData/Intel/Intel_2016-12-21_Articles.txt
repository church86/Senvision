(Duncan Alfreds, Fin24) RELATED ARTICLES Apple's Mac no longer bucking PC industry's sales slide WhatsApp launches Windows, Mac desktop app WATCH: Apple showcases its latest upgrades San Francisco - To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. READ: What to expect as Apple gets ready for Mac update They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10% of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad.   People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.   An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets.  Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We’re really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." READ: Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in major refresh Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.  In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.  In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.  That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn’t look good on such a large product.  In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said.  When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. READ: Apple to end Mac update drought with October event For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.  In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though.  The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US.  Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News.  The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

The Apple MacBook Air also comes with an array of other smart and efficient features, making it a great companion for your digital life on the go. Fifth-Generation Intel Core Processor – Performance, Meet Endurance MacBook Air is powered by fifth-generation Intel Core i5 processor. This ultra-efficient architecture was designed to use less power and still deliver high performance. Which means not only can you do whatever you want — you can keep doing it for longer than before. In addition, the Intel HD Graphics 6000 processor offers advanced performance you’ll especially notice with games and other graphics-intensive tasks. 802.11ac Wi-Fi - The De?nition of Fast MacBook Air supports ultrafast 802.11ac Wi-Fi. When connected to an 802.11ac base station — including AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule — wireless performance is up to 3x faster than 802.11n Wi-Fi. And your Wi-Fi range improves as well. With Bluetooth technology, you can connect MacBook Air to Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones. Even without all the wires, you’re totally connected. Fast All-Flash Storage – Ready. Set. Done Part of what makes MacBook Air so responsive is that it’s designed entirely around flash storage. Not only does this make MacBook Air much lighter and more portable than traditional notebooks, it also provides faster access to data. This PCIe-based flash storage is up to 17x faster than a traditional 5400-rpm notebook hard drive. So when you flip open MacBook Air, it’s ready to go right away. Even after a month in standby mode, the screen springs to life. Thunderbolt 2 and USB 3 - Make Some Powerful Connections With a Thunderbolt 2 port that’s twice as fast as the previous generation, you can connect your MacBook Air to the latest devices and displays, like the Apple Thunderbolt Display. But that’s not the whole story. MacBook Air also comes equipped with two USB 3 ports, so you can connect the latest USB 3 devices and all your USB 2 devices as well. With just a few connections, MacBook Air transforms from an ultraportable notebook to a complete workstation. Display, Camera, and Mics - Impressive. In Every Sense Led-Backlit Display. Millions of Pixels. Millimeters Thin - Corner to corner and pixel by pixel, the MacBook Air display is both an engineering feat and a design breakthrough. The display measures a mere 4.86 millimeters (0.19 inch) thin, yet its resolution makes you feel like you’re looking at a larger screen. The 11-inch MacBook Air features a resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels, while the 13-inch model wows with a resolution of 1440 by 900 pixels. And LED backlighting makes colors bright and vibrant from edge to edge. So whether you’re editing photos, perfecting a presentation, or watching a movie, you’re going to love what you see. 720p FaceTime Hd Camera. Stay Sharp - Let your friends and family see more of you with the 720p FaceTime HD camera. Every smile looks bright, even halfway around the world. And the widescreen format means everyone can fit into the picture without having to crowd around the display. Dual Mics. They’ll Hear You Loud and Clear - The dual microphones in MacBook Air are great for when you want to be heard. If you’re making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice — instead of the noise around you. Multi-Touch Trackpad - It Goes Hand in Hand with macOS The Multi-Touch gestures in macOS make everything you do on MacBook Air more intuitive, direct, and fun. And the spacious Multi-Touch trackpad is perfectly designed for them, whether it’s a three-finger swipe to activate Mission Control or a four-finger pinch to see all your apps in Launchpad. Gesture responses are smooth and realistic. So when you’re scrolling up and down a web page or swiping from one full-screen app to another, it’s almost like you’re touching what you’re seeing. Click Press down anywhere to click. Or, with Tap to Click enabled, tap the trackpad. Double-Click Press down two times anywhere. Or, with Tap to Click enabled, double-tap the trackpad. Tap to Zoom Double-tap the trackpad with two fingers to magnify a web page or PDF. Two-Finger Scroll Slide two fingers up or down the trackpad to scroll through documents, websites, and more. Swipe to Navigate Flip through web pages, documents, and more like thumbing pages in a book. View Mission Control Swipe up on the trackpad to get a bird’s-eye view of everything running on your Mac. Backlit Keyboard - What You See Is What You Type As incredibly compact as MacBook Air is, it still manages to fit a full-size keyboard that makes typing as natural as it is comfortable. And the keyboard is backlit, so you can type with ease in even the dimmest light. A built-in ambient light sensor detects changes in lighting conditions and adjusts the display and keyboard brightness automatically. From a seat in a sunny café to a seat on a cross-country red-eye, you’ll always have the perfect lighting for any environment.

The 10Gbit/second Ethernet market will peak in 2017 and start to decline in 2018, pushed aside by 25, 50, and 100GbE. Just a few short years after becoming the largest Ethernet speed segment, 10GbE sales will peak in 2017 and start a steady decline. Hyperscale giants have already moved to 40, 50, and even 100Gbits/s. More importantly, 25Gbit/s Ethernet is available now from all of the major server vendors – and 25 is the new 10. With 2.5x the throughput and only a modest price premium over 10Gbit/s, it will be a no-brainer for IT decision makers to choose 25GbE networks. There are multiple drivers for 25GbE: faster storage, big data, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. Faster storage needs faster networks. In the never ending game of leap frog between compute, storage, and I/O it is clear that networking has become the bottleneck and this will accelerate the drive to 25GbE. Open Ethernet platforms will take off. Open Ethernet networking platforms will make a noticeable impact in 2017. The availability of full featured, high performance and cost effective open switching platforms combined with open network operating systems such as Cumulus Networks, Microsoft SoNIC, and OpenSwitch will finally see significant volume uptake in 2017. The flexibility, transparency, and efficiency of open platforms pose a real challenge to the incumbent black-box providers whose systems combine proprietary hardware with closed software. The ability of open platforms to decouple the hardware and software and offer customers the choice of multiple hardware platforms and multiple network operating systems will result in significant deployments that will make the big boys take notice. The first signs of the decline and fall of the 20+ year x86 hegemony will appear in 2017. Last but not least, in 2017 the first cracks will start to appear in Intel’s vaunted CPU dominance. The threat of the Vandals and Visigoths wasn’t recognized back in Rome when news that groups of marauders first crossed the provincial borders. So too some apparently insignificant entrants into the CPU space could turn out to be real challengers to Intel. Key to Intel’s market domination has been its ability to maintain process technology leadership. Understanding the value of Moore’s law and staying one generation ahead of everyone else can cover a myriad of architecture, power and system-level shortcomings. But now for the first time the driver of process technology is not server CPUs, but rather system-on-chip devices destined for mobile devices where other players lead. According to SemiWiki this means that for the first time ever a pure-play foundry, TSMC, will have the process lead over Intel. The availability of industry leading fab processes will allow other processor architectures (including AMD x86, ARM, Open Power and even the new RISC-V architecture) to compete with Intel on a level playing field. But rest assured that Intel won’t simply let other CPU architectures waltz in and steal market share without a fight. Intel is a formidable competitor with significant resources and technical expertise and has proven itself capable to take on all challengers many times in the past. So it will be interesting to watch if we are on the cusp of a dramatic shakeup in the chip world. We will start to see the beginnings of this in 2017. With significant technology transitions like this normally there are disruptions among both vendors and service providers who make the right technology choices at the right time and wind up with significant efficiency advantages over their competitors. As new compute, storage and networking technologies roll out in 2017 it will be interesting to see who the winners and the losers will be. --Kevin Deierling (@TechseerKD) has served as Mellanox's VP of marketing since March 2013.

There are probably billions of lines of code written for x86 for the data center. This is all running nicely on the Intel CPUs. Software and CPU architecture are huge. It's not just a process node issue on what wins and gets used. It's a similar issue with software stacks for networking. The Broadcom software stack is extensive and completely debugged and working. Millions of lines of code running BGP under all complex scenarios. Networking is about the software too. All the L2 L3 switching and routing protocols. Even though everyone lies about the process nodes. I think the industry clearly recognizes that Intel still has the lead in process technology. The TSMC 16 FF is closer to a real 20 nm solution. Intel won't even hire you for a process R&D job unless you have a Ph.D. I think they have and will continue to have the clear lead in process technology. You really think they will let TSMC beat them in process R&D? I think they have a little pride over there. It's quite interesting to note that Mellanox themselves use Intel x86 CPUs to drive the Spectrum 32 port Ethernet boxes. Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and move away from Intel x86 CPUs to power your Ethernet switch products?   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie Re: My prediction emesdoublee   12/29/2016 3:45:24 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I'm not sure the purpose of your post. You are in charge of marketing at mellanox so I assume there is some mellanox angle to it. What is your market share in Ethernet switching? Is it even 0.1 % of shipping 25g ports? I dare you to tell the truth about that here. The board of directorsof mellanox should hold Eyal accountable for this failed effort to get into Ethernet switching and compete with Broadcom. He has spent several years and millions of dollars to try this and made zero progress. You make some loud claims about how superior your solution is but it never translates to any sales. I think Cavium xpliant has better luck than you with a big win at Arista.. Eyal has done one of the dumbest and most arrogant things ever to sabotage his own success. He makes, markets, and sells the complete switch product. Who in their right mind would want to use a switch silicon from someone who also makes the full box to compete against you? In any case, it's getting harder, not easier to take on incumbents. The cost of 10 and then 7 nm products will reduce number of players that can even afford a tapeout. I think semi industry is consolidating rapidly to just a few viable players who can succeed and make money. Intel for data center CPUs and Broadcom for Ethernet switching silicon. Niether one are standing still. Tomahawk II has 64 ports of 100g switching muscle. That is huge.

Indeed I'm not sure who will be the leader in the next generation process nodes and cited the SemiWiki's opinion here. What I am sure of is that Moore's Law is stretching out ... BK even confirmed this in an earnings call a few quarters back. So now you are seeing the tick-tock-tick model moving to a tick-tock-tock-tick model ... So as the periods between Moore generations stetches out it will narrow the gap. So no matter who is first to a new process node,  there will be a fast follower!

But your predictions are certainly at odds with how I believe things will play out. As I said predictions are dangerous things as they make you accountable. It will be interesting to look at how reality plays out in 2017. It is always easies/safest to predict that the dominant players will remain dominant. But I remember in the 2000 time frame thinking that the Microsoft operating system, browser, and office suite were so dominant in the enterprise that there was nothing that would derail them in my lifetime. But I certaintly didn't see the DotCom crash coming, the rise of Google, and then Apple, and Facebook, and the Amazon Cloud, the decline of the PC and rise of the mobile platform, and finally the re-incarnation of Microsoft's growth as a Cloud company. So I've become a bit more humble about my ability as a TechSeer than I was in my youth. There are things just beyond the horizon that I can't envision. The only thing I'm very confident of is that the status quo won't remain, and there will be dramatic changes in the future. If only I had your confidence and knew the future as precisely as you appear to!

Mellanox will continue to go completely unused as an Ethernet switch vendor. Broadcom Tomahawk II will continue with the complete dominance in Ethernet swtiching. I'm sure there is a 56G PAM4 switch coming soon. Nobody wants to compete against their switch chip vendor for the box sale too. I thought this Open Ethernet had died. The truth is that Broadcom provides full robust software stack for these "open" switches. Intel will increase the dominance in the data center, not reduce. Intel has over 95% market share in data center processor. That's not because of process technology alone. A huge part of that is simply x86 software stability and robustness. The data center can't crash hourly. Open Power, really? I'll believe it when I see it. Power9 is probably going to be the last Power processor ever by IBM. The CEO of IBM wants to get rid of all hardware. That team has to be max expensive. Nobody used Power8 and nobody will use Power9. It costs quite a bit to fund a processor team for a processor that nobody uses. ARM? I think we just saw how much traction that is getting. Paramesh Gopi is looking for a new job because of his big bet on ARM servers. And lastly, Mellanox will get bought. They are a little guy and little guys are getting gobbled up daily. That market cap of 2B puts the MLNX right in the cross hairs of a major Tier 1 Semi company.

Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. (Also see:  CEO Tim Cook Says 'Great Desktops' Are Coming From Apple)Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. (Also see:  Some MacBook Pro 2016 Users Are Reporting Battery Life Issues) In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. (Also see:  MacBook Pro 2016 With Touch Bar Gets Lowest Possible Repairability Score) In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. © 2016 Bloomberg L.P.

The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017, though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.

Support for Ubuntu 16.04 desktop OS has been added to the Joule board, according to developer notes for Intel IoT Developer Kit 5.0 released late last week. Intel has two Joule boards: the 570x, which sells for $219 on Mouser, and the 550x, which is priced at $179 on the same retail site. The 550x, which started shipping recently, was priced at $349 until Monday, but was cut in half after a story by the IDG News Service pointed out the unusually high price. The Joule boards are like Raspberry Pi 3, with all major components crammed on a circuit board. But Joule is tricked out with recently released components, memory and storage, making it the fastest board computer in its class. The Joule boards have the latest Atom processors based on the Broxton architecture, GPUs capable of 4K video capture, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, LPDDR4 memory, USB 3.0 ports and internal storage up to 8GB. Raspberry Pi 3 has an ARM processor, no internal storage, USB 2.0, 1080p graphics processor and slower memory and Wi-Fi.

This year it is thanks to ten year old Aoife Fitzpatrick from 4th class, who has proven that colours can help with memorising. First winning the school's own Science Fair, judged by Intel rep Ann Tilson, Aoife and her school and family then attended the regional finals at Intel in Leixlip on December 8, where she was selected for the Intel Mini Scientist All Ireland Final, and won a crystal trophy and gold medal. The final is on February 3 at Dublin City University, and Aoife will be one of 21 finalists, representing Laois. Her project “Can canny colour make memory meliorate?” proves that changing the colour of text and background colour can significantly improve memorisation and retention of facts. Aoife has big shoes to fill, as the school has won the overall prize for two years. The achievement was honoured last May when they were all invited to the Aras to spend the afternoon with President Michael D Higgins. Principal Ann Bergin reveals their secret to success. “The ingredients are attention to content analysis, listening to our students, working scientifically and phenomenal dedication, found in abundance in our school community. “I am very proud but even more thrilled for Aoife and her family as all our Intel Mini-Scientists begin at kitchen tables or on sitting-room floors, a wonderful combination of family and school in achievement, real education,” she said. Aoife recalls the moment her name was announced. “It felt absolutely fantastic to win a place in the final. My legs went like jelly. I never thought I’d get as far as Róisín and Jamie did two years ago, and Sinéad and Laura last year. I felt like a celebrity in school after the regional final. Ms Bergin announced it on the microphone. I even got to do a lap of honour around the school. Some friends in fourth class made cards for me and we had a party to celebrate in class,” she said. The project was hard work but interesting she said. “The highlight was teaching my class about the brain and memory,” she said, thanking 3rd to 6th classes who proved her theory by learning their spellings best with a yellow print on a red background. “It would be amazing to bring home a third win for my school,” she said.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Erone Fitzpatrick in action for Scoil Chríost Rí.

Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky—opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad.   People now have more options. Microsoft Corp., once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.   An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets.  Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We’re really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips—a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.  In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.  In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.  That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn’t look good on such a large product.  In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said.  When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.  In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though.  The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products.

Here's why they are paving the way for others. By Alison DeNisco | December 21, 2016, 6:38 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/g-stockstudio Despite criticism over lack of gender diversity and family-friendly policies, the tech industry is far exceeding others in one area of family planning: Fertility treatments. Technology companies offer in vitro fertilization (IVF) benefits nearly 35% higher than their peers, according to a recent report from FertilityIQ, a website aimed at assessing fertility doctors and clinics. And, six of the top 10 employers with the most generous benefits listed fell into the technology category, according to patient data. The rankings considered the amount of money an employer provides for treatments and medications, exclusions, and clinic restrictions. The top 10 best corporate fertility packages are as follows: 1. Spotify 2. Bank of America 3. BCG 4. Intel 5. Facebook 6. Chanel 7. Conair 8. Wayfair 9. Apple 10. Google IVF treatments cost about $23,000 per cycle, according to Jake Anderson-Bialis, co-founder of FertilityIQ. Most patients are not successful on their first try, and require two or three cycles before getting pregnant or giving up, he said. Egg freezing procedures cost about $17,000, according to FertilityIQ data. More for CXOs Quiz: Can you name these 20 tech billionaires? Silicon Valley CTO explains why Trump happened CIO Jury: Two-thirds of IT departments say they won't support 2016 MacBook Pro Subscribe to TechRepublic's Executive Briefing newsletter "Who you work for really determines whether you get this paid for or not," Anderson-Bialis said. "Tech companies dramatically outperformed their peers when it comes to the generosity and broadmindedness of the benefits. It's interesting because we're accustomed to hearing about how tech companies make life difficult for family-focused employees and female employees." Why is tech so generous when it comes to fertility benefits? The main reason is likely the current talent war for engineers and other skilled IT professionals, Anderson-Bialis said. "Anything that ingratiates a potential employee or their spouse to take a job or stay in a job, companies are desperate to do," he said. Another reason? The age of the employee base. "Tech companies are growing up before our eyes," Anderson-Bialis said. "We're seeing these CEOs and employees come of age and go through these struggles." For example, Mark Zuckerberg is now in his thirties, and has publicly discussed how he and his wife suffered three miscarriages before having their daughter. Technology companies are also the most inclusive in their IVF offerings, allowing employees to pursue various types of treatments with no restrictions based on their situation (such as gay couples pursuing surrogacy, or single mothers undergoing artificial insemination). Intel, Facebook, Apple, and Google are the best examples of this inclusion, the report stated. Employers interested in offering these benefits should know there is a return on employee satisfaction, FertilityIQ found: Fertility patients reported feeling a higher degree of loyalty to their employer and stay in their jobs longer when their employer pays for their fertility treatments, the report found. This year, Intel quadrupled fertility benefit coverage to $40,000 for medical services and $20,000 for prescription expenses. The company also removed the previous medical diagnosis requirement for fertility benefits, making conception services available to all employees, including same-sex couples. The expanded services include cryopreservation, and storage of egg, embryo, sperm, and cord blood. "We expanded our fertility benefits in hopes of reducing the financial burden that comes with fertility procedures," said Danielle Brown, chief diversity and inclusion officer and vice president of human resources at Intel Corporation. "Knowing that the average IVF cycle costs nearly $20,000, and the likelihood of success for each cycle is around 20% to 30%, offering increased fertility benefits will help more families complete two full cycles of IVF or cryopreservation." Intel also offers a flexible workplace, adoption benefit coverage, and childcare centers, Brown said. Potential risks In 2014, Facebook and Apple made waves as they became the first tech giants to offer egg freezing for female employees. But women working in tech should not rush into egg freezing or IVF options without thorough research, said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society. "The tech industry has come under a lot of criticism for lack of diversity, including gender diversity, and they perceive this as a way to attract women," Darnovsky said. "The tech industry is also infamous for encouraging employees to work long hours, so this is a way to evade responsibility by encouraging women to put off having families until they're older, so they can lean in now." IVF failure rates are 75% across the board, varying by age, Darnovsky said. And since the American Society for Reproductive Medicine only lifted the experimental label on egg freezing in 2012, there remains little research on long-term health risks. Instead of offering fertility benefits like egg freezing, tech companies should look to adopt more family-friendly workplace policies for all employees, Darnovsky said. "It's a question of workplace culture," she said. "You have to give women and men more time off when they are birthing or adopting children, and create a culture in which both men and women take time off to care for infants. Those things are going to make it possible for women and men to be good parents and to do well at their jobs." "That's what's needed, not something that's a high tech procedure being presented as a silver bullet," Darnovsky added. For men and women in tech who do plan to take advantage of IVF and other fertility benefits, Anderson-Bialis cautions them to prepare for the process. "Working in the tech industry is a demanding field, and going through fertility treatment is a demanding process," he said. "Be realistic about how much time you'll need to go through this process, and the emotional setbacks." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Technology companies outperform their peers when it comes to fertility treatment coverage, and offer in vitro fertilization (IVF) benefits nearly 35% higher than their peers, according to a recent report from FertilityIQ. Spotify, Intel, Facebook, Wayfair, Apple, and Google made the list of top 10 employer fertility packages. While these benefits are likely meant to attract and retain tech talent, especially women, tech workers should be cautious and research the procedures before taking advantage of them, experts said.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel ships Joule 550x computer, but initial units overpriced Intel's Joule board to support Windows 10 IoT Core The Orange Pi Zero single-board computer ships for $6.99 Video Smart Cities: Barcelona If you want a PC with Ubuntu Linux, you can turn to Intel's Joule single-board computer instead of buying an expensive machine. Support for Ubuntu 16.04 desktop OS has been added to the Joule board, according to developer notes for Intel IoT Developer Kit 5.0 released late last week. Intel has two Joule boards: the 570x, which sells for $219 on Mouser, and the 550x, which is priced at $179 on the same retail site. The 550x, which started shipping recently, was priced at $349 until Monday, but was cut in half after a story by the IDG News Service pointed out the unusually high price. The Joule boards are like Raspberry Pi 3, with all major components crammed on a circuit board. But Joule is tricked out with recently released components, memory and storage, making it the fastest board computer in its class. The Joule boards have the latest Atom processors based on the Broxton architecture, GPUs capable of 4K video capture, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, LPDDR4 memory, USB 3.0 ports and internal storage up to 8GB. Raspberry Pi 3 has an ARM processor, no internal storage, USB 2.0, 1080p graphics processor and slower memory and Wi-Fi. Intel designed the Joule board for the development of robots, drones and smart devices requiring heavy processing power. But like Raspberry Pi 3, which is also being used as a PC, the Joule is powerful enough to be a low-end PC or server.

Sometimes the solution to a problem is staring you in the face all along. Chip maker Intel is betting that will be true in the race to build quantum computers—machines that should offer immense processing power by exploiting the oddities of quantum mechanics. Competitors IBM, Microsoft, and Google are all developing quantum components that are different from the ones crunching data in today’s computers. But Intel is trying to adapt the workhorse of existing computers, the silicon transistor, for the task. Intel has a team of quantum hardware engineers in Portland, Oregon, who collaborate with researchers in the Netherlands, at TU Delft’s QuTech quantum research institute, under a $50 million grant established last year. Earlier this month Intel’s group reported that they can now layer the ultra-pure silicon needed for a quantum computer onto the standard wafers used in chip factories. This strategy makes Intel an outlier among industry and academic groups working on qubits, as the basic components needed for quantum computers are known. Other companies can run code on prototype chips with several qubits made from superconducting circuits (see “Google’s Quantum Dream Machine”). No one has yet advanced silicon qubits that far. A quantum computer would need to have thousands or millions of qubits to be broadly useful, though. And Jim Clarke, who leads Intel’s project as director of quantum hardware, argues that silicon qubits are more likely to get to that point (although Intel is also doing some research on superconducting qubits). One thing in silicon’s favor, he says: the expertise and equipment used to make conventional chips with billions of identical transistors should allow work on perfecting and scaling up silicon qubits to progress quickly. Intel’s silicon qubits represent data in a quantum property called the “spin” of a single electron trapped inside a modified version of the transistors in its existing commercial chips. “The hope is that if we make the best transistors, then with a few material and design changes we can make the best qubits,” says Clarke. Another reason to work on silicon qubits is that they should be more reliable than the superconducting equivalents. Still, all qubits are error prone because they work on data using very weak quantum effects (see “Google Researchers Make Quantum Components More Reliable”). The new process that helps Intel experiment with silicon qubits on standard chip wafers, developed with the materials companies Urenco and Air Liquide, should help speed up its research, says Andrew Dzurak, who works on silicon qubits at the University of New South Wales in Australia. “To get to hundreds of thousands of qubits, we will need incredible engineering reliability, and that is the hallmark of the semiconductor industry,” he says. Companies developing superconducting qubits also make them using existing chip fabrication methods. But the resulting devices are larger than transistors, and there is no template for how to manufacture and package them up in large numbers, says Dzurak. Chad Rigetti, founder and CEO of Rigetti Computing, a startup working on superconducting qubits similar to those Google and IBM are developing, agrees that this presents a challenge. But he argues that his chosen technology’s head start will afford ample time and resources to tackle the problem. Google and Rigetti have both said that in just a few years they could build a quantum chip with tens or hundreds of qubits that dramatically outperforms conventional computers on certain problems, even doing useful work on problems in chemistry or machine learning.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 21, 2016 at 12:25PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently appointed former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Stacy Smith as the Executive Vice President responsible for the company's sales, manufacturing, and operations -- arguably making him the most powerful executive at Intel next to only CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel.  Smith recently presented at an investor conference, offering up a wealth of insights into how the company will need to transform its go-to-market strategy as it more aggressively targets the growing Internet of Things market (a market in which Intel is already doing surprisingly well). Let's take a closer look at what he had to say, shall we? Then and now Smith began by saying that the company's sales force "has been designed over the years to be a very efficient functional model." To understand what Smith is saying here, it's important to know what a functional sales model is. Website PM Study Circle has a good explanation of what a functional organization structure is like: A functional organization structure is a hierarchical organization structure wherein people are grouped as per their area of specialization. These people are supervised by a functional manager with expertise in the same field. Going forward, though, Smith says that the company is "toggling toward a sales force that's actually aligned by vertical markets." "And so, we will have a dedicated sales force, for example, for automotive that have very deep skills in that space and can go in to a customer like a BMW or a Delphi, which was announced by them this morning, and do a solution sale that touches all the different parts of Intel," Smith elaborated. Intel is really taking the Internet of Things seriously Intel's Internet of Things business certainly isn't large enough today to really move the needle for the company -- it brings in less than $3 billion in annual revenues to a company that's expected to bring in more than $58 billion in revenue this year. In other words, upside in this business can't offset significant weakness in the company's much larger Data Center Group (DCG) or Client Computing Group (CCG), and weakness in it can't offset good news from either of those two businesses. At least not today. However, if we look at it from a long-term perspective, the potential is clearly there. In 2015, this business segment generated about $2.3 billion in sales, and year-to-date the business has grown by a little more than 14% year-over-year (we'll see the final growth figure for the year when Intel reports its financial results on Jan. 26). Just for the sake of argument, let's assume that Intel can wring out a 15% compounded annual growth rate from this business over the course of the next five years. This business that brought in just $2.3 billion in revenue during 2015 could be a $4.5 billion business by the time 2020 rolls around. At that point, it'd still be a small part of Intel's total revenue, but a $4.5 billion Internet of Things business, combined with a non-volatile memory business that could conceivably grow from around $2.6 billion to roughly $4.5 billion by then, would be $9 billion in non-DCG and non-CCG revenue. Throw in Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) (formerly Altera) and assume that it can get to $2 billion+ revenue by 2020, and Intel now has a trio of non-DCG, non-CCG businesses that together add up to $11 billion in annual revenue. That, collectively, could be enough to compensate for weaknesses or augment strengths elsewhere. And I think that's been Intel's point for quite a while now. It'll be interesting to see what the chip giant's business ultimately looks like in five-to-ten years. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

In this use case tutorial we'll use an Intel® NUC and Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub to interface an industrial fluid/gas pressure sensor to AWS IoT running in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. In this use case tutorial we'll use an Intel® NUC and Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub to interface an industrial fluid/gas pressure sensor to AWS* IoT running in the Amazon Web Services* Cloud. The application software we'll develop will control the pressure sensor and continuously transmit pressure measurements to AWS IoT where the data will be stored, processed and evaluated in the cloud. The pressure sensor is an Omega* PX409-USBH which is a high speed industrial pressure transducer with a USB interface. The sensor is available in a number of different sensing configurations and pressure ranges from vacuum to 5,000 PSI. For this tutorial we'll use model PX409-150GUSBH which is a gage pressure transducer with a measurement range of 0 to 150 PSI. It's designed to connect to piping using a ¼-18 NPT threaded pipe fitting. We'll connect the sensor to a pressurized water line with a secondary gauge for visual inspection of the pressure. Figure 1 shows the sensor configuration and fittings. (1) is the pressure sensor; (2) is the sensor USB cable that will connect to the Intel® NUC; (3) is a secondary gauge for comparison purposes; (4) and (5) are inlet and outlet connections along with control valves for changing the pressure. Figure 1. The Omega PX409-USBH industrial pressure sensor Setup Prerequisites Intel® NUC powered up and connected to a LAN network with Internet access and a development laptop or workstation for logging into the Intel® NUC. Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub running on the Intel® NUC and software updates applied. Package "packagegroup-cloud-aws" installed on the Intel® NUC. An active account on Amazon Web Services and familiarity with the AWS console, AWS IoT, and AWS Elasticsearch Service. Connect Pressure Sensor to the Intel® NUC Connect the pressure sensor USB cable into the USB port on the front of the Intel® NUC. After connecting the sensor the Intel® NUC will automatically assign a TTY device such as /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1. The exact name will vary depending on whether you’ve connected other USB devices to the Intel® NUC. Find the sensor’s device name by logging into the Intel® NUC over the LAN network using ssh. You’ll need to know the Intel® NUC’s IP address assigned on the LAN. For this example the IP address is 192.168.22.100 and the login name is gwuser and password gwuser. ssh gwuser@192.168.22.100

gwuser@WR-IDP-9C99:~$  ls /dev/ttyUSB**
/dev/ttyUSB0 Here we see only one USB device which is named /dev/ttyUSB0 - that’s the pressure sensor. Next we’ll run some verifications tests to confirm the sensor is communicating with the Intel® NUC. Use the screen utility to connect directly to the USB port and manually issue commands. The commands you type won’t be visible – only the results of the commands will display. gwuser@WR-IDP-9C99:~$  sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 Type in ENQ and hit Enter. You should receive a response that looks like this: USBPX2
1.0.13.0826
0.0 to 150.0 PSI G When you see this response it confirms that the pressure sensor is communicating with the Intel® NUC through the USB port. Exit screen by typing these commands: Control-A, Control-\, y. Configure AWS* IoT and Node-RED* Node-RED* is a visual tool for building Internet of Things applications. It’s pre-installed on the Intel® NUC as part of the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub. Log into your AWS account and navigate to the AWS IoT console. Create a new device (thing) named Intel_NUC and a Policy named PubSubToAnyTopic that allows publishing and subscribing to any MQTT topic. Create and activate a new Certificate and download the private key file, certificate file, and root CA file (available here) to your computer. Attach the Intel_NUC device and PubSubToAnyTopic policy to the new certificate. While logged into the Intel® NUC via ssh as gwuser, create the directory /home/gwuser/awsiot and then use SFTP or SCP to copy the downloaded private key file, certificate file and root CA files from your workstation to the /home/gwuser/awsiot directory on the Intel® NUC. Create Node-RED* Sensor Flow In the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub click on the Sensors icon and then the Program Sensors button. This will open the Node-RED canvas. If you get another login prompt use the same gwuser / gwuser login credentials you used when logging into the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub. You will see a default Node-RED flow for a RH-USB sensor. We’re not using that type of sensor here so you can either delete that flow or disable it by double-clicking the Interval node and setting Repeat to none followed by clicking Done. If you don’t delete the flow, select all the elements of the flow using the mouse and drag them down lower on the screen to open up more room at the top. Click the Deploy button to save and activate the changes. First we’ll build a flow that continuously reads the pressure sensor and displays the pressure readings in the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub. Follow these steps: Drag the following types of nodes from the list on the left side onto the canvas and arrange them like shown in Figure 2: (1) inject (input), (2) function (function), (3) serial (output), (4) serial (input), (5) function (function), (6) chart tag (function), (7) mqtt (output). A couple of the names will automatically change when you drop them on the canvas: inject will change to timestamp, and function will change to blank. Use the mouse to draw lines between the nodes so they look like Figure 2. Figure 2. Initial Node-RED flow with nodes and connections Next, double-click on each node corresponding to the numbered callouts and set the node parameters as shown in Figure 3. You may need to move the nodes around to maintain a clean layout. For the serial nodes use the /dev/ttyUSBn device name corresponding to your pressure sensor (we're using /dev/ttyUSB0). The serial port name and parameters are set by clicking the pencil icon next to Add new serial-port… and setting the values as shown in item 3A of Figure 3, then clicking Add. When you're done configuring the nodes the flow should look like Figure 4. Figure 3. Node configuration details Figure 4. Configured Node-RED flow and pressure data display Click the Deploy button to deploy and activate the flow, then click your browser’s refresh button to refresh the entire web page. You should now see a live pressure gauge in the upper part of the Intel® IoT Gateway Hub as shown in Figure 4. You can apply water pressure to the sensor assembly and you’ll see the pressure readings increase and decrease as the pressure varies. Connect Intel® NUC to AWS IoT Drag a mqtt output node onto the Node-RED canvas and then double-click it. In the Server pick list select Add new mqtt-broker… and then click the pencil icon to the right. In the Connection tab, set the Server field to your AWS IoT endpoint address which will look something like aaabbbcccddd.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. You can find the endpoint address by using the AWS CLI command aws iot describe-endpoint on your workstation. Set the Port to 8883 and checkmark Enable secure (SSL/TLS) connection, then click the pencil icon to the right of Add new tls-config… In the Certificate field enter the full path and filename to your certificate file, private key file, and root CA file that you copied earlier into the /home/gwuser/awsiot directory. For example, the Certificate path might look like /home/gwuser/awsiot/1112223333-certificate.pem.crt and the Private Key path might look like /home/user/awsiot/1112223333-private.pem.key. The CA Certificate might look like /home/gwuser/awsiot/VeriSign-Class-3-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem. Checkmark Verify server certificate and leave Name empty. Click the Add button and then click the second Add button to return to the main MQTT out node panel. Set the Topic to nuc/pressure, set QoS to 1, and set Retain to false. Set the Name field to Publish to AWS IoT and then click Done. Drag another function node onto the Node-RED canvas. Double-click to edit the node and set the Name to Format JSON. Edit the function code so it looks like this: msg.payload = {
  pressure: Number(msg.payload),
  timestamp: Date.now()
  };
return msg; Click Done to save the function changes. Draw a wire from the output of the Extract Data node to the input of Format JSON, and another wire from the output of Format JSON to the input of Publish to AWS IoT. These changes will convert the pressure reading into a JSON object and send it to AWS IoT. Click the Deploy button to deploy and activate the changes. The finished flow should look like Figure 5. Figure 5. Finished flow with connection to AWS IoT Back in the AWS IoT console, start the MQTT Client and subscribe to the topic nuc/pressure. You should see messages arriving once a second containing live pressure readings. Vary the pressure on the sensor and observe the values increasing and decreasing. Recording and Visualizing Pressure History in AWS* IoT Now that live pressure data is arriving in AWS IoT, a variety of additional data processing can be performed in the AWS cloud. Here we’ll send the data into Elasticsearch where it can be searched and visualized on dashboards. In the AWS console, navigate to the Elasticsearch Service and provision an Elasticsearch cluster with a domain name of nucdata. You can initially make it a small cluster with one instance. Set the security access policy to your Internet access preferences and also add a policy for principal "AWS": ""* to access "Action": "ESHttpPut". Wait for the cluster provisioning to complete and the Domain status to change to Active. Use curl or a REST tool to create an Elasticsearch index named nucs using the Endpoint URI listed in the AWS Elasticsearch cluster console. When creating the index, include a type named nuc with two properties: pressure of type float and timestamp of type date. In the AWS IoT console, create a Rule named Record_Pressure. Set the Description to Record pressure readings to Elasticsearch, set the Attribute to pressure,timestamp and set the Topic Filter to nuc/pressure. Leave Condition blank. In the action section choose an action of Send the message to a search index cluster (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) and select nucdata for the Domain name. The Endpoint will be filled in automatically. Set the ID to ${newuuid()}, set the Index to nucs, and set the Type to nuc. For the Role name, click Create a new role and set the role name to aws_iot_elasticsearch. Click Add action and then click Create to create the rule. This rule will take data from the nuc/pressure MQTT topic and send it into Elasticsearch where it can be searched and viewed. To search and view data: Navigate to your Elasticsearch cluster Kibana URI and create an index pattern named nucs using timestamp as the Time-field name. You should see pressure and timestamp in the fields list. Navigate to the Kibana Discover tab and enable auto-refresh at a 5 second interval. You should see roughly 5 new data records every 5 seconds – these are the pressure readings coming from the NUC. Navigate to the Visualize tab and create a Line chart time series visualization using X and Y parameters shown in Figure 6. Now vary the actual pressure on the sensor and watch the time series graph in Kibana. Figure 6 shows a live pressure cycle starting at 0 PSI, jumping to 82 PSI, incrementally stepping down to 20 PSI, ramping up to 76 and then 82 PSI, dropping abruptly to 0 PSI, stepping up to 55 PSI for a short period, and then stepping up to 82 PSI.

This article describes another method of programming the robot using the Intel® XDK to program the robot over WiFi, Node.js, and the MRAA library. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Introduction Programmable robotic kits are attainable in many forms these days whether it is from a hobby store or online site like dfrobot.com. There are many different platforms, programming languages, and tools that you can learn. Dfrobot* created a tank robot platform called Devastator that contains the Romeo* controller board. This board was modified for use with the Intel® Edison compute module to bring more capability to the kit with an increased number of I/O’s, integrated WiFi, USB Host, servo control, and increased processing power. The kit can be programmed using the Arduino* IDE and a USB connection out of the box. This article describes another method of programming the robot using the Intel® XDK to program the robot over WiFi, Node.js*, and the MRAA library. In particular, the article will discuss about the tools used, the Romeo controller board, mapping peripheral pins, creating an Intel XDK project, and the implementation of the sensor & actuator components for the robot. The article will conclude by tying together the concepts discussed with a prototype for the robot to operate autonomously and avoid collisions. Getting started with the robotics platform For an introduction and getting started with the Devastator robotics platform please see the link below: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/overview-of-intel-edison-based-robotics-platform Tools Used Node.js* Node.js* is a lightweight JavaScript runtime with a non-blocking I/O model that has a large ecosystem of open source libraries. You can learn more about Node.js from the link below. https://nodejs.org/en/about/ MRAA Library MRAA is a Linux based open source low level C peripheral library that has bindings for C++, Python, Node.js, and Java languages. This gives a developer flexibility in choosing a familiar language when developing an IoT application. The library supports a variety of x86 and ARM platforms and has a common API. Intel® Edison comes with the MRAA libraries pre-installed on its Linux image and the Intel XDK can manage updating the libraries to the latest. To learn more about MRAA, please see the links below. https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/edison.html Intel XDK The Intel XDK is a full IDE for developing, programming, and debugging an Intel® Edison IoT application over a WiFi connection. It comes with the Node.js environment setup and is MRAA ready. The tool is free and can be downloaded from the link below. https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk Romeo Intel® Edison Controller Board Reviewing the schematic helps in understanding the key components in the system and how you can best map the available peripherals to the sensors and actuators used by the robot. The robot uses a variety of peripherals to accomplish its tasks. Below is a listing of component to peripheral pin mapping for the robot. An additional mapping is made from the physical pin to the MRAA pin. This pin mapping is what we will use in the code when initializing the peripherals. It should also be noted that there are level translators on the board. These pins are also indicated in the table below to aid in correlation when viewing the schematic. Component: Peripheral: Intel® Edison Pin: Translated Pin: MRAA Pin: Passive Infrared Sensor Digital Input GPIO43 D11 38 Tilt Servo PWM PWM1 D5 14 Pan Servo PWM PWM0 D3 20 Ultrasonic Sensor UART TX UART RX GP131 GP130 D1/TX D0/RX UART0 Left LED Digital Output GPIO48 D7 33 Right LED Digital Output GPIO41 D10 51 Buzzer PWM PWM2 D6 0 Brushed DC Motors I2C SCL I2C SDA SDA1 SCL1 I2C1_SDA I2C1_SDL I2C0 The MRAA pin mapping table for Intel® Edison can be found at the link below. http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/edison.html The Romeo schematic can be downloaded from the link below https://github.com/Arduinolibrary/DFRobot_Intel_Edison/blob/master/Romeo%20for%20Edison%20Controller%20Schematic.pdf?raw=true Creating an Intel XDK Project Now that we have discussed the tools used and studied the schematic, we are ready to create a new project in the Intel XDK and start developing code for the robot. To create a new project: Click New Project Button Click Blank Iot Node.js Template Give Name->Click Create Connect to the board Click Upgrade XDK daemon and Update libraries on board Sensor & Actuator Components Implementation Now that we have a new project created and have connected to the board, we are ready to write some code for interfacing to the LEDs, infrared sensor, servo, buzzer, ultrasonic sensor, and brushed dc motor components. MRAA Initialization Initializing the MRAA library in the project is done with the code below. //MRAA Initialization
var m = require("mraa"); Indication LEDs Two indication LEDs are mounted on the front of the robot. For example, these can be used for indication of robot direction, object detection & distance. Initializing the LEDs is done by creating 2 MRAA GPIO objects for MRAA pins 33 and 51. The pins are both set to an OUTPUT with the dir() function with a LOW value by default. var leftLED = new m.Gpio(33);
var rightLED = new m.Gpio(51);
leftLED.dir(m.DIR_OUT_LOW);
rightLED.dir(m.DIR_OUT_LOW); Typical LED functions are to turn on, off, and toggle the LEDs. This can be accomplished with the code below shown for the right LED using the GPIO write() and read() functions. //Turn On
rightLED.write(1);

//Turn Off
rightLED.write(0);

//Toggle
rightLED.write(rightLED.read()^1); Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) The passive infrared sensor is mounted on the rear of the tank robot and can give indication of movement while the tank is moving backwards. The sensor gives a HIGH indication if there is motion detected or a LOW indication is there is no motion. Initialization for this sensor is similar to the LED that it uses a GPIO object for MRAA pin 38, but the sensor is configured as an INPUT using the dir() function. var pirMotionSensor = new m.Gpio(38);
pirMotionSensor.dir(m.DIR_IN); Detecting motion is also simple by polling the sensor with the function below. Polling the sensor is done using the GPIO read() function. If motion is detected the function returns TRUE, if no motion is detected the function returns FALSE. function isMotionDetected() {
    if (pirMotionSensor.read())
        return true;
    else
        return false;
} Servos The tank contains two servos. The first servo is used for panning an ultrasonic sensor and camera. Panning will allow the tank to look left and right and determine what is in its proximity. The second servo is used for tilting the camera angle up or down. Standard servo interfaces expect a pulse periodically at least every 20ms or 50Hz. The pulse width determines the servo position and is between 1ms-2ms to configure the servo position. For example a 1ms pulse width moves the servo to the 0 degree position, a 1.5ms pulse width moves the servo to the 90 degree neutral position, and a 2ms pulse moves the servo to the 180 degree position. Implementing this is easily accomplished using the pulse width modulation (PWM) peripheral. Initializing the servos is done by creating 2 MRAA PWM objects using MRAA pin 14 for tilt and MRAA pin 20 for pan. The servos period is configured by using the PWM period_us() function that sets up the period in microseconds. After the peripheral is initialized the servos are centered to the neutral position by calling the panCenter() and tiltCenter() functions. var tiltServo = new m.Pwm(14);  //PWM1
var panServo = new m.Pwm(20);   //PWM0
tiltServo.period_us(10000);  //100Hz -> 10ms Period
panServo.period_us(10000);   //100Hz -> 10ms Period
panCenter();
tiltCenter(); Moving the pan servo is accomplished below with functions to panRight(), panLeft(), and panCenter(). The functions configure the pulse width of the PWM peripheral by calling the pulsewidth_us() function and then turning on the peripheral by calling the enable(true) function. A short delay is called with the sleep() function to allow the servo to move and then the peripheral is disabled by calling the enable(false) function. function panRight() {
    panServo.enable(false);
    panServo.pulsewidth_us(1000); //0 degree position
    panServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    panServo.enable(false);
}

function panLeft() {
    panServo.enable(false);
    panServo.pulsewidth_us(2000); //180 degree position
    panServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    panServo.enable(false);
}

function panCenter() {
    panServo.enable(false);
    panServo.pulsewidth_us(1500); //90 degree position
    panServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    panServo.enable(false);
} Moving the tilt servo up or down is a similar task to what we did with the pan servo except that the angles used are different after experimentation to determine what is practical. The functions for tiltUp(), tiltDown(), and tiltCenter() are listed below. function tiltUp() {
    tiltServo.enable(false);
    tiltServo.pulsewidth_us(1250); //45 degree position
    tiltServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    tiltServo.enable(false);
}

function tiltDown() {
    tiltServo.enable(false);
    tiltServo.pulsewidth_us(1750); //135 degree position
    tiltServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    tiltServo.enable(false);
}

function tiltCenter() {
    tiltServo.enable(false);
    tiltServo.pulsewidth_us(1500); //90 degree position
    tiltServo.enable(true);
    sleep(200);
    tiltServo.enable(false);
} Buzzer The tank contains a buzzer that can be used for audible indication of events. For example, as the tank gets close to an object it could sound different notes from the c major scale to indicate its proximity. The buzzer also uses the PWM peripheral so initialization and usage will be similar to what we did with the servos. It is a little different mindset than the servos because we are using the PWM peripheral as a simple digital to analog converter (DAC). Initializing the buzzer is done with a MRAA PWM object on MRAA pin 0. The amplitude is configured with the write() function for configuring the PWM duty cycle and is initialized to 0. The peripheral is disabled by calling the enable(false) function. var buzzer = new m.Pwm(0);  //PWM2
buzzer.write(0.0);  //Duty Cycle
buzzer.enable(false); Creating sounds with the buzzer is accomplished by setting the sound frequency using the period_us() function and then enabling the sound by calling the enable(true) function. Below is an example function for playing one octave of the C major scale that could be used as an indication tone when the robot is initialized. A simple 125ms timer loop that plays a note and increments to the next note over the octave. var state2=0;
var handle2=setInterval(notes,125); //125ms timer loop

function notes() {
    switch (state2){
        
        //C4
        case 0: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(3831); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //D4
        case 1: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(3412); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //E4
        case 2: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(3039); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //F4
        case 3: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(2865); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //G4
        case 4: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(2551); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //A4
        case 5: buzzer.enable(false); buzzer.period_us(2272); buzzer.enable(true); state2++; break;
        
        //B4
        case 6: buzzer.enable(false);buzzer.period_us(2028); buzzer.enable(true);state2++; break;
        
        //C5
        case 7: buzzer.enable(false);buzzer.period_us(1912); buzzer.enable(true);state2++; break;    
        
        //End
        default: clearInterval(handle2); state2=0; buzzer.enable(false); break;
    }
} Ultrasonic Sensor The ultrasonic sensor is used on the robot to determine its distance to an object. It is mounted on the front of the robot and can be panned left and right to look around using the pan servo mentioned earlier. The sensor has 3 different interfaces for gathering the distance data. There is a PWM output, analog output, or UART interface. You can learn more about this sensor at the wiki below which contains useful information about the sensor, its different interfaces, and command protocol. https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/URM37_V4.0_Ultrasonic_Sensor_(SKU:SEN0001)#Introduction For our Node.js program the UART interface is used with this sensor to read the distance data. The sensors TXD pin 9 is connected to Intel® Edison RX GP130 and the sensors RXD pin 8 is connected to Intel® Edison TX GP131. Initializing the UART is done by creating a MRAA UART object. The baud rate is set to 9600 bps using the setBaudRate() function, the data mode is setup using the setMode(), and flow control is setup using the setFlowControl() function. In addition, the command buffer is setup for reading the sensor data. The command buffer byte 0 contains the command code, bytes 1&2 are dummy bytes, and byte 3 is a checksum of the packet. var u = new m.Uart(0); //Default
u.setBaudRate(9600);
u.setMode(8,0,1);
u.setFlowcontrol(false, false);
sleep(200);    
var command = new Buffer(4);
command[0] = 0x22;
command[1] = 0x00;
command[2] = 0x00;
command[3] = 0x22; Getting the distance data from the sensor involves sending a command packet out the UART and then receiving the response packet. The function below determines if an object is close given a threshold and returns TRUE or FALSE. The command packet was setup in the initialization above and is sent out the UART by calling the write() function. The response packet is received after a delay and then calling the read() function. The response packet buffer byte 0 is a dummy byte, bytes 1 & 2 are the high and low bytes respectively corresponding to the distance data in cm, and byte 3 is the checksum. To determine if the data is valid the checksum is analyzed and then the data is compared to a threshold passed in. function isObjectClose(threshold) {
    var rxBuf;
    var result;
    u.write(command);
    sleep(200);

} Brushed DC Motors The tank is able to move in a forward, backward, left, or right direction. The robot contains two brushed dc motors that are mounted across from each other on the right and left side of the tank chassis. After reviewing the schematic, you will see that the Romeo board contains a full bridge motor control driver that is connected to an Atmega8* microcontroller. The interface used by Intel® Edison to communicate to the microcontroller is I2C. It is useful to review the code implemented in this microcontroller to learn about the I2C slave address that is programmed and the command interface for controlling the motors. The Intel® Edison is the I2C master and the microcontroller is the I2C slave at address 0x4. You can find more information about the microcontroller code at the link below: https://github.com/ouki-wang/remeo4edison/blob/master/NG/NG.ino See the table below to determine the correlation between tank direction and motor direction Direction: Left Motor Right Motor Forward Counter-Clockwise Counter-Clockwise Backward Clockwise Clockwise Left Counter-Clockwise Clockwise Right Clockwise Counter-Clockwise Initializing the I2C peripheral is done by creating a new MRAA I2C object. The slave address is set by calling the address() function. The command buffer is also initialized and contains a header at bytes 0 & 1. The remaining bytes in the command packet are discussed below. var x = new m.I2c(0);
x.address(4);
var buf = new Buffer(5);
buf[0] = 0x55;  //Header 1
buf[1] = 0xaa;  //Header 2 The function below moves the tank in a forward direction given the 8-bit speed value passed to the function. The function sets up I2C commands to setup the left motor direction, right motor direction, left motor speed, and right motor speed. The remaining command bytes in the command buffer are the command code at byte 2 for doing either a motor direction command or motor speed command, command argument at byte 3 for setting the motor direction value or motor speed value, and a checksum at byte 4. The I2C command is sent by calling the write() function. function tankForward(speed) {
    if (speed > 0xFF)
        speed = 0xFF;

    //Left Motor CounterClockwise
    buf[2] = 0xB1;

} Autonomous Robot Now that we have built a foundation of functions using the MRAA library for interfacing to the sensors and actuators, we can start to tie it together by creating a state machine that allows the robot to move autonomously and avoid collisions. The concept is that the tank will try and move forward until it detects that an object is close. When an object is close it will attempt to move backwards if there is not motion behind it. The tank will attempt to go left or right to avoid the object and then attempt to go forward again. Please see the flow chart diagrams below that describe movement in the forward, backward, left, and right states and the implementation that follows. Flow Chart Diagrams Implementation var state=0;     //0-forward 1-backward 2-right 3-left
var turnDirection=0; //0-right 1-left

while(1) {
    switch (state) {
        //Forward State

            panCenter();
            if (isObjectClose(10)) {

The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ AP-SITE Intel Group via AP, File TORONTO – The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in 2012 while travelling in a mountainous region of northern Afghanistan. In a video uploaded to YouTube earlier this week, Coleman — sitting next to her husband and two young children — urges governments on all sides to reach a deal to secure the family’s freedom. Boyle’s parents, Patrick and Linda Boyle, said they watched the video on Monday, getting their first glimpse at their young grandsons. “It is an indescribable emotional sense one has watching a grandson making faces at the camera, while hearing our son’s leg chains clanging up and down on the floor as he tries to settle his son,” the Boyles said in a written statement. “It is unbelievable that they have had to shield their sons from their horrible reality for four years.” The parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife have tried to protect their children by pretending their signs of captivity are part of a game being played with guards. “It is simply heartbreaking to watch both boys so keenly observing their new surroundings in a makeshift film studio, while listening to their mother describe how they were made to watch her being defiled,” the Boyles said. The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. The group said the video was dated Dec. 3. In the clip, Coleman says her family has been waiting since 2012 for somebody to understand the “Kafkaesque nightmare” they are living. “We understand both sides hate us and are content to leave us and our two surviving children in these problems but we can only ask and pray that somebody will recognize the atrocities these men carry out against us,” she is heard saying. The Boyles said their daughter-in-law could not have used a more accurate term than kafkaesque. “The absence of a clear course of action to escape a complex and bizarre situation that seems it may be somewhere between fiction and reality. Overpowered and constrained by others beyond their control, but striving to break through nonetheless,” the Boyles said. They said the video appears to confirm that those holding their son and family captive “want to bring this to an end soon.” “They prefer to reach an understanding during this brief period of the American presidential transition,” the Boyles said. “It also confirms the seriousness and immediacy of the captors’ threats to our four family members.” The Boyles said they hope all governments involved will bring their son’s case to a safe resolution soon. A spokesman with Global Affairs Canada said the federal government is “deeply concerned” about the safety and well-being of Joshua Boyle and his family and calls for their unconditional release. Coleman’s parents say they are hoping U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will broker her release if President Barack Obama doesn’t succeed before he leaves office. Jim and Lyn Coleman, of Stewartstown, Pa., spoke to ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday, saying they took solace in seeing their daughter and grandkids looking healthy and in seeing the children for the first time. “You just want to reach out, you know, and hold them,” Lyn Coleman said of her grandchildren. “And that’s very difficult.” Joshua Boyle and Coleman vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman’s parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what he described as an “unsafe” part of Afghanistan. In 2013, the couple appeared in two videos asking the U.S. government to free them from the Taliban. Coleman’s parents received a letter last November in which their daughter said she had given birth to a second child in captivity. A video released in August showed Coleman and Boyle warning that their captors would kill them and their children unless the government in Kabul ends its execution of Taliban prisoners.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 20, 2016 at 6:20PM Much of the revenue that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) enjoys from its data center group (DCG) comes from the sale of central processing units (CPUs). However, at its investor meeting back in late 2015, Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant said that the of the 15% compounded annual revenue growth (CAGR) that the company expected to see from DCG between 2015 and 2019, 3% of that growth rate would come from non-CPU products. Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant holding a silicon photonics module, one of the products that Intel is banking on for growth outside of CPUs. Image source: Intel.  Put another way, since Intel expected its CPU business within DCG to grow at a 12% CAGR through 2019, the growth rate of its non-CPU business would have to be substantially higher to bring the business unit CAGR to 15% (since the non-CPU part of the business was, in 2015, dramatically smaller than its CPU business). Let's look at how the non-CPU business within Intel's DCG trended throughout 2016 and what drivers are expected to continue to fuel its growth in the years ahead. Outpacing CPUs in 2016 Over the last three quarters, the non-CPU business within DCG saw revenue growth of 17.8% over the first three quarters of 2015, hitting $979 million (up from $831 million). The revenue growth that Intel saw from "platforms" (essentially CPUs and their related chipsets) in DCG over that time was just 6.89% -- less than half the growth rate of the non-CPU business. The total year-to-date revenue growth rate in this business for Intel has been around 7.67%, so the non-CPU business contributed to just under one percentage point of the total growth rate. Ramping up across 2016; implied 42.6% growth rate through 2019 The year-over-year growth in DCG's non-CPU revenues has accelerated throughout 2016. In the first quarter the growth rate was just 7.25%. It accelerated to 10.75% during the second quarter, and then skyrocketed to 33.57% during the third quarter of 2016. The company's fourth-quarter results aren't in yet (they'll be available in late January), but I wouldn't be surprised if the growth rate in Intel's non-CPU DCG business stayed at elevated levels in the fourth quarter of 2016. Intel's previous DCG growth rate expectation seems to suggest that investors will see a significant acceleration in that growth rate over the next couple of years. To deconstruct the math, if Intel's DCG grew at a 15% compounded annual growth rate from 2015 through 2019 and Intel expected CPUs/platforms to grow at a 12% compounded annual growth rate through that period, this would imply roughly $4.53 billion in non-CPU DCG revenue by 2019 -- up from $1.095 billion in 2015. That, for what it's worth, implies a 42.6% compounded annual growth rate for the non-CPU portion of Intel's DCG through 2019 -- significantly higher than what the company is likely to see in 2016. Now, Intel isn't expecting to hit 15% growth in DCG this year, lowering its full-year guidance for DCG to "high-single digits" (i.e., 7% to 9%), but the point is clear: Intel is expecting some phenomenal growth from the non-CPU portions of DCG out in time. Some notes of caution The recent acceleration in the revenue growth rate in this sub-segment of DCG is encouraging, but investors should always keep in mind that having visibility into business trends even just a couple of quarters out, let alone several years out, is extremely tough. That's why, even though Intel has had its 15% DCG compounded annual growth rate target out there for years, it has very rarely actually hit it.  Take Intel's long-term growth targets, both for DCG and those implied for each sub-segment of DCG (CPU and non-CPU), for what they are: goals that the company is aspiring to, not hard-and-fast guarantees.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News Motherboards ASRock Fatal1ty and Extreme4 Z270 motherboards detailed ASRock's new Kaby Lake-supported Z270 motherboards get detailed ahead of CES 2017 By: Derek Strickland | Motherboards News | Posted: 1 week, 5 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Specs and details ASRock's new Fatal1ty and Extreme4 Z270 motherboards have surfaced, giving us a good look at the boards ahead of their CES 2017 showcase.     With Intel's seventh-gen Kaby Lake CPUs on their way, hardware-makers are busy readying their fleets of new 200-series motherboards, giving consumers lots of possible upgrade mobo paths to Z270 chipset adoption. ASRock's new Fatal1ty Gaming K6 and Extreme4 mobos use the LGA1151 socket and support both 7th-gen Kaby Lake and 6th-gen Skylake processors, and also have native support for Intel's new high-end Optane 3DXpoint 3D NAND SSD storage lineup.     Let's start with ASRock's Extreme4 Z270 motherboard. This is a standard ATX motherboard that features HDMI, DVI-D, and D-Sub display slots (no DisplayPort), three PCIe 3.0 x16 lanes (two of which are outfitted with steel bracing) that support up to three AMD GPUs in CrossFireX or two NVIDIA GPUs in SLI.     The Extreme4 Z270's four DDR4 DIMM slots can power up to 64GB of dual-channel DDR4-3866 memory. Storage outlets include eight SATA III 6Gb/s ports and two M.2 sockets.   The Extreme4 features eight USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 3.1 ports (Type-A and Type-C) on the rear. Onboard LED and RGB lighting on the header splash some style to the mobo.     The ASRock Fatal1ty Gaming K6 Z270 ATX motherboard is almost identical to the Extreme4. The differences include a Dual Intel LAN, Creative SoundBlaster Cinema 3 audio, all-steel PCIe 16x slots, gold audio jacks, and of course the red-on-black color scheme.   ASRock should showcase these motherboards in full at CES 2017 in January, so keep a look out for that coverage.   NEWS SOURCES:Videocardz.com Recommended for You Motherboard makers are excited for AMD's new Ryzen...

By Ian King. Added by Agency Staff on 22 December 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Elon Musk, Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Tesla Tweet Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang When Paulina Sliwinska, a fund manager at Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford & Co, made the trip to Silicon Valley looking for the next big thing in technology, she found it — not in a hot start-up run by a 23-year-old whiz kid just out of Stanford, but in a 23-year-old semiconductor maker that’s had the same chief executive since its founding. Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of graphics chip maker Nvidia, has won over Sliwinska and many other investors this year with claims that his products, once confined to the niche of computer gaming machines, are breaking out to become key components of nascent technologies from voice recognition to self-driving cars. “He’s so engaging,” said Sliwinska. “Even from this point the opportunities in front of it over the next 10 years are astonishing.” After she met Huang in August, the fund added to its position and is now the 10th largest holder. The company is the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year, outpacing the number two stock by a multiple of almost three. Under Huang, Nvidia has built itself into the leading supplier of graphics processors, the chips that deliver the ever-more-realistic images that make computer games so immersive and addictive. For most of its history, that’s been a relatively small market, with the much bigger businesses of computer processors and smartphone chips dominated by Intel and Qualcomm. This year, though, Huang’s longtime belief that the fundamental advantages of his graphics chips would give them a broader role in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has begun to pay off — and is buoying Nvidia’s earnings. In the third quarter, demand for chips used in data centers and cars helped fuel a 54% surge in sales, and profit doubled to a record. That performance was the result of years of investment in the hardware and software aimed at enabling computers and cars to think for themselves, according to Huang. The stock surged 30% on 11 November, the day after the earnings report. Yet there was no victory lap from the CEO — his company is going to battle in markets also targeted by famously fierce rivals Intel, whose annual R&D spending is twice Nvidia’s revenue, and Qualcomm, which has the largest cash balance in the chip industry. “The only thing we can guarantee is the velocity with which we innovate,” Huang said in an interview at the time. Nvidia declined to make Huang available for comment for this story. Huang, 53, runs Nvidia like it’s still a start-up, making snap decisions and demanding fast execution, according to those who have worked for him. For a semiconductor maker, that’s no small feat: designing a chip, getting it ready for market and then having it manufactured can take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Chip companies publish road maps that reflect those intricate details, and they build their organisations around it. Decisions on what to make in multibillion-dollar plants requires extensive planning. At Nvidia things can happen a lot faster. In the space of a short meeting hosted by Huang, an executive trying to give an update on progress of a new chip design might find himself silenced as Huang calls an engineer to check on a technical question — then instantly decide the project’s dead or make the call to head in a different direction. Huang has long clung to the belief that graphics chips would play a key role in technological innovation. But past efforts to spread their use, such as in phones, have failed to catch on or taken a lot longer to deliver tangible results. While the annual advent of a new high-end GeForce chip from Nvidia has long been viewed as a gift from above for computer gamers — many of whom think nothing of paying more for one component than most ordinary users would for a whole computer — Nvidia as a company had been less revered in general until this year. Its stock has struggled to rise higher than US$35 in the 17 years since it first went public. The shares closed just above $105 on 20 December. Some investors and analysts who follow Nvidia the most closely have missed that run-up. The reason: they’ve heard Huang’s pitches before — such as when he was touting the company’s future as a provider of smartphone chips — and initially wrote off his predictions about artificial intelligence and self-driving cars as no different from previous forays that fizzled. “Jen-Hsun didn’t dial it up or dial it down — he was just as enthusiastic about the automotive opportunity as he was for Tegra,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners, referring to the company’s mobile phone chip, first announced in 2008. Jen Hsun-Huang with Tesla CEO Elon Musk The Tegra line of chips was Nvidia’s attempt to get into smartphones, which Huang correctly pointed out were on the cusp of transforming computing and communication. Yet because he and others underestimated the importance of an integrated cellular connection, Nvidia’s offering failed to win significant business. Unlike other companies that lost out to Qualcomm, Huang didn’t close down the project — instead Nvidia fielded its own game console, called Shield, as a way to try to create a market for Tegra and showcase its abilities to potential customers. While Shield never challenged the dominance of Xbox or PlayStation, the product led to orders for Tegra from Nintendo, which made the chip the heart of one its new game systems. “It was more or less a science project internal to Nvidia, and now Nintendo has adopted it,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “That’s another example of them pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, creating a market and then giving it to their customer.” Little sleep The CEO gets little sleep, even on holidays, because he stays up late into the night reading everything he can get his hands on that concerns Nvidia and its businesses, no matter the language — he is fastidious about translations, which he has staff ready to deliver whenever he needs them. While founding Nvidia and building it into the largest maker of graphics chips has made him a billionaire, he still runs the company with the paranoia and drive of someone scared it might fail at any moment, according to those who have worked for him. In public he speaks in soft tones, using careful pauses for emphasis and employing Silicon Valley’s patois to answer specific questions with broad, lofty discussions that contain grand assertions. Within the company, he has little patience for subordinates who aren’t making the grade and will call them to scream whenever he deems it necessary. The way he describes it, Huang has always been fighting the bigger guy. He likes to tell the story of how his Taiwanese parents sent him to be educated at what they thought was a private school in the US when he was a child. The institution in Kentucky turned out to be more of a reform school, where he was one of the smallest guys in a rough environment having to get by on his wits and form alliances with the big kids. Huang’s grown-up bête noire, Intel, is located just across the 101 freeway, which runs the length of California’s Silicon Valley. This other Santa Clara-based chip maker is also the world’s largest. Analysts who in the past have been unwilling to bet on Huang’s vision and execution have cited Intel’s ability to build other computer functions into its processors as an existential threat to Nvidia. Indeed, Nvidia’s chipset business disappeared almost overnight when Intel decided to build that technology into its products, starting in 2008. Still, Intel has never fielded a graphics chip good enough to persuade high-end computer users to switch from Nvidia. And now Huang’s company is trying to muscle in on the rapidly growing market for chips used in data center servers, Intel’s most profitable business. Data flood Traditional data centres are stacked with machines powered by Intel’s most expensive server chips, and many would-be competitors have been trying to break Intel’s lock on the market. Now, the flood of information created by connected devices and online services is overwhelming conventional computing’s ability to analyze and put this data to use. Based on work Nvidia has been doing for several years, graphics chips are increasingly being programmed to run artificial intelligence systems that can perform tasks such as recognising images and speech lightning-fast, without the help of humans. While Intel processors are extremely fast at performing complex operations, they have a limit in terms of their ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time. That’s where graphics chips have started to make inroads with their ability to perform a much larger number of smaller tasks in parallel. Google and Amazon.com offer graphics-chip-based computing as part of their cloud services. While graphics technology is making headway, the majority of data centre work is done by Intel’s microprocessors and there are efforts by suppliers of other types of chips to tailor their less-power-hungry products for the market. For now, investors think Nvidia is leading efforts to provide the main engine for artificial intelligence. “They’re in one of the hottest spaces,” said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager for Synovus Trust Company. “You’d have to put them at the top of the list right now. They seem to be positioned really well.” In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s data centre revenue, at $240m, was up from just $82m a year earlier. But that’s barely scratching the surface of a market where Intel has more than 99% market share in processors. The larger company’s server chip business delivered more than $2bn in profit on $4,5bn of sales in its latest quarter. In cars, one of Huang’s passions, Nvidia is aiming to provide the computing engines that will someday make vehicles better than humans at driving. While Tegra is used to run entertainment systems, Nvidia has produced more powerful graphics chips to do the work of taking inputs from radar, cameras and other sensors to build an electronic picture of what’s going on around the vehicle. There’s no shortage of competition from other chip makers, though, and last year Nvidia didn’t make it into the list of top 10 providers of silicon to automakers. One chip maker that did, NXP Semiconductor, last year bought another, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Nvidia’s mobile nemesis, Qualcomm. The Nvidia CEO’s willingness to make rapid changes of direction has already manifested itself in cars. Once famous for his love of Ferraris, Huang is now posting pictures of himself on his driveway surrounded by Teslas. Probably no coincidence: the first new version of his complete computer for self-driving cars was delivered personally to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia’s technology is the basis for Telsa’s next version of its driver-assistance technology.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet sid_SrIDdhar347 And here I am thinking that Musk becoming the Tony Stark of the real world is all but nonsense.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Dec 22, 2016 at 7:04AM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a great growth stock this year, soaring more than 200% on robust sales of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But as I mentioned in a recent article, it isn't a great dividend stock. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's forward yield of 0.6% is much lower than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%, and its dividend hikes have been unpredictable, with one hike this year, two hikes last year, but no hikes at all in 2014. Investors looking for better income plays should check out three other chipmakers instead -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Intel Shares of Intel have only advanced 5% this year, due to sluggish growth in its core PC and data center markets. It also abandoned the mobile market after failing to secure a significant market share with billions in subsidies, its Internet of Things (IoT) business faces tough competition from ARM-licensed rivals like Qualcomm, and new x86 chips from a resurgent AMD could throttle its sales of PC chips next year. Despite those challenges, analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 6% and 15% this year -- indicating that its growth will remain slow but steady. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 18 is much lower than NVIDIA's P/E of 66 and the industry average of 22. Intel pays a forward yield of 2.8%, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 48%. Over the past 12 months, Intel spent 46% of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends, indicating that it has plenty of room for higher payments. But like NVIDIA, Intel hasn't been consistent with its dividend hikes -- its quarterly dividend stayed at $0.23 for three years before finally being raised to $0.25 in 2014, and to $0.26 in 2015. Qualcomm Investors looking for a better balance between growth and income can consider Qualcomm, which has surged 33% this year but still pays a forward yield of 3.1%. That dividend accounted for 53% of Qualcomm's earnings and 44% of its FCF over the past 12 months. Qualcomm has hiked that dividend annually for 13 straight years. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm's rally might seem odd, since analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 1% and 6% this year. Its mobile chipmaking businesses, which generates most of its revenue, faces sluggish smartphone sales, competition from cheaper rivals like MediaTek, and first-party ARM chipsets in Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi devices. Meanwhile, its patent licensing business -- which generates most of its profits -- faces defiant smartphone OEMs and regulators that claim that its cut of the wholesale price of each device sold (up to 5%) is too high. Qualcomm has expanded into adjacent markets -- like wearables, drones, and connected cars -- to offset those declines. Its acquisition of IoT chipmaker CSR and its upcoming purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors will both pivot the company away from mobile devices. Even after crushing the market this year, Qualcomm stock still remains fairly cheap at 17 times earnings. Texas Instruments Investors looking for more predictable dividend hikes should consider Texas Instruments, the diversified chipmaker that has promised to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders with dividends and buybacks. It's raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years, and pays a forward yield of 2.7%. Those payments were covered by 48% of its earnings and 39% of its FCF over the past 12 months. TI doesn't make high-powered application processors like Intel or Qualcomm. It mainly produces cheaper analog and embedded chips for connected cars, industrial machines, wireless infrastructure, consumer electronics, and enterprise systems. That diversified customer base allows growth in certain markets to offset cyclical declines in others. However, TI remains highly exposed to Apple, which accounted for 11% of its revenues last year. Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP, which will create the world's biggest automotive chipmaker, could also hurt its automotive chip business. Analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 2% and 12% this year, but its P/E of 25 -- which was inflated by its 33% rally this year -- remains lofty relative to its industry peers. The bottom line There are plenty of reasons to buy NVIDIA, but its paltry dividend isn't one of them. Intel, Qualcomm, and TI all offer better yields at lower valuations, but investors should carefully weigh their strengths and weaknesses to see if they're good long-term income plays.   Leo Sun owns shares of QCOM.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Dec 22, 2016 at 7:04AM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a great growth stock this year, soaring more than 200% on robust sales of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But as I mentioned in a recent article, it isn't a great dividend stock. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's forward yield of 0.6% is much lower than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%, and its dividend hikes have been unpredictable, with one hike this year, two hikes last year, but no hikes at all in 2014. Investors looking for better income plays should check out three other chipmakers instead -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Intel Shares of Intel have only advanced 5% this year, due to sluggish growth in its core PC and data center markets. It also abandoned the mobile market after failing to secure a significant market share with billions in subsidies, its Internet of Things (IoT) business faces tough competition from ARM-licensed rivals like Qualcomm, and new x86 chips from a resurgent AMD could throttle its sales of PC chips next year. Despite those challenges, analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 6% and 15% this year -- indicating that its growth will remain slow but steady. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 18 is much lower than NVIDIA's P/E of 66 and the industry average of 22. Intel pays a forward yield of 2.8%, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 48%. Over the past 12 months, Intel spent 46% of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends, indicating that it has plenty of room for higher payments. But like NVIDIA, Intel hasn't been consistent with its dividend hikes -- its quarterly dividend stayed at $0.23 for three years before finally being raised to $0.25 in 2014, and to $0.26 in 2015. Qualcomm Investors looking for a better balance between growth and income can consider Qualcomm, which has surged 33% this year but still pays a forward yield of 3.1%. That dividend accounted for 53% of Qualcomm's earnings and 44% of its FCF over the past 12 months. Qualcomm has hiked that dividend annually for 13 straight years. Image source: Qualcomm.

McIntyre December 22, 2016 6:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Most of the 30 components of the Dow have risen by double-digit percentages this year. Four are up over 30%. These double-digit stocks have helped put the Dow up over 14% this year to 19,942. Five stocks will keep it from topping 20,000. Pfizer Despite the fact that the huge pharmaceutical company raised its dividend by 7%, it has disappointed investors with three quarters of poor guidance. In its most recently reported quarter, at $0.61 Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) missed Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) estimates by two cents. Looking forward, management was more pessimistic than expected. Pfizer chopped its EPS forecast for the year from a range of $2.38 to $2.48 to a new range of $2.38 to $2.43. Whatever rally the Dow stages, Pfizer will be a boat anchor. Investors have no reason to believe its prospects will improve until early next year, if at all. Coca-Cola Coke’s old CEO is out, and another Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) executive is in. That probably has little to do with Coke’s major problems, which will not be easy to solve. The first is a relentless drum beat from health experts about the dangers of sugar. As obesity and diabetes grow across most of the developed world, the old snacks are being replaced by healthier foods. In the emerging markets, slowing economies may undermine consumer spending. Coke has few large markets where it can turn to for growth. Intel The huge chip company restructured early this year. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) plans to fire 12,000 people, which is over 10% of its global workforce. More recently, it let go the employees from its wearable division. Intel has shrinking opportunities as it moves away from the low-end PC chip market and toward mobile and server markets, which are already awash in competition from firms that have been in those businesses for years. Note that shares of chip maker and rival NVIDIA are up the most of any stock in the S&P 500 so far in 2016. Apple Between fights with the European Union over billions of dollars in taxes and worry that the iPhone 7 will not have a holiday home run, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has reached a near-term cap. In addition, its offshore manufacturing has been a perfect target for Donald’s Trump’s plans to punish American companies with workforces or supplier workforces that are largely overseas. There is also a growing body of evidence that Apple is struggling in China, to a large extent because of competition from local mobile companies Huawei, OPPO and Xiaomi. CEO Tim Cook says Apple’s success hinges on China sales. General Electric The world’s largest conglomerate has failed at a series of reinventions, one of the biggest of which is a recent plan to move away from the financial services business that nearly swamped General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) during the financial crisis. Management recently backed its guidance for the year ahead. And the company plans to sell its water business and part of its industrial division. GE’s aviation business worries investors as the market for large commercial planes slows. GE’s mining and drilling infrastructure operations have a limited future, unless oil exploration and commodities metals prices have a large bounce back.

Think of it like a powerful, do-it-yourself Netflix that gives users remote access to videos and pictures. As a service, Plex continues improving with new community-requested features. However, Plex isn’t as simple as downloading software. Unlike Netflix or Hulu, Plex requires a server. Users are responsible for setting up their own server. And that requires hardware. (For those new to Plex, check out our awesome Plex manual Your Guide To Plex - The Awesome Media Center Your Guide To Plex - The Awesome Media Center Love your digital collection of movies, TV shows and music, but hate using clumsy interfaces to play them on your TV? It's time to check out Plex, the ultimate media center software. Read More .) Plex Media Server Specs When it comes to HTPC hardware, you may assume that the graphics processing unit (GPU) is the essential part. In fact, most recent integrated GPUs are perfectly sufficient for pushing 1080p and sometimes even 4K content. With a Plex server, you don’t even need a monitor. Rather than a powerful GPU, you’ll want a beefy central processing unit (CPU). Plex recommends generally an Intel Core i3 or better. For transcoding, you need a processor with around 2,000 PassMark for a 1080p stream and 1,500 for 720p. Whether you’re building your own or buying a pre-built system, operating system is a major factor. Plex Media Server runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD. Pre-Built Plex Server If you’re opting for a pre-built system, you really don’t need a fancy machine. Don’t be tempted by a gaming PC, as that’s plain overkill. Unless you plan on running your Plex server off of a machine that doubles as your primary computer, you can snag something much more affordable. Mac Mini ($690/£500) Ads by Google The Mac Mini consistently ranks as one of the most popular devices for a Plex server. Notably, it’s also a top pick as a Plex client. Mac World has a great write up on using the Mac Mini as a Plex server. While the Mac Mini does have a higher starting price, its small footprint and stellar specs make it a great choice. The i5 clocks in around $700 with 8 GB of memory and a 1 TB hard drive. For power users, the 1 TB of storage may be skimpy, but higher configurations are available. However, a cheaper solution for adding more storage space to a Mac Mini is simply getting a high-capacity external hard drive. The i5 reportedly carries a PassMark just under 4,000 while the i7 configuration has a 5204 PassMark. An i5 Mac Mini should be fine for one 1080p stream and a 720p, and the i5 should handle two 1080p streams. Although the Mac Mini might not be the most powerful pre-built machine for the price, it makes a solid Plex server. Its small form factor means the Mac Mini may double as a home theater PC (HTPC). Plus, Macs tend to benefit from a long life span anecdotally speaking. Even the 2015 Mac World write up used a 2011 Mac Mini and found it perfectly suitable. So longevity, form factor, and little set up posit the Mac Mini as a top pre-built solution for a Plex server. Pros Long life span. i5 or i7 available. Up to 2 TB. Little to no configuration required. Doubles as an HTPC. Cons Cheaper options available. Limited storage options for power users. No optical drive. System76 Meerkat (Starting at $480) The System76 Meerkat is a neat little device. It’s a Linux PC that’s ready to use out-of-the-box. The Meerkat comes with an Intel Core i3 or i5 and up to 2.5 TB of storage space. What makes it an excellent Plex server is its 4″ footprint and energy efficiency. Thus, the System76 Meerkat provides a great option for a Plex server that won’t jack up your power bill if you have an always-on system. However, the Meerkat isn’t exactly cheap. It starts at $449. I recommend the i5 if you’ll have multiple transcoded streams running. The i3 offers a 3,915 PassMark score and stepping up to the i5  raises it to 4,330. If you have a massive media collection, you’ll want to max out the storage which will further drive up the final price. But it’s easily upgradeable and a quality device that comes preloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 16.10. System76 also makes a variety of laptops and desktops Three Awesome Linux Laptops You Can Buy Right Now Three Awesome Linux Laptops You Can Buy Right Now Linux is amazing, unless it won't install. Then it just hurts. Fortunately, a number of laptop makers build Linux laptops that don't suffer from any driver or software faults. Read More that run Linux out of the box. Pros Tiny footprint. Doubles as an HTPC. Lots of configuration options. Out-of-the-box Linux solution. Easily upgradeable. Cons Pricey with options. No optical drive. HP Wave (Starting at $530) The HP Wave is not only a rather beefy PC, it comes in a small, visually pleasing package. PCWorld dubbed the HP Wave “pretty and powerful.” It’s also an excellent Plex server with this combination. There’s even a speaker built in, though audiophiles will benefit from a separate set up. Lots of configuration options offer a tailored PC experience. CPU choices range from an i3 to i7. There’s up to 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage options go up to 2 TB for standard hard drives and there are even SSD options. Its graphics hardware won’t top benchmarks in The Witcher 3 or Titanfall, but the HP Wave boasts support for up to two 4K displays with either the Intel HD 530 or optional AMD R9 M470. Unfortunately, the graphics aren’t upgradeable. In fact, the Wave is not very expandable so this may be a downfall for power users. But for those who want an aesthetically pleasing, powerful, and flexible PC as a Plex server, the HP Wave is perfect. Pros Aesthetically pleasing. Powerful. Lots of configuration options. Small footprint. Good GPU. Cons Not easily upgradeable. DIY Plex Server You can easily make your own server. There are nearly limitless options, but the main factors you’ll want to prioritize are CPU performance (PassMark rating), size, and energy efficiency. Though AMD typically offers a better price to performance ratio, its lower PassMark scores mean Intel is likely the better choice. If you’re going the DIY route, you may want to consider a Linux distro as your operating system since it’s free and helps to cut down on the overall cost. Raspberry Pi ($60) Oh, the Raspberry Pi. Arguably the most utilitarian and functional product ever made, a Raspberry Pi is capable of performing the functions of both Plex server and client 3 Ways to Set Up Your Raspberry Pi as a Media Server 3 Ways to Set Up Your Raspberry Pi as a Media Server Which media center application should you install on your Raspberry Pi? Several options are on offer, and we're going to walk you through them now, looking at the features, advantages, and disadvantages of each. Read More . Most use the Pi as a client. However, RasPlex or Kodi plugins can turn the Pi into a cheap Plex server solution. Check out Element 14 for a spectacular write-up on running a Plex server off of a Raspberry Pi. For this solution, I recommend the Raspberry Pi 3 as it’s currently the most powerful Pi board available. However, you can probably guess that transcoding will be poor. The Pi 3, equipped with its quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 simply isn’t up to heavy or even moderate 1080p transcodes. But for a cheap Plex server, the Pi can’t be beaten. It’s likely the most inexpensive option aside from re-purposing hardware you’ve got lying around. Pros Inexpensive. Easy to set up. Energy efficient. Small footprint. Cons Under-powered for transcoding. Intel NUC ($125/£120) The Intel NUC line is excellent as an HTPC and a Plex server. htpcBeginner published a fantastic write-up on why you should use an Intel NUC as a home theater PC. For a bit more info on what a NUC is and why you would want one, check out our awesome breakdown What's a NUC and Why Would You Want One? What's a NUC and Why Would You Want One? NUCs can best be described as barebones, small form-factor PCs -- and they're pretty awesome under the right circumstances. Read More . The same logic follows for a Plex server. They are quiet, utilitarian, and well priced. There’s even a Reddit Plex thread on using a NUC as a server. An i7 costs around $450 and can handle two to three simultaneous 1080p transcodes. The Skylake i5 can handle about two, with the Skylake i3 capable of running one or two. On the low end, a Broadwell i3 can take a single 1080p transcode. Energy savings and small footprint make the Intel NUC a winner. Unfortunately, while RAM and hard drives are upgradeable, the CPU and GPU are not. GPU performance isn’t as essential, but since the CPU is the biggest factor in transcoding and streaming, this could be a downfall for some users. Still, it’s an inexpensive device and offers excellent specs for a Plex server. Alternately, go with the high-end line (UK) of NUC for even more power. But be forewarned these only take m.2 SSDs so you’ll pay a premium for storage. Pros Small footprint. Energy efficient. Range of CPU options. RAM and hard drives upgradeable. Cons CPU and GPU not upgradeable. Requires m.2 SSDs. Gigabyte BRIX ($500/£880) Gigabyte’s brand is synonymous with awesome mini PCs. The BRIX line provides a smattering of options. But for a Plex server, a Gigabyte BRIX equipped with an i5 or i7 is your best bet. The GB-BXi7-5775 features an i7 CPU and Iris Pro 6200 integrated graphics that are capable of pumping 4K video. The BRIX supports an mSATA SSD and traditional 2.5″ laptop hard drive. Plus, it’s compact and may even be mounted to a monitor. The BRIX is a stellar PC for either an out of the way Plex server or HTPC. Even so, it suffers from minor drawbacks. The CPU and GPU are non-upgradeable. However, small size mixed with the powerful i7 help this ultra compact PC overcome any potential downfalls. Notably, the i5 variations are still awesome choices and save a bit of cash at the expense of a slightly lower PassMark score. Pros Small footprint. Powerful Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Up to an i7 processor. Cons Nonupgradeable CPU and GPU. i7 is pricey. ThinkServer TS140 ($220) The ThinkServer TS140 is marketed as a server, but it’s essentially a desktop. IBM’s hefty ThinkServer is a powerful and capable potential Plex server. Outfitted with either an i3 or a Xeon CPU, it’s a fantastic solution that consistently gets plugged in Plex communities like this Reddit thread. And this one too. The i3 boasts a PassMark score of 4,764 whereas the Xeon ThinkServer TS140 clocks in at 7,042. The base model Core i3 can, therefore, handle two 1080p streams while the Xenon can tackle almost four. Yet the ThinkServer TS140 does not include an operating system or hard drive. You’ll need to supply those yourself. Additionally, the TS140 has VGA out, lacking DVI, HDMI, or Displayport. You may add a graphics card which alleviates this potential nuisance. But especially if you plan to run a headless server, this should not present a problem. Pros Excellent PassMark score. Just add an operating system and hard drive. Can handle almost four 1080p streams (Xeon). Good overall value. Cons No hard drive. No operating system. Large footprint. NAS Plex Server While lots of users employ a desktop or laptop as a Plex server, Network Attached Storage (NAS) are perfectly suitable. Opting for a NAS-based Plex server affords loads of storage at a lower price. However, the tradeoff comes at computing power. Usually, NAS devices have low-power. While this is excellent for power-saving if you’ve got an always-on Plex server, a NAS Plex server may struggle with transcoding. There’s a useful compatibility doc that gives a detailed spec breakdown. Not convinced you need a NAS? Here are seven reasons 7 Reasons to Use a NAS for Data Storage & Backups 7 Reasons to Use a NAS for Data Storage & Backups External hard drives are great for data storage, but there are many more benefits to using a network-attached drive instead. Here's everything you need to know. Read More to use a NAS for data storage and backups. Western Digital My Passport Wireless Pro ($250/£196 for 2 TB) Western Digital remains at the forefront of storage with consistently high-performing hardware. The My Passport Wireless Pro is a breakthrough. The ready-made Plex server is the first NAS that’s Plex ready from the get go. It’s even battery-powered making it a portable solution. PC World dubbed the My Passport Wireless Pro the equivalent of a “self-contained Netflix.” Yet this newfound freedom doesn’t come cheap. The 2 TB iteration retails for $230, while the 3 TB version is $250 at regular price. Sure, that’s quite a lot of storage, but the My Passport Pro is unable to transcode on-the-fly. Thus, you may need to convert media to properly ensure that your Plex client is able to stream your content. However, this is a common downfall of NAS-based Plex servers, and if you’re going the NAS route the WD My Passport Wireless Pro is absolutely your best bet. Pros Wireless built-in. Battery-powered. Ready-to-go Plex server. Cons No on-the-fly transcoding. Pricey. Synology DS-216+ ($300/£220) The Synology DS-216+ lends itself well for use as a Plex server. 9to5Mac even reviewed the Synology as a Plex server with glowing feedback. Synology makes Plex available as an app for the DS-216+ and it’s just like downloading an app on your iPhone or Android. Since set up is pretty simple this could be a great option. As long as you don’t have to transcode much. If you do, you may find the Synology a bit under-powered. Pros Energy efficient. Lots of storage options. Easy Plex install. Cons Under-powered for transcoding. Expensive. QNAP TS-x53A  ($580/£395) and TVS-x71 ($950/£1179) QNAP offers a solid NAS that’s Plex server ready. A neat feature, QNAP includes the QvPC feature that allows a NAS so serve as an HTPC. Flaunting HDMI out and decent processors, QNAP produces some of the best NAS Plex solutions available. The TVS-x71 series is available with up to an i7, 16 GB of RAM, and four to eight hard drive bays. It’s got an HDMI out and can handle 720p and 1080p transcodes. The TVS-x71 features a maximum capacity of 64 TB. The mid-range TS-x53A features Intel Braswell Celeron quad-core processors. Its 8 GB of RAM, up to eight hard drive bays, and two HDMI outputs shape this QNAP NAS as a viable Plex server. However, the Celeron processor may not handle larger 1080p transcodes very well. But it’s available for less money and should address the average user’s needs. Pros NAS can act as a PC/HTPC. HDMI out. Lots of storage and configuration options. Cons Slower transcodes with TS-x53A. CPU not upgradable. Final Thoughts: What’s the Best Plex Server? Setting up an awesome Plex server for your multimedia needs is a lot easier than you think. Chances are you may have an old desktop or laptop lying around that’s suitable as a Plex server. However, buying or building a PC or NAS offers the convenience of a separate device than your daily driver. Regardless of your decision, you’re probably better opting for an Intel CPU (sorry AMD) because of transcoding and power efficiency. But for AMD fans, there are options for pretty cost-efficient and energy-saving builds like this one Build a Leaner, Greener, Meaner HTPC with AMD's New AM1 Platform Build a Leaner, Greener, Meaner HTPC with AMD's New AM1 Platform This article covers the various components, with suggestions, for building an AM1-based media center or office productivity desktop.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Industry News 2 Intel seeks to adapt silicon transistors to quantum computing by Mark Tyson on 22 December 2016, 12:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcji Add to My Vault: While computing rivals such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google are looking at completely new technologies from which to develop quantum components, Intel is seeking to adapt silicon transistors for the task in hand. As the MIT Technology Review reports, Intel engineers in Portland, Oregon, and researchers in the TU Delft's QuTech quantum research institute in Holland, are working together to adapt Intel's silicon based technologies and manufacturing for quantum computing. A $50 million grant was established last year to provide funds for these research activities. Last month Intel engineers asserted that they "can now layer the ultra-pure silicon needed for a quantum computer onto the standard wafers used in chip factories," wrote Technology Review bureau chief, Tom Simonite. Now it seems that Intel is in one way more advanced than its competitors and yet in another way it is behind. In its favour it has the expertise and equipment used to make conventional chips with billions of identical transistors - required for any kind of broadly useful computation power. Furthermore, it has just achieved the above milestone of ultra-pure silicon layering. On the negative side for Intel, its rivals can already run code on prototype chips with several qubits. Silicon qubits can't be demonstrated right now but they are likely to get to that point, says Jim Clarke, Intel's director of quantum hardware for this collaborative project. "The hope is that if we make the best transistors, then with a few material and design changes we can make the best qubits," said Clarke, summing up the impetus behind the research project.

Parents of Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan speak out about new video by Diana Mehta, The Canadian Press Posted Dec 22, 2016 9:14 am EST Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 at 10:16 am EST National This undated militant file image from video posted online in August 2016, which has not been independently verified by The Associated Press, provided by SITE Intel Group, shows Canadian Joshua Boyle and American Caitlan Coleman, who were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012. The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they've seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ AP-SITE Intel Group via AP, File The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in 2012 while travelling in a mountainous region of northern Afghanistan. In a video uploaded to YouTube earlier this week, Coleman — sitting next to her husband and two young children — urges governments on all sides to reach a deal to secure the family’s freedom. Related stories: Canada calls for release of kidnapped couple in Afghanistan US evaluating Taliban video of captive couple in Afghanistan Videos show Canadian-American couple held in Afghanistan Boyle’s parents, Patrick and Linda Boyle, said they watched the video on Monday, getting their first glimpse at their young grandsons. “It is an indescribable emotional sense one has watching a grandson making faces at the camera, while hearing our son’s leg chains clanging up and down on the floor as he tries to settle his son,” the Boyles said in a written statement. “It is unbelievable that they have had to shield their sons from their horrible reality for four years.” The parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife have tried to protect their children by pretending their signs of captivity are part of a game being played with guards. “It is simply heartbreaking to watch both boys so keenly observing their new surroundings in a makeshift film studio, while listening to their mother describe how they were made to watch her being defiled,” the Boyles said. The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. The group said the video was dated Dec. 3. In the clip, Coleman says her family has been waiting since 2012 for somebody to understand the “Kafkaesque nightmare” they are living. “We understand both sides hate us and are content to leave us and our two surviving children in these problems but we can only ask and pray that somebody will recognize the atrocities these men carry out against us,” she is heard saying. The Boyles said their daughter-in-law could not have used a more accurate term than kafkaesque. “The absence of a clear course of action to escape a complex and bizarre situation that seems it may be somewhere between fiction and reality. Overpowered and constrained by others beyond their control, but striving to break through nonetheless,” the Boyles said. They said the video appears to confirm that those holding their son and family captive “want to bring this to an end soon.” “They prefer to reach an understanding during this brief period of the American presidential transition,” the Boyles said. “It also confirms the seriousness and immediacy of the captors’ threats to our four family members.” The Boyles said they hope all governments involved will bring their son’s case to a safe resolution soon. A spokesman with Global Affairs Canada said the federal government is “deeply concerned” about the safety and well-being of Joshua Boyle and his family and calls for their unconditional release. Coleman’s parents say they are hoping U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will broker her release if President Barack Obama doesn’t succeed before he leaves office. Jim and Lyn Coleman, of Stewartstown, Pa., spoke to ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday, saying they took solace in seeing their daughter and grandkids looking healthy and in seeing the children for the first time. “You just want to reach out, you know, and hold them,” Lyn Coleman said of her grandchildren. “And that’s very difficult.” Joshua Boyle and Coleman vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman’s parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what he described as an “unsafe” part of Afghanistan. In 2013, the couple appeared in two videos asking the U.S. government to free them from the Taliban. Coleman’s parents received a letter last November in which their daughter said she had given birth to a second child in captivity. A video released in August showed Coleman and Boyle warning that their captors would kill them and their children unless the government in Kabul ends its execution of Taliban prisoners.

This chip giant's dividend has a lot of room to grow based on its recent financial performance, but don't expect it all in one shot. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 22, 2016 at 5:01PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) pays a solid dividend of $1.04/share on an annual basis. As of a recent check of the stock price, that works out to around 2.81% yield. Although the company is far from high-yielding in absolute terms, it's solid relative to what its large-cap, dividend-paying semiconductor peers pay. Data source: Google Finance. Intel has generally done a good job of delivering annual dividend increases to its stockholders. There was, however, a 10-quarter stretch between August 2012 and November 2014 during which the company didn't boost its dividend (presumably since Intel's revenues were declining as it boosted operating expenses). The company did return to form in early 2015, raising its quarterly dividend from $0.225/share to a $0.24/share. It raised the dividend again in early 2016 to $0.26 per share. I believe Intel will raise the dividend again to try to further boost the attractiveness of its stock, particularly to more income-oriented investors. Let's look at by how much Intel could reasonably raise its dividend. Dividend is paid from free-cash-flow A key metric to look at when trying to analyze a company's dividend potential is its trailing-12-month free cash flow per share. Dividends are paid from a company's free cash flow, so the more free cash flow a company generates (and can generate on a consistent basis), the more cash it can put into stockholders' pockets. Over the last 12 months, Intel generated $10.54 billion in free cash flow, translating to around $2.163 per share. This is well below Intel's current annual dividend payments of $1.04 per share, suggesting the company has plenty of room to grow the amount it pays out in dividends even if its business stays stagnant. Expect a modest increase It wouldn't be smart for Intel to just jack up its dividend payout to the maximum its trailing-12-month free cash flow could support. Such a move would limit Intel's ability to deliver future increases, especially if it continues to have a tough time growing its top and bottom lines going forward. It's smarter to leave a hefty amount of margin on the table, "just in case." With that in mind, I expect Intel to deliver a modest dividend increase when it announces its financial results in January. A bump from $0.26 per share on a quarterly basis to, say, $0.28 per share would represent a solid raise (roughly 7.7%). Such a dividend raise isn't going to dramatically change the fortunes of current Intel stockholders or be something that will get investors who just don't like the story to finally hop on board. Still, it would be a welcome move. If Intel's business performance dramatically improves, so will the dividend A company's dividend payments and its business performance are very closely tied together. If Intel were to see a substantial and sustainable boost in profitability (say, all of those big investments in R&D that the company is making today pay off in a nice way five years from now), then it could have a lot of room to improve the dividend more dramatically. At the same time, though, if Intel could boost its dividend substantially because of much better business performance, then the stock price would also likely trade quite a lot higher than it does today. In that case, the dividend yield for new buyers of the stock might not be much higher than it is today, but for shareholders who got in earlier, the dividend yield relative to one's initial investment would go up a bunch.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Haswell OpenGL 4.0 / FP64 Support In Mesa Might Finally Be Close To Merging Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 22 December 2016 at 01:00 AM EST. 8 Comments It appears that ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 for Intel Haswell graphics hardware might finally be merged soon into Mesa and thereby exposing OpenGL 4.0 support. While Broadwell and newer Intel hardware has OpenGL 4.5 support in Mesa, the Haswell support is left behind as while it can reach OpenGL ~4.1, it's currently at OpenGL 3.3. The blocking extension from Haswell having OpenGL 4.0 is the big ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 extension, but the code has been sitting around for a while. Back in October Igalia revised their FP64 patches for Haswell, but sadly they've been spending the past few months basically sitting idle on the mailing list. Fortunately, it looks like Intel developers are finally moving forward with reviewing the massive patch-set and things are looking good. This week Matt Turner commented on the series and gives his "reviewed-by" to the work. And he commented, "Again, thank you so much. This was a large amount of work, and the way you guys handled it was extremely impressive. I'm only sorry that the review of your work wasn't executed as well as your actual work!" Hopefully these patches will finally land soon (perhaps a Christmas present?), albeit GL4 isn't the most necessary for Haswell owners especially considering the slow graphics performance for most of these older chips. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Join For Free Evolve your approach to Application Performance Monitoring by adopting five best practices that are outlined and explored in this e-book, brought to you in partnership with BMC. Continuing on with the series, I plan to highlight a few concrete examples that illustrate why I think it’s not only useful but crucial for the health of the JavaScript community to stop paying attention to static peak performance benchmarks above a certain threshold. Last post, we talked about the notorious SunSpider examples, this post we'll go into detail about the Kraken benchmark. The Not-So-Obvious Kraken Case The Kraken benchmark was released by Mozilla in September 2010. It was said to contain snippets and kernels of real-world applications and be less of a micro-benchmark compared to SunSpider. I don’t want to spend too much time on Kraken because I think it wasn’t as influential on JavaScript performance as SunSpider and Octane, so I’ll highlight one particular example from the audio-oscillator.js test. So, the test invokes the calcOsc function 500 times. calcOsc first calls generate on the global sineOscillator, then creates a new Oscillator, calls generate on that, and adds it to the global sine oscillator. Without going into detail as to why the test is doing this, let’s have a look at the generate method on the Oscillator prototype. Looking at the code, you’d expect this to be dominated by the array accesses or the multiplications or the Math.round calls in the loop, but surprisingly, what’s completely dominating the runtime of Oscillator.prototype.generate is the offset % this.waveTableLength expression. Running this benchmark in a profiler on any Intel machine reveals that more than 20% of the ticks are attributed to the idiv instruction that we generate for the modulus. One interesting observation, however, is that the waveTableLength field of the Oscillator instances always contains the same value 2048, as it’s only assigned once in the Oscillator constructor. If we know that the right hand side of an integer modulus operation is a power of two, we can generate way better code obviously and completely avoid the idiv instruction on Intel. So, what we needed was a way to get the information that this.waveTableLength is always 2048 from the Oscillator constructor to the modulus operation in Oscillator.prototype.generate. One obvious way would be to try to rely on inlining of everything into the calcOsc function and let load/store elimination do the constant propagation for us, but this would not work for the sine oscillator, which is allocated outside the calcOsc function. So, what we did instead was add support for tracking certain constant values as right-hand side feedback for the modulus operator. This does make some sense in V8 since we track type feedback for binary operations like +, * and % on uses, which means the operator tracks the types of inputs it has seen and the types of outputs that were produced (see the slides from the roundtable talk on Fast arithmetic for dynamic languages recently for some details). Hooking this up with fullcodegen and Crankshaft was even fairly easy back then. The BinaryOpIC for MOD can also track known power of two right hand sides. In fact, running the default configuration of V8 (with Crankshaft and fullcodegen): $ ~/Projects/v8/out/Release/d8 --trace-ic audio-oscillator.js
[...SNIP...]
[BinaryOpIC(MOD:None*None->None) => (MOD:Smi*2048->Smi) @ ~Oscillator.generate+598 at audio-oscillator.js:697]
[...SNIP...]
$ ...shows that the BinaryOpIC is picking up the proper constant feedback for the right-hand side of the modulus and properly tracks that the left-hand side was always a small integer (a Smi in V8 speak), and we also always produced a small integer result. Looking at the generated code using --print-opt-code --code-comments quickly reveals that Crankshaft utilizes the feedback to generate an efficient code sequence for the integer modulus in Oscillator.prototype.generate: [...SNIP...]

0x133a0bdacd57   599  e81273cdff     call 0x133a0ba8406e
[...SNIP...] So, you see we load the value of this.waveTableLength (rbx holds the this reference), check that it’s still 2048 (hexadecimal 0x800), and if so, just perform a bitwise and with the proper bitmask 0x7ff (r11 contains the value of the loop induction variable i) instead of using the idiv instruction (paying proper attention to preserve the sign of the left hand side). The Over-Specialization Issue So, this trick is pretty damn cool, but as with many benchmark-focused tricks, it has one major drawback: it’s overspecialized! As soon as the right hand side changes, all optimized code will have to be deoptimized (as the assumption that the right hand is always a certain power of two no longer holds) and any further optimization attempts will have to use idiv again, as the BinaryOpIC will most likely report feedback in the form Smi*Smi->Smi then. For example, let’s assume we instantiate another Oscillator, set a differentwaveTableLength on it, and call generate for the oscillator. We’d lose 20% performance even though the actually interesting Oscillators are not affected (i.e., the engine does non-local penalization here). --- audio-oscillator.js.ORIG    2016-12-15 22:01:43.897033156 +0100

$ This is an example for a pretty terrible performance cliff. Let’s say a developer writes code for a library and does careful tweaking and optimizations using certain sample input values, and the performance is decent. Now a user starts using that library reading through the performance notes, but somehow falls off the performance cliff, because she/he is using the library in a slightly different way (i.e., somehow polluting type feedback for a certain BinaryOpIC,) and is hit by a 20% slowdown (compared to the measurements of the library author) that neither the library author nor the user can explain, and that seems rather arbitrary. Now, this is not uncommon in JavaScript land, and unfortunately, quite a couple of these cliffs are just unavoidable, because they are due to the fact that JavaScript performance is based on optimistic assumptions and speculation. We have been spending a lot of time and energy trying to come up with ways to avoid these performance cliffs, and still provide (nearly) the same performance. As it turns out, it makes a lot of sense to avoid idiv whenever possible even if you don’t necessarily know that the right-hand side is always a power of two (via dynamic feedback). What TurboFan does is different from Crankshaft in that it always checks at runtime whether the input is a power of two, so a general case for signed integer modulus with optimization for an unknown power of two right-hand side looks like this (in pseudo-code): if 0 < rhs then
  msk = rhs - 1
  if rhs & msk != 0 then
    lhs % rhs
  else
    if lhs < 0 then
      -(-lhs & msk)
    else
      lhs & msk
else
  if rhs < -1 then
    lhs % rhs
  else
    zero That leads to a lot more consistent and predictable performance (with TurboFan): $ ~/Projects/v8/out/Release/d8 --turbo audio-oscillator.js.ORIG
Time (audio-oscillator-once): 69 ms.
$ ~/Projects/v8/out/Release/d8 --turbo audio-oscillator.js
Time (audio-oscillator-once): 69 ms.
$ The problem with benchmarks and overspecialization is that the benchmark can give you hints where to look and what to do, but it doesn’t tell you how far you have to go and doesn’t protect the optimization properly. For example, all JavaScript engines use benchmarks as a way to guard against performance regressions, but running Kraken, for example, wouldn’t protect the general approach that we have in TurboFan, i.e., we could degrade the modulus optimization in TurboFan to the over-specialized version of Crankshaft and the benchmark wouldn’t tell us that we regressed, because from the point of view of the benchmark it’s fine! Now, you could extend the benchmark, maybe in the same way that I did above and try to cover everything with benchmarks, which is what engine implementors do to a certain extent. However, that approach doesn’t scale arbitrarily. Even though benchmarks are convenient and easy to use for communication and competition, you’ll also need to leave space for common sense, otherwise over-specialization will dominate everything and you’ll have a really, really fine line of acceptable performance and big performance cliffs. There are various other issues with the Kraken tests. Next time, we'll look at what is probably the most influential JavaScript benchmark of the last five years: the Octane benchmark.

The reason why is simple: Renewable energy produces little or no greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity production is over a third of U.S. GHG emissions, and the majority of those emissions are caused by coal-fired power plants, which produce about 25 percent of the nation’s emissions. While coal emits between 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (C02E/kWh), wind emits just 0.02 to 0.04 pounds of C02E/kWh and solar only 0.07 to 0.20. The Environmental Protection Agency launched the Green Power Partnership (GPP) in 2001 to increase the use of renewable energy among American companies. It a voluntary program which encourages organizations to use renewables. The GPP produces a National Top 100 list of the largest renewable energy users within its participants. And the combined renewable energy use of the top 100 partners is almost 30 billion kilowatt-hours a year, representing over 83 percent of the renewable energy commitments made by all GPP partners. America’s top five renewable energy companies Looking at the top five companies on the GPP’s National Top 100 list proves the U.S. can widely adopt renewable energy. And it shows that business can continue to lead the way in renewable energy use regardless of who is in the White House. 1. Intel  The tech company that bills itself as the world leader in silicon innovation is in the GPP’s top spot for the eighth consecutive year. The company buys over 3.4 billion kWh a year of renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated from wind, solar, geothermal, low-impact hydropower and biomass projects from third-party certified sources. The company’s REC purchases are equivalent of removing over 455,000 cars from the road every year, or avoiding the amount of electricity needed to power over 327,000 average American homes annually. Intel also has 58 wind micro-turbines perched on top of its worldwide headquarters in Santa Clara, California. It is one of the largest operating rooftop wind micro-turbine arrays in the world. Each of the turbines is between six and seven feet tall, weighing about 30 pounds. Each micro-turbine can produce about 65 kWh of power a year. 2. Microsoft  One of the largest technology and software companies in the country, Microsoft purchased over 1.3 billion kWh of renewable energy annually in recent years. As a result of its use of renewables, combined with energy-efficiency measures and investments in carbon-reduction projects, the company met its goal to reduce carbon emissions by at least 30 percent per unit of revenue below a 2007 baseline. Microsoft has been 100 percent powered by renewable energy through its REC purchases, power purchase agreements (PPAs) and on-site energy since 2014. Here are some highlights of Microsoft’s use of renewables: In 2013, the company signed a 20-year agreement to buy 100 percent of the output of the Keechi Wind project, a 110-megawatt wind farm in Keechi, Texas. In 2014, the company bought 175 MW of wind energy from the Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois. The project generates more than enough electricity to power its Chicago data center and 70,000 Illinois houses. Microsoft installed a rooftop solar array at its Silicon Valley campus in 2006, which generates 480 kilowatts at peak capacity. 3. Kohl’s department stores The company with over 1,160 department stores in 49 states entered select stores into a PPA with SunEdison for a 20-year term in 2007. As a result, the solar power systems provide about 40 percent of each store’s power. As of December 2015, the company had 163 solar power systems in 15 states. The largest solar panel system is installed at its E-Fulfillment Center 3 in Edgewood, Maryland. It features 8,360 solar panels which generate over 3 kWh of energy a year, enough to supply 317 homes annually. Kohl’s also invests in wind power. In 2011, it installed wind turbines on two locations. One of those was at its distribution center in Findlay, Ohio, where wind turbines generate 40,000 kWh a year. 4. Cisco Systems Cisco purchased over 1.2 billion kWh of renewables globally in 2016, which represent about 100 percent of its total U.S. electricity use. Cisco achieved the milestone through on-site renewable power, green power contracts with utilities, offsite power opportunities, and RECs. From 2012 to 2016, the company increased its total on-site solar photovoltaic (PC) capacity from 200 KW to 2.7 MW. And those solar power systems produce on average 1.7 million kWh of power, which avoid over 1,200 metric ton of carbon equivalent annually over the projected 25-year life of the systems. 5. Google  As of April 2016, Google signed 15 long-term agreements for over 2,000 MW of wind and solar energy, which is enough to power about 670,000 homes. The company has committed almost $2.5 billion to renewable energy projects, representing a total capacity of over 3.7 gigawatts. That’s enough to power 1 million homes. And Google uses renewable energy to power over 35 percent of its operations.

"For security, [we] have to deploy [THAAD]… As we cannot wait even for a moment to cope with North Korea's nuclear provocations, we have to do what we can do first," Hwang said during a parliamentary session, as quoted by the Yonhap news agency. Hwang's proposal comes amid calls from opposition parties to delay the deployment, scheduled for May 2017, and strong objections from China. In July, Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy the THAAD system in South Korea's Seongju County amid growing tensions spurred by North Korea's ballistic and nuclear tests. The THAAD system is designed to intercept short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at the terminal incoming stage. The move has been criticized by neighboring China and Russia as inappropriate, possibly disproportionate and affecting other countries' interests.

The news was posted on Twitter by WABetaInfo, which reveals that Whatsapp are working on the new function as part of the iOS 2.17.1.869 update. Basically, users will be given the option to click "revoke" on a message once it has already been sent. However at this stage it is still unclear if it will be possible to delete the message once it has been read, which is when two blue ticks appear or while the message is in the delivery stage (two grey ticks).

There is still no confirmation on the date of the launch of this new function, however the news that it is on its way is already lifting spirits. The feature is currently being trialed in the app's iPhone beta version. In addition to these changes, users who send messages that end up being quoted can also rest easy, as an error will appear saying that the sender revoked the message.  @RegsterU pic.twitter.com/qXgBFl919s — WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) 15 December 2016 ​WhatsApp launched in 2009 and has enjoyed a huge amount of success.

Based in Unterschleissheim near Munich, the new campus will be home to 2000 experts working on every aspect from software development to real-world testing. But the decision to create a base of operations in Munich is also an attempt to ensure Europe is firmly on the map as a hotspot for next-generation automotive technology development. “The road to fully-automated driving is an opportunity for Germany's automobile manufacturing base. The decision to develop and road-test these vehicles in the Munich area illustrates how the BMW Group and the whole region can benefit from this shift in the automotive industry,” said Klaus Fröhlich, member of the Board of Management, responsible for Development at the BMW Group. Detroit and Silicon Valley are also trying to establish themselves as the de facto home of the car of the future so it makes sense that European carmakers, whose legacy stretches back 130 years, would want to court and keep the world's leading experts within their own continental borders. However, in a fully connected world, it is impossible for any single company to work in isolation. In order for BMW to bring the iNEXT ― the name it has given its self-driving car ― to fruition on schedule, it has already forged a long-term partnership with US firms Intel and MobilEye. Intel's role in the alliance is to develop in-car processors and to help crunch through the huge amounts of data the project will create. “Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents,” explained Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. MobilEye's expertise is in sensing and localization, and its partnership with BMW is one of several it has announced in recent months. For instance, at the 2017 CES in January, MobilEye will be demonstrating the fruits of its partnership with autonomous driving tech company Delphi over a specially created real-world course in Las Vegas. The companies claim the system, called the Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (CSLP) automated driving system, is the most advanced autonomous driving system currently in existence. As for the partnership with BMW, officially announced in July, the companies are already on target to start testing a prototype autonomous vehicle fleet in urban conditions in early 2017. “[This] future development site for autonomous driving will enable us to launch the BMW iNEXT, the first self-driving BMW, onto the market in 2021,” said Fröhlich. ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Tan Chong offers seven-year warranty for Nissan owners SKYACTIV ‘Jinba Ittai’ — being at one with your Mazda (VIDEO) CES 2017: A multitude of electric, connected and driverless concept cars After half century, Volvo overtaken in Sweden What to expect for the auto industry in 2017 (VIDEO) Japan unveils all-new 2017 Suzuki Swift Best car engine innovations of 2016 S.

Chana and Miriam, who preferred not to reveal their surnames, studied computer engineering at a Haredi college and are now working in a startup set up by Ruth Margalit, the ultra-Orthodox CEO of Bnei Brak-based I-rox, a software company that outsources services to firms. Miriam started working there five months ago, and unlike most of the women on the bus, she is not wearing a wig or other head-covering, indicating she is not yet married. “My parents are in favor of me working,” she said. “They want us to do what we love.” When asked about her prospects for shidduchim, or arranged dates for the purpose of marriage, she said with a smile, “Be’ezrat Hashem — with God’s help — in another year or two we will go on shidduchim.” KamaTech’s bus load of Haredi women in meeting with Cisco’s Zika Abzuk in Jerusalem (Courtesy: Natalie Schor) “Shidduchim are not relevant to this article,” interjected Chana, rightly outraged by the question. “If we study, we progress.” Both Miriam and Chana expressed aggravation at what they say is a “stigma” carried by ultra-Orthodox women, who are seen in Israeli society as subjugated and surrounded by multitudes of children. “We are on this trip to learn and see how work is done” at big tech companies, Chana said. The trip was organized by KamaTech, a nonprofit organization and startup accelerator for ultra-Orthodox entrepreneurs that aims to integrate ultra-Orthodox men and women into Israel’s high-tech industry. Chana and Miriam represent a growing trend among ultra-Orthodox women who are learning skills to take up posts in tech companies. Every year over 600 ultra-Orthodox women graduate from engineering and programming courses in the Haredi seminars. Women constitute around 50 percent of the 6,000 qualified ultra-Orthodox men and women in KamaTech’s database who are looking for jobs in the field. And while in 2013, when KamaTech was founded, there were just 5 ultra-Orthodox entrepreneurs in its databse, today there are some 500, 200 of whom are women, said Moshe Friedman, the co-founder of KamaTech. KamaTech’s bus load of Haredi women visit high tech offices in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Courtesy: Natalie Schor) Israel is looking to tap into new sources of workers as a lack of skilled employees is hampering growth of its high-tech sector, until recently the growth engine of the economy. Tapping into the ultra-Orthodox and Arab populations, which have been left on the sidelines of the high-tech boom because of their lack of relevant training, is one way Israel is looking to overcome its shortfall or skilled employees. “We want these women to meet with women entrepreneurs and see them as role models,” Friedman said in an interview with The Times of Israel. “We want to teach them what a startup is, what a VC is, what the chief scientist does. The idea is to show them different parts of the high-tech puzzle and inspire them to get ideas and dreams.” The average salary in Israel is NIS 9,032 a month ($2,350), and the average salary of women in Israel is NIS 8,173. But the average salary of Haredi women in Israel is NIS 5,284, according to Ministry of Economy and Industry data. Today ultra-Orthodox men and women who work in high-tech are employed at the lowest levels, said Friedman. “We want to bring them to a high level, we want to help them rise, through inspiration and mentoring.” KamaTech’s bus load of Haredi women visit high tech offices in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Courtesy: Natalie Schor) To date KamaTech has managed to place some 400 women in higher-ranking jobs at multinationals like Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Amdocs, Friedman said, with some salaries reaching as high as NIS 14,000. In the two-day bus tour, the women, mostly clad in skirts, headscarves or wigs as is traditional for the sector, went from office to office to meet with some of Israel’s most successful entrepreneurs. These included Zika Abzuk, senior manager, business development at Cisco in Israel and Yael Villa, Cisco’s Jerusalem site manager; Inbal Arieli, vice president, strategic partnerships at Start-up Nation Central and founder of the accelerator 8200 EISP; Michal Waltner, Campus Tel Aviv Program Manager at Google; Yifat Oron, the CEO of LeumiTech, Leumi Group’s high tech subsidiary; Liat Aaronson, a partner at Marker LLC fund who set up the Zell Entrepreneurship Program at IDC Herzliya; and Esther Barak Landes, the CEO of Nielsen Innovate. Some spoke about the difficulties of being a woman in a generally male-dominated workplace; all showed willingness to mentor other women, in a sort of a high-tech sisterhood. In addition, they said, a heterogeneous workplace, with employees from many sectors of society in the high-tech world, was key to success as it contributes to the diversity of products companies strive to offer their users. “Israel has reached a glass ceiling with regard to workers in high-tech. There is not enough supply of workers,” LeumiTech’s Oron said in an interview. “All the good employees are getting hired by the multinationals. It is a competitive market which is good for the workers but not good for the industry. To get new sources we need to reach out to new talent, go to new untapped environments.” LeumiTech partnered in the bus event with KamaTech. There are difficulties however, Oron said, as ultra-Orthodox women are less likely to work in environments that are not religious, feel more comfortable in a women-only surrounding and have special kosher dietary requirements. The idea is to help them find the right conditions that would enable them to work at large multinationals and encourage them to become entrepreneurs. Michal Waltner, Campus Tel Aviv Program Manager at Google, addresses KamaTech’s bus load of woman entrepreneurs (Courtesy: Natalie Schor) “Many come from a very different world,” said Oron. “This bus tour is to get them familiar with the ecosystem.” Heni, a 29-year old ultra-Orthodox entrepreneur who has four children, is setting up a studio to design websites for small and medium-sized businesses after having been employed in the field for seven years as a salaried worker. “It was important for me” to come on the bus tour, she said, standing in line for the elevators at the Google offices in Tel Aviv. “I want to see the startup world, learn what I can and try to get partnerships.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Kamatech,  Ultra-orthodox women,  Ultra-orthodox,  Moshe Friedman,  Ifat Oron,  LeumiTech More in Israel Inside Israeli high-tech exits plunge 67% in 2016 - PwC Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Israel’s Behalf uses algorithms to vet for credit By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli biotechnology startup Nurami Medical raises NIS 2.5m By Luke Tress   US-Israel citizens in a tizz over new kids’ savings plan By Shoshanna Solomon   ‘Virtual breathalyzer’ lets you check if you’re over the limit By Times of Israel staff   Israel M&A activity surged 34% to $16.8b in 2016 — PwC By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs January 2, 2017, 12:38 pm Israel Up and Down Two pieces of economic news came out of Israel recently showing both the ups and downs of......

Photo: Cho Yi-chun, Taipei Times PC maker Asustek Computer Inc (華碩) yesterday said its first voice-controlled robot, Zenbo, would be available for preorder in the consumer market on Jan. 1, meeting the company’s milestone to officially introduce the product. The announcement came more than six months after Asustek chairman Jonney Shih (施崇棠) unveiled the robot at a news conference ahead of Computex Taipei in May. However, Zenbo’s release date is slightly later than Shih’s promise to shareholders in June to introduce it to the market before Christmas, in a bid to contribute growth momentum to the company’s operations in the second half of the year. “It took time to ensure that Zenbo is ready to be a home companion for Taiwanese consumers,” Asustek spokesman Nick Wu (吳長榮) told reporters after the product’s launch event. Asustek continues to invite software and hardware developers to enrich content for Zenbo, he added. The first batch of 168 Zenbos is to be available for preorder via Asustek’s Web site, priced between NT$19,900 and NT$24,900, Wu said, but added that a shipment date has not yet been confirmed. Zenbo, which is powered by Intel Corp’s RealSense human-computer interaction technology, is to initially be focused on providing education and entertainment content, as well as home security functions, Wu said. Asustek has inked an agreement with Benesse Corp to develop interactive educational games based on the Japanese company’s famous cartoon character Shimajiro, due to the character’s high popularity among children in Taiwan, he said. Collaboration with the National Police Agency allows Zenbo to report to police via videoconferencing if there is an emergency situation in a home, Wu said, adding that Zenbo can also help users reserve rides through Taiwan Taxi Corp (台灣大車隊) and connect to PChome Online Inc’s (網路家庭) Web site for shopping. Asked if the company still plans to launch Zenbo in China next quarter and in the US in the second quarter of next year, Wu said Asustek plans to focus on its home market and would expand the robot’s sales when the firm is ready. The sales contribution from Zenbo to Asustek will be limited at launch in Taiwan, but is expected to gradually increase as the firm begins mass production of the robot in the first half of next year, Wu said. Asustek shares yesterday remained unchanged at NT$263.5 in Taipei trading, while the TAIEX dropped 0.41 percent. This story has been viewed 2645 times. Comments will be moderated.

Even the experts say that visual content, including video, will go big in the coming year. According to Think with Google: “When it comes to online video, one word summarizes the trends in consumer behavior: ‘more.’ […] consumers are spending more time on more devices with more focus and passion for online video than ever.” So now would be the perfect time to add video to your content and search marketing strategy. But what’s the best platform to publish videos? Look no further because we’ve got answers here! According to a survey sent out to Search Engine Journal’s Twitter audience, 85% of respondents publish their videos on YouTube, 11% publish on Facebook, 4% publish elsewhere, and none publish on Vimeo.

Let’s get the low-down on these video sites and how you can use them to boost your marketing efforts.

Home Industry Technology Asus Transformer Pro3: Delivers on performance but the battery is a letdown Asus Transformer Pro3: Delivers on performance but the battery is a letdown Microsoft and Intel have been pushing for the world to move towards 2-in-1 convertibles for quite some years now. But it is only with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that this segment has come to near perfection, with Windows 10 running. By: Shruti Dhapola | Updated: December 22, 2016 7:27 AM Asus Transformer Pro 3. Microsoft and Intel have been pushing for the world to move towards 2-in-1 convertibles for quite some years now. But it is only with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that this segment has come to near perfection, with Windows 10 running. Of course, for those who are comfortable with the iOS universe, the 12-inch iPad Pro is an option, and a powerful one at that; there’s the smaller 9-inch iPad Pro as well. However, there are other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Asus, Huawei and Acer, too, vying for a share of the pie. The Asus Transformer Pro 3, which was first showcased at Computex 2016 in Taiwan, is now available in India. With a premium price tag of R1,44,990, this device is not just a Surface replacement, it’s a straight competitor to the Microsoft device. So is Asus Transformer Pro 3 a good enough option? Here’s our review: At first glance, the Transformer Pro 3 looks and feels exactly like the Surface, which isn’t that exciting. But on closer inspection, you can see that Asus has done a stunning job. The all-metal design is very premium, and the gold looks classy. It has an integrated metal kickstand at the back and Asus says you can set it up at a 170 degree angle as well, which is pretty cool, but a little unnecessary. There’s a separate keyboard; Asus says the keys have 1.4mm travel. From a design perspective, Asus has done an excellent job, although it’s hard to ignore the similarities with the Surface. What is good? The display on the Asus Transformer Pro 3 is 2880×1920 pixels with 3:2 ratio, and when you switch on the device, it’s evident this is a gorgeous one. The blacks are deep, the colours are crisp and vivid. Whether you are just typing out text or looking at spreadsheets, or planning to watch Netflix all day on this device, the screen does not disappoint. The overall audio quality is also quite good. If you’re one of those who like to consume video content on their portable devices, then the Asus Transformer Pro 3 is more than capable of delivering on that front. The display and the sound quality don’t disappoint, and since you can use this as a tablet which has its own stand, portability is not an issue. With 16GB RAM and Intel Core i7 processor, this is more than capable of handling your daily tasks, especially if that includes spending considerable hours on the Microsoft Office Suite. The touch feature on the display is also fast and responsive, and I didn’t notice any lag as such when relying on this functionality. The keyboard lives up to the claims and while it takes some time to get used to the smaller surface area, I had no trouble typing out articles, including this review on the Transformer Pro 3. Asus Transformer Pro 3 also has support for a stylus. I am not much of an artist, but I found the stylus to be responsive even with a fairly light touch. What is not so good? It’s not all perfect for Asus Transformer Pro 3. Despite the beefed up specifications, there is a lag at times with the device. On one instance, the device refused to boot-up for me, and I had to rely on the Power and Volume down button to reboot it. This also has support for Microsoft’s Windows 10 Hello log-in, but that never worked accurately. I am not sure what happened here; I tried logging in more than once, but it refused to work. The battery on this is not impressive at all. I would say the Asus Transformer Pro 3 will give around 6-8 hours at best, which is not good considering this thing comes for a hefty price. I would expect a device costing close to R1.5 lakh to have a 10-hour battery life at the very least. Verdict Let’s face it, not all of us need a convertible device which costs a bomb. Not all of us are artists either, and require a stylus at all times. Asus Transformer Pro 3 is for those who need a powerful, yet easy to carry device that won’t let them down. The stylus is an addition for your creative needs, should you have time, inclination and skills to try it out. Asus delivers on the performance front, and the keyboard is certainly one of the better ones. But the battery is a problem. If you are considering a Surface alternative, and don’t want an iPad Pro, then Asus Transformer Pro 3 can be an option. But is it better than getting a Surface Pro 4? I am not entirely convinced.

It’s impossible to take exception to that conclusion, which is offered in a new audit by the secretary of state’s office of programs that offer tax breaks and loans to companies that promise to create jobs. It is, however, necessary to be clear about what such spending really entails. The biggest economic development program by far involves property tax exemptions offered in local enterprise zones and by the state Strategic Investment Program. These exemptions will total $535 million of the $680 million in the two-year budget period. But no one is writing checks for that amount. Rather, the $535 million is the amount that would be collected if exempt properties were fully taxed. That’s a very big “if” — in many cases, and ideally in all cases, the incentives result in development that would not have occurred without them. The best example is Intel, Oregon’s largest private employer, which will claim about 60 percent of all economic development property tax exemptions through the Strategic Investment Program. In the depths of the recession of the early 1980s, the administration of Gov. Neil Goldschmidt crafted the SIP in an attempt to attract investments by capital-intensive technology companies. Washington and Multnomah counties would not have extra millions in property taxes to spend if Intel had located elsewhere, which it probably would have done without the SIP. That’s not to say that every property tax exemption is fully justified — in some cases, investments might have occurred even without the tax breaks. The audit recommends that Business Oregon develop better ways of measuring the results of incentive programs, in addition to the job-creation and income-level requirements that already exist. The audit also found a troubling disparity in the performance of urban vs. rural economic development incentives. Development has tended to be concentrated in the Portland area, where the economy is healthiest. In 2015, tax exemptions in rural enterprise zones averaged $54,500 per job created, compared to $4,200 in urban enterprise zones. The disparity points to the difficulty of stimulating job growth in rural Oregon — as well as to the fact that the biggest tax exemptions outside the Willamette Valley have gone to such companies as Apple and Facebook, whose capital-intensive data centers employ relatively few people. Aside from property tax exemptions, the audit recommends a tighter rein on tax credits and forgivable loans offered through the state Strategic Reserve Fund program. The state evaluates how long it takes for Oregon to recoup the cost of these benefits through increased taxes and fees. The audit notes that the payback period would in many cases be longer if all state incentives were included in the calculations. The state’s net return on these programs ought to be positive, and only a comprehensive accounting of the public expense can yield a reliable assessment of whether incentives are in the state’s interest. Such accountability depends on transparency — and the audit found that companies are not always required to provide the information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of incentive programs. Businesses are often reluctant to disclose the information that would make such evaluations possible, but a company seeking a tax break or other incentive cannot expect the state to make its decisions in the dark. Public acceptance of economic development incentives will weaken without solid evidence that the investments yield dividends. Support for economic development programs tends to move in the opposite direction of the economic tides — it’s a top priority in times of recession, and is downgraded during periods of growth. The state is best served by programs that remain consistent over time, backed by reliable means of tracking their effectiveness. The recommendations in the secretary of state’s audit can help move Oregon toward that goal.

The entry-level version costs $2399 and includes an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a Radeon Pro 450 graphics chip. It also has Apple’s love-or-hate Touch Bar. Laptop Magazine gave Apple’s new high-end notebook four-and-a-half stars. “The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar offers a slew of neat touch controls, a beautifully slim design and the most blazing performance you can find on a Mac.” The review especially compliments the “innovative” Touch bar, the slim design, the display, and the overall fast performance. However, the lack of an SD card slot, the lack of regular USB ports, and the high price get slated. Some consider the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro overpriced. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Still, there have been some dissatisfied Apple fans. David Gewirtz from ZDNet explains why he cancelled his 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro order. “Apparently, some new 15-inch MacBook Pros are experiencing failure conditions. I first became aware of the problem in a MacRumors article a few days ago. Users are reporting glitches and crashes, along with weird screen artifacts,” Gewirtz claims, adding that when one spends this much money on a laptop, it needs to work perfectly. Some of the commenters after the article slate Apple. “Apple sucks! I wouldn’t spend thousands for their cheap products made in China. Just buy an HP,” says Joel Aldo. “Switched to windows laptop… quarter of price and 4x the performance. With VR/AR coming, Apple is truly and utterly out of touch. Tim Cook is Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer,” claims Adam Musk. Well, there is good news for those who are looking for a MacBook Pro alternative. The current high-end Dell XPS 15 has already received excellent reviews. The version with specs compared to Apple’s MacBook Pro costs $1849. However, like the new MacBook Pro, it contains 2015’s 6th generation processor. According to CNET, the 7th generation Kaby Lake version of the Dell XPS 15 is about to be unveiled. Dell could unveil the next XPS 15 at CES 2017. [Image by Bloomberg/Getty Images] “Right now, the Dell XPS 15 is the only machine with portability and performance to match Apple’s largest laptop. Problem is, its CPU and graphics are about to be a year out of date. It looks like that will change at this year’s CES in January, though, because Dell just leaked the product page for a new XPS 15 — one with Intel’s unreleased quad-core Kaby Lake CPUs and an unannounced Nvidia graphics chip.” The article adds that according to a listing that has recently been removed, the XPS 15 will come with a choice of an Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processor; an optional Nvidea GeForce GTX 1050 graphics chip; and an optional fingerprint sensor. Dell usually keeps the same prices for upgrades as their previous versions, so one will probably be able to save more than $500 when compared to the current 15-inch MacBook Pro, which runs an outdated processor. There is a lot of excitement for the new Dell XPS 15 on Twitter. Very excited – Watch "New Dell XPS 15 Kaby Lake GTX 1050 is [almost] here (9560)" on YouTube https://t.co/g2Ul2YDRwA — Eugene Rosenfeld (@erosen03) December 20, 2016 Website wardrobe malfunction lets slip the new Nvidia-powered Dell XPS 15 – PCGamesN https://t.co/YnHQ7sf3H2 PCGamesN Website wardrobe m… — Dyl Does (@dyl_does) December 21, 2016 For those who want a laptop like the XPS 15 that’s smaller and has the latest 7th generation Kaby Lake processor, the new Dell XPS 13 is now available. Unfortunately, the XPS 13 doesn’t offer a discrete graphics chip, but its high-end version, at $1599, offers enough power to comfortably edit 4K videos. It’s also a lot cheaper than the 13-inch version of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar that has the same specs.

Based in Unterschleissheim near Munich, the new campus will be home to 2000 experts working on every aspect from software development to real-world testing. But the decision to create a base of operations in Munich is also an attempt to ensure Europe is firmly on the map as a hotspot for next-generation automotive technology development. "The road to fully-automated driving is an opportunity for Germany's automobile manufacturing base. The decision to develop and road-test these vehicles in the Munich area illustrates how the BMW Group and the whole region can benefit from this shift in the automotive industry," said Klaus Fröhlich, member of the Board of Management, responsible for Development at the BMW Group. Detroit and Silicon Valley are also trying to establish themselves as the de facto home of the car of the future so it makes sense that European carmakers, whose legacy stretches back 130 years, would want to court and keep the world's leading experts within their own continental borders. However, in a fully connected world, it is impossible for any single company to work in isolation. In order for BMW to bring the iNEXT -- the name it has given its self-driving car -- to fruition on schedule, it has already forged a long-term partnership with US firms Intel and MobilEye. Intel's role in the alliance is to develop in-car processors and to help crunch through the huge amounts of data the project will create. "Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents," explained Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. MobilEye's expertise is in sensing and localization, and its partnership with BMW is one of several it has announced in recent months. For instance, at the 2017 CES in January, MobilEye will be demonstrating the fruits of its partnership with autonomous driving tech company Delphi over a specially created real-world course in Las Vegas. The companies claim the system, called the Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (CSLP) automated driving system, is the most advanced autonomous driving system currently in existence. As for the partnership with BMW, officially announced in July, the companies are already on target to start testing a prototype autonomous vehicle fleet in urban conditions in early 2017. "[This] future development site for autonomous driving will enable us to launch the BMW iNEXT, the first self-driving BMW, onto the market in 2021," said Fröhlich.

Mark Warner, the new top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, is not currently endorsing a select committee. | Getty Some Dems resist new Russia select committee By Burgess Everett 12/22/16 05:14 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The bipartisan push for a special congressional committee to investigate Russian meddling in the election is running into a new hurdle: Senate Democrats. Several members of the party, particularly those on the Intelligence Committee, are noncommittal about setting up a new select committee specifically devoted to cybersecurity that would also investigate Russian influence on the presidential election. Instead, some Democrats will wait to see whether Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will follow through on his pledge to “expeditiously” investigate the electronic break-ins and preside over public hearings about the matter. Story Continued Below Democrats are also protecting their turf. Intelligence Committee members have little to gain right now by breaking with Burr, because they already have access to intelligence briefings that other members are hoping to get access to as part of a broader special panel. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are making a bipartisan push for a special select committee to tackle the Russia hacking — and cybersecurity more broadly. That panel would, under one proposal, take key members from across the various committees with jurisdiction over cybersecurity and create one central clearinghouse for oversight over the Russia hackings as well as cyberthreats from other countries like North Korea and Iran. Schumer, Reed and McCain will all have access to the Intelligence Committee briefings regardless; Reed and McCain are "ex-officio" members of the committee and Schumer will get new intelligence briefings because he is leader of the Democrats. Presidential Transition Lewandowski brokered Trump-Slim meeting By Kenneth P. Vogel, Josh Dawsey and Isaac Arnsdorf Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the new top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, is not currently endorsing a select committee as he looks to forge a partnership with Burr. Still, he's leaving the door open to call for an investigatory shake-up in the future if the current Intel panel investigation stalls. But in the meantime, he's “actively engaged in discussions with Senator Burr” about the course of the current probe rather than calling for a new panel that would step on the Intel Committee's jurisdiction, a spokeswoman said. “Senator Warner believes Congress is obligated to conduct — and the American people deserve — an investigation that is timely, thorough, and bipartisan,” said Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Warner. “One of the goals of the investigation should be to release as much information as possible, while protecting sources and methods, so that the American people can understand exactly what happened.” Warner’s hesitancy reflects the divisions among the committee’s seven Democrats as a whole. They all say they want to get to the bottom of the Russian hacking, but there’s no agreement among them about how to do it. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Tuesday that he’s “not taking a position as to whether it should be a new committee set up just for this purpose or whether the Intelligence committee can handle it.” Ditto Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is not calling for a select committee after just being added to the Intelligence panel. “The intelligence community has raised serious issues about Russia’s attempts to influence our electoral process, and Senator Manchin believes we have a responsibility to investigate what occurred. That said, any investigation now and in the future, must put politics aside and focus solely on how we can protect our Democratic institutions in the future,” said spokesman Jonathan Kott. Presidential Transition Trump’s terror-fighting team yet to take shape By Michael Crowley Democratic staffers said that Intelligence Committee members are loathe to start off 2017 by antagonizing Burr. They’d rather give Burr plenty of time to pursue his own investigation — and seek answers from both the outgoing Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration — while making as much public as possible. “You can see why those members who want to have a thorough investigation would want to do it in [the Intelligence Committee]," said a senior Democratic aide. And if there are early signs that Burr isn’t keeping his word, aides said, then Democrats on the committee could change their tune. Burr’s office declined to comment on the divisions among the committee’s Democrats. A pair of Democrats on the panel, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, both support select committees. "The Russian hacking in the 2016 election — in this case on behalf of an unprecedentedly pro-Russian candidate — strikes at the core of our Democracy and cannot be brushed under the carpet,” Heinrich said in a statement on Wednesday. “There needs to be an independent, bipartisan commission designed solely to investigate Russia's interference in our election." And while Wyden supports a select committee, he’s most concerned with transparency, whatever the exact committee structure is. “His overriding concern is that the government get the facts out to the public quickly, whether they’re being investigated by the intelligence committees, other standing congressional committees, a joint congressional committee, or an independent commission. That includes open hearings,” said Keith Chu, a spokesman for Wyden. Donald Trump's Cabinet-in-waiting: What we know so far By Andrew Restuccia Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who is leaving her post as the committee’s top Democrat, has so far declined to weigh in on the select committee question. She’s called for a bipartisan, bicameral independent commission on the Russian hacking that would report the results to Congress within 18 months, which she believes would “keep the politics of individual members of Congress out of the equation," according to aide. Newly elected Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who will sit on the panel, did not respond to a request for comment. The top four Senate Democratic leaders — Schumer, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan — all support a select committee as do many rank-and-file members. So while there is resistance among Intel Committee Democrats, Schumer is more concerned with convincing Republicans to back his push. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a Russia hawk who sits on the Intel committee, said on Wednesday evening that he opposes the panel. "Lankford supports a full bipartisan investigation, but believes the sensitive classified information involved with this type of investigation should not be publicized. Therefore, he believes the Intelligence Committee should investigate this," said D.J. Jordan, a spokesman for Lankford. Currently just three Republicans — Graham, McCain and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) — have endorsed Schumer's approach. “They know that Sen. McConnell had not come out for it so they’re keeping their powder dry,” Schumer said on an ABC podcast on Wednesday. “But the informal chatter I get is they think it’s a good idea.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Burgess Everett @burgessev This story tagged under: Dianne Feinstein Mark Warner John McCain Russia Senate Senate Intelligence Committee Cory Gardner Richard Burr Lindsey Graham Elections Hacking 2016 Elections James Lankford Jim Lankford Angus King Cyber Security Show Comments Politico Magazine Putin’s Real Long Game By Molly K.

-- The technology sector is a naturally changing, developing and innovative environment. There were several new developments that took place in the automation industry sector recently. According to a research conducted by Global Market Insights, Inc. the automotive electronics market is projected to reach $352.92 billion by 2023, from $185.05 billion in 2015. The projected growth is explained by an increasing adoption of automation technologies by manufacturers across the industry. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) Innovative developments which make vehicles more efficient are taken into consideration alongside the projections. Like for example the new lithium-ion batteries coupled with electronic compressors for hybrid as well as electric vehicles designed to minimize the production costs. Another research by PWC has indicated that demand for the new digital technologies associated with connected and autonomous cars will grow, and with it the list of potential suppliers from outside the traditional automotive supply base. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) operates in a range of business segments and provides solutions to manufacturing industries. Through its Electronics Manufacturing Services group the company provides end-to-end electronic manufacturing services including product design and sustaining engineering services, systems integration, testing services and assembled electronic products. Cemtrex Inc. announced today that, "its consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30th, 2016. Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights: • Revenue increased by 65% to $93,704,560 for the twelve months ended in September 30, 2016 compared to $56,887,389 for the same period in 2015 • Net Income was up 76% to $4,994,045, equaling $0.59 per share, in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $2,838,116 or $0.41 in the same period in 2015. • EBITDA was up 120% to $9,053,839 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to EBITDA of $4,107,748 in the same period in 2015. Commenting on the yearly results, Mr. Saagar Govil, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company remarked, "This past year we were able to complete two strategic acquisitions that allowed our revenues to increase 65%. Out net income also increased 76% mainly due to the increased income from the acquired operations. We have been able to establish a repeat customer base through our proven technologies, cost-effective manufacturing, and on-time delivery of equipment which creates a positive outlook for sustainable revenue growth." "Overall, this year was a great year for Cemtrex with as we have seen our number of shareholders increase substantially and a significant increase in our average trading volume. Additionally, we have recently filed for a Rights offering with Source Group, through the issuance of preferred shares, which when completed, would provide us additional resources for pursuing larger acquisitions. Furthermore, with the incoming Trump administration's plan for increased infrastructure spending, we believe there is a lot to look forward to, as we continue to create value for our shareholders in the coming year," continued Mr. Govil." Automotive company, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), tests its wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving vehicles. General Motors floor pad prototype wireless charging will allow its company's self-driving cars to charge on its own by driving into a parking spot or garage capable of wirelessly charging at 7.7 kilowatt and 11KW charge. "Wireless charging is a technology that our customers have told us they are interested in," Pamela Fletcher, GM executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said in a statement. "By testing the WiTricity prototype system, we can ensure that wireless charging systems will comply with proposed industry standards, which benefit the entire industry and consumers." Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Panasonic Corporation has had a long partnership together when it comes to the supply of Tesla's car batteries. Conversely, Tesla is looking at other options to decrease risks, leaning more towards suppliers from South Korea. According to Teslarati, a source for Tesla News, the company has met with electronic giants Samsung SDI, LG Chem and SK innovation, to talk over the possibility of supplying car batteries for Tesla's electronic cars. Tesla cars will be provided with tires from Hanjook Tire tires, and the OLED panels for the automotive systems will be by LG Display. An official from Tesla has released a statement saying: "Tesla intends to use more Korean technology on its Model 3... Tesla is testing the manufacturing capability and production of LG Chem, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation." Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said the company will use $250 million over the next two years toward the development of self-driving cars. It's a clear sign that the computer chip giant wants to play a huge role in the future of automobiles. In a statement, Intel says the investment will help "push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more." Beforehand, the BMW said it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY), the Israeli supplier of driver assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry, to produce fully autonomous vehicles by 2021.

Latest Global Business Brief: the Trump effect, the F-35, Boeing and 2016’s big business stories. A New Military Jet Flies Just One Year After It Was Designed The American Leader in ISIS General Fires Back at Trump: F-35 ‘Not Out of Control’ What Are Turkey and Russia Doing in Syria? Sponsor Content Managing and Improving Military Readiness in a Timely and Cost-Effective Manner Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas DNC Hackers Linked to Russian Activity Against Ukraine Two Years Ago By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 CROWDSTRIKE AA Font size + Print A Crowdstrike Illustration of the FANCY BEAR group believed to be linked to the Russian military intelligence service. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 The same malware a Russian group used to attacked the DNC was targeting Ukrainian soldiers, says cybersecurity group. In the same way that a masterpiece bears the distinct signature of its maker, so does a masterpiece of malware. Consider the case of FANCY BEAR, one of the two groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee’s, or DNC, networks and which the intelligence community and cybersecurity pros believe to be connected to the Russian military intelligence service, or GRU. Crowdstrike, the company that found hackers on the DNC network, on Thursday published a report showing that FANCY BEAR used the same malware as part of combat operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, which enabled the Russian troops to better target Ukrainian artillery positions. It’s one of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge to show the connection between the Russian military and the concerted effort to influence the 2016 presidential election through the publication of stolen emails. The malware in question is called X-Agent. Cybersecurity group TrendMicro originally discovered it in 2015 and connected it to a broad espionage operation from the Russian government aimed at political and military targets in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. It’s a piece of malware well known to the Putin-backed group that hacked the DNC, also known as FANCY BEAR. As Crowdstrike’s Dimitri Alperovitch describes in his June blog post on the DNC hack, the environment was sick with  “X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging.” Here’s what’s new, according to Crowdstrike. In 2013, a Ukrainian soldier named Yaroslav Sherstuk, with the 55th Artillery brigade developed a mobile phone application to help aim its long guns. The Android app was intended “to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. It was a math app for real time combat. Ukrainian soldiers using Soviet-era Howitzers had to  figure out the elevation of the target and the curvature of the earth, etc., using pen and paper, which took too much time. Sherstuk’s app did the same job quickly and easily: plug in the coordinates of the targets and the app would tell you settings that you needed to set for the Howitzer. Targeting time went from minutes to 15 seconds. When fighting began in Ukraine, the app spread among users on VK (the Russian-language Facebook knock off) and the like, eventually reaching more than 9,000 downloads. The Russian military realized that they could simply infect the app with X-Agent and the malware would spread as quickly as the app. “On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014,” Crowdstrike writes in their report. The pro-Russian fighters could find Ukrainian soldiers who were using the app to plan howitzer fires because the Ukrainians had given away their position through the app. As a result, Russian artillery launched more than 120 attacks on Ukrainians in 2014 between the July 9 and Sept. 5. As open source investigative group Bellingcat makes clear in this post: “In the days and weeks that followed, the units at the border were subjected to dozens of additional artillery attacks. By late July 2014, the massive bombardment reversed Ukrainian gains and contributed to the encirclement of portions of the Ukrainian armed forces. A separatist offensive across eastern Ukraine began simultaneously with the artillery attacks, leading to the separatists capturing much of the Russian-Ukrainian border along with vast areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. “The pressure of sustained artillery attacks through early August led Ukrainian armed forces to lose control of hundreds of kilometers of border territory.” By some estimates, they lost more than 80 percent of their D-30 Howitzers, well beyond what they lost for other artillery pieces. Bottom line: The presence of the same bit of malware on the phones of Ukrainian soldiers just before they were fired on in 2014 – and then in the DNC servers just before embarrassing emails were published to Wikileaks in 2016  — is more than a coincidence. X Agent is not the sort of thing you find on GitHub. “We have only seen it used by FANCY BEAR. The source code for it has never been found on any public or underground forum,” Alperovitch told Defense One. What this shows is that the same Putin-backed actors that targeted the DNC were targeting soldiers in Ukraine in 2014. And it is unlikely that a 400 pound U.S. hacker (or for that matter, the Chinese) were helping Russian forces target Ukrainian Howitzers in the Donbass in 2014.

Like for example the new lithium-ion batteries coupled with electronic compressors for hybrid as well as electric vehicles designed to minimize the production costs. Another research by PWC has indicated that demand for the new digital technologies associated with connected and autonomous cars will grow, and with it the list of potential suppliers from outside the traditional automotive supply base. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) operates in a range of business segments and provides solutions to manufacturing industries. Through its Electronics Manufacturing Services group the company provides end-to-end electronic manufacturing services including product design and sustaining engineering services, systems integration, testing services and assembled electronic products. Cemtrex Inc. announced today that, “its consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30th, 2016. Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights: • Revenue increased by 65% to $93,704,560 for the twelve months ended in September 30, 2016 compared to $56,887,389 for the same period in 2015 • Net Income was up 76% to $4,994,045, equaling $0.59 per share, in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $2,838,116 or $0.41 in the same period in 2015. • EBITDA was up 120% to $9,053,839 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to EBITDA of $4,107,748 in the same period in 2015. Commenting on the yearly results, Mr. Saagar Govil, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company remarked, “This past year we were able to complete two strategic acquisitions that allowed our revenues to increase 65%. Out net income also increased 76% mainly due to the increased income from the acquired operations. We have been able to establish a repeat customer base through our proven technologies, cost-effective manufacturing, and on-time delivery of equipment which creates a positive outlook for sustainable revenue growth.” “Overall, this year was a great year for Cemtrex with as we have seen our number of shareholders increase substantially and a significant increase in our average trading volume. Additionally, we have recently filed for a Rights offering with Source Group, through the issuance of preferred shares, which when completed, would provide us additional resources for pursuing larger acquisitions. Furthermore, with the incoming Trump administration’s plan for increased infrastructure spending, we believe there is a lot to look forward to, as we continue to create value for our shareholders in the coming year,” continued Mr. Govil.” Automotive company, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), tests its wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving vehicles. General Motors floor pad prototype wireless charging will allow its company’s self-driving cars to charge on its own by driving into a parking spot or garage capable of wirelessly charging at 7.7 kilowatt and 11KW charge. “Wireless charging is a technology that our customers have told us they are interested in,” Pamela Fletcher, GM executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said in a statement. “By testing the WiTricity prototype system, we can ensure that wireless charging systems will comply with proposed industry standards, which benefit the entire industry and consumers.” Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Panasonic Corporation has had a long partnership together when it comes to the supply of Tesla’s car batteries. Conversely, Tesla is looking at other options to decrease risks, leaning more towards suppliers from South Korea. According to Teslarati, a source for Tesla News, the company has met with electronic giants Samsung SDI, LG Chem and SK innovation, to talk over the possibility of supplying car batteries for Tesla’s electronic cars. Tesla cars will be provided with tires from Hanjook Tire tires, and the OLED panels for the automotive systems will be by LG Display. An official from Tesla has released a statement saying: “Tesla intends to use more Korean technology on its Model 3… Tesla is testing the manufacturing capability and production of LG Chem, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation.” Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said the company will use $250 million over the next two years toward the development of self-driving cars. It’s a clear sign that the computer chip giant wants to play a huge role in the future of automobiles. In a statement, Intel says the investment will help “push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” Beforehand, the BMW said it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY), the Israeli supplier of driver assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry, to produce fully autonomous vehicles by 2021.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 The same malware a Russian group used to attacked the DNC was targeting Ukrainian soldiers, says cybersecurity group. In the same way that a masterpiece bears the distinct signature of its maker, so does a masterpiece of malware. Consider the case of FANCY BEAR, one of the two groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee’s, or DNC, networks and which the intelligence community and cybersecurity pros believe to be connected to the Russian military intelligence service, or GRU. Crowdstrike, the company that found hackers on the DNC network, on Thursday published a report showing that FANCY BEAR used the same malware as part of combat operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, which enabled the Russian troops to better target Ukrainian artillery positions. It’s one of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge to show the connection between the Russian military and the concerted effort to influence the 2016 presidential election through the publication of stolen emails. The malware in question is called X-Agent. Cybersecurity group TrendMicro originally discovered it in 2015 and connected it to a broad espionage operation from the Russian government aimed at political and military targets in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. It’s a piece of malware well known to the Putin-backed group that hacked the DNC, also known as FANCY BEAR. As Crowdstrike’s Dimitri Alperovitch describes in his June blog post on the DNC hack, the environment was sick with  “X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging.” Here’s what’s new, according to Crowdstrike. In 2013, a Ukrainian soldier named Yaroslav Sherstuk, with the 55th Artillery brigade developed a mobile phone application to help aim its long guns. The Android app was intended “to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. It was a math app for real time combat. Ukrainian soldiers using Soviet-era Howitzers had to  figure out the elevation of the target and the curvature of the earth, etc., using pen and paper, which took too much time. Sherstuk’s app did the same job quickly and easily: plug in the coordinates of the targets and the app would tell you settings that you needed to set for the Howitzer. Targeting time went from minutes to 15 seconds. When fighting began in Ukraine, the app spread among users on VK (the Russian-language Facebook knock off) and the like, eventually reaching more than 9,000 downloads. The Russian military realized that they could simply infect the app with X-Agent and the malware would spread as quickly as the app. “On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014,” Crowdstrike writes in their report. The pro-Russian fighters could find Ukrainian soldiers who were using the app to plan howitzer fires because the Ukrainians had given away their position through the app. As a result, Russian artillery launched more than 120 attacks on Ukrainians in 2014 between the July 9 and Sept. 5. As open source investigative group Bellingcat makes clear in this post: “In the days and weeks that followed, the units at the border were subjected to dozens of additional artillery attacks. By late July 2014, the massive bombardment reversed Ukrainian gains and contributed to the encirclement of portions of the Ukrainian armed forces. A separatist offensive across eastern Ukraine began simultaneously with the artillery attacks, leading to the separatists capturing much of the Russian-Ukrainian border along with vast areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. “The pressure of sustained artillery attacks through early August led Ukrainian armed forces to lose control of hundreds of kilometers of border territory.” By some estimates, they lost more than 80 percent of their D-30 Howitzers, well beyond what they lost for other artillery pieces. Bottom line: The presence of the same bit of malware on the phones of Ukrainian soldiers just before they were fired on in 2014 – and then in the DNC servers just before embarrassing emails were published to Wikileaks in 2016  — is more than a coincidence. X Agent is not the sort of thing you find on GitHub. “We have only seen it used by FANCY BEAR. The source code for it has never been found on any public or underground forum,” Alperovitch told Defense One. What this shows is that the same Putin-backed actors that targeted the DNC were targeting soldiers in Ukraine in 2014. And it is unlikely that a 400 pound U.S. hacker (or for that matter, the Chinese) were helping Russian forces target Ukrainian Howitzers in the Donbass in 2014.

There is Intel’s Andy Grove, the chief executive who helped guide the computer industry into its modern era. Google has Sergey Brin. Microsoft? Satya Nadella. Run through nearly any big tech company and you’ll find its executive ranks filled with people who were born outside the United States. That brings us to Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging service WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014. Photo That Mr. Koum is also an immigrant is not unusual in Silicon Valley. What does make him unusual is the popularity of WhatsApp among immigrants. As Farhad Manjoo writes, WhatsApp has become a low-cost communications line between countries, even as some countries occasionally try to block its use. The popularity of WhatsApp, with more than a billion users, is by no means limited to the world’s immigrants, of course. People of all sorts have found it a useful — and simple — means of communication. But as Farhad writes, because it is free and has a fairly strong record on privacy and security, WhatsApp has become a part of immigrant life around the world. And its early adoptees often are older people who encourage their children or grandchildren to start using it so they can stay in touch. As Mr. Koum put it, the app “was designed in part by someone living the immigrant experience every day.” Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

The change, which comes just four weeks before the end of President Obama’s last term, removes the skeleton of a program that hasn’t been in use since 2011. When it was active, the “special registration” program—the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or NSEERS—had two parts, and applied only to people from 25 countries named by DHS. Twenty-four of them were Muslim-majority countries. One half of NSEERS was a domestic “call-in” registration program that required men ages 16 and up living in the U.S. to report regularly to immigration officials. The other half was an entry and exit tracking system, which limited the airports, seaports, and land borders that registrants could use to travel, and required them to register before leaving and after arriving. Related Story America Already Had a Muslim Registry NSEERS began in September 2002. The domestic call-in program was ended in December 2003, and the remaining entry and exit program was suspended in 2011, when DHS removed all 25 countries from the list of required participants. At the time, civil-rights groups asked the Obama administration to remove the regulations entirely, to prevent the program from being resurrected, and had intensified their calls recently, after Trump suggested using “watchlists” or “registries” to surveil Muslims in the U.S. The complete dismantling of NSEERS doesn’t prevent Trump from creating a new program to track people from Muslim-majority countries. But nor is it only a symbolic rejection of similar programs from the outgoing president. Leaving the program in place would have given Trump a turnkey registry in waiting. “DHS ceased use of NSEERS more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,” a spokesperson for the agency said Thursday. “The intervening years have shown that NSEERS is not only obsolete, but that its use would divert limited personnel and resources from more effective measures.” A 2012 report from the DHS inspector general found that the program used buggy technology, relied on faulty databases, and cost the government $10 million per year to run. The inspector general recommended dismantling the program entirely, but the agency declined to follow that recommendation at the time. On Friday, when the government’s official notice will be printed in the Federal Register, the regulations behind the special-registration program will no longer exist.

It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Marc Burckhardt The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus’s Wife Ariel Sabar A hotly contested, supposedly ancient manuscript suggests Christ was married. But believing its origin story—a real-life Da Vinci Code, involving a Harvard professor, a onetime Florida pornographer, and an escape from East Germany—requires a big leap of faith. On a humid afternoon this past November, I pulled off Interstate 75 into a stretch of Florida pine forest tangled with runaway vines. My GPS was homing in on the house of a man I thought might hold the master key to one of the strangest scholarly mysteries in recent decades: a 1,300-year-old scrap of papyrus that bore the phrase “Jesus said to them, My wife.” The fragment, written in the ancient language of Coptic, had set off shock waves when an eminent Harvard historian of early Christianity, Karen L. King, presented it in September 2012 at a conference in Rome. Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to Jesus’s being married. The papyrus’s lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles over whether his “wife”—possibly Mary Magdalene—was “worthy” of discipleship. Its main point, King argued, was that “women who are wives and mothers can be Jesus’s disciples.” She thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether “marriage or celibacy [was] the ideal mode of Christian life” and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro The War on Stupid People David H. Freedman American society increasingly mistakes intelligence for human worth. As recently as the 1950s, possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit your life’s trajectory. IQ wasn’t a big factor in whom you married, where you lived, or what others thought of you. The qualifications for a good job, whether on an assembly line or behind a desk, mostly revolved around integrity, work ethic, and a knack for getting along—bosses didn’t routinely expect college degrees, much less ask to see SAT scores. As one account of the era put it, hiring decisions were “based on a candidate having a critical skill or two and on soft factors such as eagerness, appearance, family background, and physical characteristics.” The 2010s, in contrast, are a terrible time to not be brainy. Those who consider themselves bright openly mock others for being less so. Even in this age of rampant concern over microaggressions and victimization, we maintain open season on the nonsmart. People who’d swerve off a cliff rather than use a pejorative for race, religion, physical appearance, or disability are all too happy to drop the s‑bomb: Indeed, degrading others for being “stupid” has become nearly automatic in all forms of disagreement. Continue Reading NBC Seth Meyers Proves He's the Anti-Fallon David Sims The Late Night host ripped into Donald Trump’s history with the birther movement, just days after his NBC colleague’s softball interview with the candidate. When Jimmy Fallon talked to Donald Trump on The Tonight Show last week, he ruffled the presidential candidate’s hair. Seth Meyers, the host of Fallon’s former show Late Night, had a slightly different message for the Republican presidential candidate last night. “Obama was born in the United States, period?” he asked mockingly, repeating Trump’s recent specious assertion that he was no longer a believer in the “birther” movement. “Fuck you, exclamation point!” Sadly, Meyers couldn’t say this to Trump’s face—in fact, until last week, the late-night host had jokingly banned the candidate from appearing on the show as a response to Trump’s ban of The Washington Post from his press events. He recently lifted that ban after Trump did the same, but joked to The Huffington Post that Late Night was “pretty booked up” on guests from now through November. But even if he were invited, it’s hard to imagine Trump appearing on Meyers’s show, which has become an appreciable counterbalance to the much more light-hearted antics of his hair-ruffling network partner. Continue Reading Olaf Blecker The Binge Breaker Bianca Bosker Tristan Harris believes Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones. He’s determined to make it stop. On a recent evening in San Francisco, Tristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, took a name tag from a man in pajamas called “Honey Bear” and wrote down his pseudonym for the night: “Presence.” Harris had just arrived at Unplug SF, a “digital detox experiment” held in honor of the National Day of Unplugging, and the organizers had banned real names. Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. Continue Reading Sara Wong / The Atlantic No Spanking, No Time-Out, No Problems Olga Khazan A child psychologist argues punishment is a waste of time when trying to eliminate problem behavior. Try this instead. Say you have a problem child. If it’s a toddler, maybe he smacks his siblings. Or she refuses to put on her shoes as the clock ticks down to your morning meeting at work. If it’s a teenager, maybe he peppers you with obscenities during your all-too-frequent arguments. The answer is to punish them, right? Not so, says Alan Kazdin, director of the Yale Parenting Center. Punishment might make you feel better, but it won’t change the kid’s behavior. Instead, he advocates for a radical technique in which parents positively reinforce the behavior they do want to see until the negative behavior eventually goes away. As I was reporting my recent series about child abuse, I came to realize that parents fall roughly into three categories. There’s a small number who seem intuitively to do everything perfectly: Moms and dads with chore charts that actually work and snack-sized bags of organic baby carrots at the ready. There’s an even smaller number who are horrifically abusive to their kids. But the biggest chunk by far are parents in the middle. They’re far from abusive, but they aren’t super-parents, either. They’re busy and stressed, so they’re too lenient one day and too harsh the next. They have outdated or no knowledge of child psychology, and they’re scrambling to figure it all out. Continue Reading Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP What Americans Don’t Get About Nordic Countries Anu Partanen When U.S. politicians talk about Scandinavian-style social welfare, they fail to explain the most important aspect of such policies: selfishness. Bernie Sanders is hanging on, still pushing his vision of a Nordic-like socialist utopia for America, and his supporters love him for it. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is chalking up victories by sounding more sensible. “We are not Denmark,” she said in the first Democratic debate, pointing instead to America’s strengths as a land of freedom for entrepreneurs and businesses. Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Sanders’s Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they’d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That’s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too. A Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I’m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I’m told, because they are small, homogeneous “nanny states” where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family. This, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don’t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I’m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good. What this is mostly taken to mean is that Americans will never, ever agree to pay higher taxes to provide universal social services, as the Nordics do. Thus Bernie Sanders, and anyone else in the U.S. who brings up Nordic countries as an example for America, is living in la-la land. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters 'He Was the Nationalist Candidate' Emma Green The editor of First Things on Donald Trump and the limits of multi-cultural democracy As Donald Trump prepares to take office, R.R. Reno of First Things is feeling “guardedly optimistic.” The editor of the conservative, religious magazine cautiously supported the Republican’s candidacy. Reno does not believe Trump will fix what he sees as America’s frayed social contract. But he does think the incoming president will disrupt the current political system, which he considers deeply flawed. I spoke with Reno about his outlook for the coming administration. We discussed Reno’s reasons for supporting Trump (“I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for [Trump’s] policies,” he said); the alt-right (a kind of performance art, he argues); and how Christian principles should influence policy (“Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church … This is one of the reasons why we’re such a dangerous country,” he said). At its center, though, our conversation was about the possibilities and limits of multi-cultural democracy—what makes a nation, and what’s happening to visions of a global, open-borders world. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Democrats Have a Religion Problem Emma Green A conversation with Michael Wear, a former Obama White House staffer, about the party’s illiteracy on and hostility toward white evangelicals. There aren’t many people like Michael Wear in today’s Democratic Party. The former director of Barack Obama’s 2012 faith-outreach efforts is a theologically conservative evangelical Christian. He is opposed to both abortion and same-sex marriage, although he would argue that those are primarily theological positions, and other issues, including poverty and immigration, are also important to his faith. During his time working for Obama, Wear was often alone in many of his views, he writes in his new book, Reclaiming Hope. He helped with faith-outreach strategies for Obama’s 2008 campaign, but was surprised when some state-level officials decided not to pursue this kind of engagement: “Sometimes—as I came to understand the more I worked in politics—a person’s reaction to religious ideas is not ideological at all, but personal,” he writes. Continue Reading Mitch Dumke / Reuters The Dangerous Myth That Hillary Clinton Ignored the Working Class Derek Thompson To many white Trump voters, the problem wasn’t her economic stance, but the larger vision—a multi-ethnic social democracy—that it was a part of. Perhaps the clearest takeaway from the November election for many liberals is that Hillary Clinton lost because she ignored the working class. In the days after her shocking loss, Democrats complained that Clinton had no jobs agenda. A widely shared essay in The Nation blamed Clinton's "neoliberalism" for abandoning the voters who swung the election. “I come from the white working class,” Bernie Sanders said on CBS This Morning, “and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.” But here is the troubling reality for civically minded liberals looking to justify their preferred strategies: Hillary Clinton talked about the working class, middle class jobs, and the dignity of work constantly. And she still lost. Continue Reading How to Turn Anxiety Into Excitement Jeremy Raff and Olga Khazan It takes three words.

Two data-transfer buses. Something like that. Both OpenIO and Igneous have launched plug-on ARM server cards for storage drives: these single-board computers each snap onto a hard drive to form nano-servers that are organized into a grid of object storage nodes. Igneous’s CEO Kiran Bhageshpur cryptically declares that “we have only half-announced the Igneous Data Service,” and leaves us humble hacks wondering what he is on about. El Reg covered Igneous when it launched its service in October. There were two parts to Igneous’ concept: a subscription service to a managed on-premises storage array presented like a public cloud S3 API-accessed storage service; and the actual technology, with two 1U stateless x86 dataRouters (aka controllers) fronting a 4U dataBox containing 60 nano-servers (ARM server + 1Gbit/s Ethernet port + 3.5-inch disk drive). Igneous was founded in 2013, with lots of Isilon experience in its seven founders’ backgrounds. It gained $3.1 million in seed funding that year, and received $23.6 million in an A-round in 2014. Two years later, it has announced initial hardware and software product availability. At the Silicon Valley briefing, we had a chance to find out more about this object storage box. We’ll concentrate on the technology here and why it was developed the way it has been, rather than on the cloud-focussed subscription service. Igenous CEO and cofounder Kiran Bhageshpur The hardware The dataBox is a JBOND (just a bunch of networked drives), and Igneous says: “Each nano-server has its own ARM-based processor, memory, disk controller, redundant Ethernet controllers, and boot flash. In essence, every drive itself is a server that talks IPv6 over Ethernet. Nano-servers can simply fail in place.” Each strap-on board has a 32-bit ARMv7 1GHz dual-ARM-Cortex-A9-core Marvell Armada 370 system-on-chip that includes two 1Gbps Ethernet ports and can talk SATA to the direct-attached 3.5-inch disk drive. That processor gives the card enough compute power to run Linux right up against the storage. The JBOND has 212TB usable from 60 x 6TB drives organized in 2 x (20 + 8) erasure coded drive sets. The dataRouter, an original design manufacture from Intel, is responsible for the management and remote control of an Igneous deployment. Two dataRouters are preferable for high availability, and dataRouter and dataBox scale independently. Igneous suggests that, with 4 dataBoxes (848TB), 3 x dataRouters are generally deployed and recommended, still offering an N+1 redundancy. For scale ... Igneous nanoserver with drive and system board separated and then plugged in Bhageshpur talked about data-centric computing with IoT, sensor, and media data growing in scale. He said on-premises data storage was needed because certain kinds of data had to be stored securely, meaning behind a customer’s firewall. The use of nano-servers restricts the failure domain size to the individual disk drive, with drives able to fail in place, and he asserted that giving each drive its own ARM server and Ethernet port meant there were no bottlenecks in the system. He discussed Seagate’s Kinetic drives, saying Seagate did not let you run code on the Kinetic drives, and these drives have never been put into production. A failed startup called Coraid had Ethernet-addressed storage, using the AoE protocol, but Coraid was too early and failed. Igneous software The software stack running in the Igneous hardware provides patented Reed-Solomon-based erasure coding. Nano-servers’ interactions are coordinated by software running in the dataRouter and in the Igneous cloud. The dataBox implements a fully-distributed, key:value store, and performance can be up to 650MB/s for large sequential GETs and PUTs with concurrent streams. The goal is to be as performant as S3 from an overall capacity point of view. Youtube Video It is extensible to search and other (micro) services, cloud native services, with Bhageshpur mentioning data inspection, indexing, transforming and reducing as potential services. For example, data could be searched for based on metadata created by applications instead of only the storage attributes created by a filer. Check out this video for more insight into this. We're reminded of Coho Data and its technology enabling storage-related services to run directly in its array. That product does not, though, use Ethernet-addressed drives. Services CTO Jeff Hughes talks about classifying images in machine learning in the video. For example, when image data is written (on PUT) it could also be classified. Hughes says it’s like bring cloud functions/services like Amazon’s Lambda directly into a customer’s data center. He also says Igneous has made it possible to run containerized data services directly inline with data operations without impacting latency. Target applications would involve datasets generated by machines, with a need for low latency and high throughput. He said initial use-cases could be auto-tagging, metadata extraction, image processing, and text analysis. Bhageshpur told us: “We will offer services leveraging our architecture in the future,” and that the architecture allows them to add more compute and SSDs. He said Igneous will build services, as will partners and customers – but not write code to run on the nano-servers directly. The Igneous system is a black box that runs S3 services. We asked about HDFS support. The answer was “not today.” When pressed, he said: “At present, the Igneous appliance supports object storage via the use of Amazon’s S3 API. It also supports FTP for data migration. We will support other protocols as we go forward. Azure store maybe.” We imagine partners could add protocol converters to the dataRouters, which are x86 Linux systems. Bhageshpur’s backing VCs and customers get much more information about these promised Igneous data services, but only under a non-disclosure agreement, which we weren’t offered, of course. That left us frustrated, and scrabbling to try and imagine what the heck was sexy enough about these coming services to unlock VC and customer wallets. We can’t get that excited about the system because we simply don’t know enough about it. Getting back to the mundane, Igneous has white papers covering Igneous system use by Arq and Commvault for backup, CloudBerry and Cyberduck, infinite IO, s3cmd and Storage Made Easy. Igneous’ pricing for the minimum 212TB usable configuration is less than $40,000/year for 212TiB increments, which equates to less than $200/TB/year or around 1.5 cents per GB per month. Put another way, 1$/year gets you 5.3GB of usable capacity, or 1 usable TB costs $188 per year. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 13 Comments More from The Register OpenIO pulls up ARM controller SOCs: Kinetic's Marvellous... can anybody do it?

Restaurants Education Environment Bend Deschutes County Politics OSU-Cascades Marijuana Home Local / State Incentive programs for businesses are the latest to receive scrutiny print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Oregon news: state agency audits Incentive programs for businesses are the latest to receive scrutiny By Saul Hubbard / The (Eugene) Register-Guard / Published Dec 21, 2016 at 12:02AM EUGENE — Oregon should work to ensure better return on investment and transparency in the $340 million a year in tax breaks and cash incentives it provides to businesses, a new audit from the Secretary of State’s Office concludes. The audit, released Monday, examines Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, and the incentives it provides directly to private companies. Those sweeteners — including forgivable and low-interest loans, tax credits, and direct cash assistance — total $72.5 million a year. But the review also examined property tax waivers granted by local governments through state-approved enterprise zones and the Strategic Investment Program. Those add up to $267.5 million a year in waived property taxes throughout Oregon. Technology firm Intel is the biggest recipient with $162.5 million a year in tax breaks from Washington and Multnomah counties. Lane County currently has several enterprise zones, which provide property tax waivers to a wide range of companies. Hynix, which shut its West Eugene plant in 2008, was the county’s largest recipient of property tax breaks: $65 million over 10 years. “It is critical that Business Oregon and other state agencies regularly evaluate and improve their business subsidy programs to make the best use of limited public resources,” Secretary of State Jeanne Atkins said, in a prepared statement. “Taxpayers should expect nothing less.” Generally, the audit found that economic development officials, when they give a business an incentive, aren’t adequately monitoring and reporting the number of jobs the company creates or retains, the wages of those jobs, and the state’s overall return on investment. For example, analyzing 231 direct Business Oregon incentives between 2011 and 2012, the audit found that most went to firms where wages were lower, on average, than those in the surrounding county as a whole. The audit also found that only 30 percent of Business Oregon incentives between 2006 and 2015 went to firms in rural areas, even though urban areas “already have faster employment growth.” Regarding the enterprise zones created by local governments, the audit found that the standard zones appear to be working better than the long-term rural zones, which provide a longer tax break. In 2015, each new job in a long-term rural enterprise zone cost $55,000 in waived property taxes, versus $4,200 per job in standard zones. Data storage centers, which tech giants like Apple, Facebook, and Google have built in Oregon in recent years, have been particularly costly in terms of job creation, the audit found. Data centers’ combination of high investment in equipment — meaning potentially high property taxes — and few workers needed to maintain them, meant that each job they created cost $87,000 to nearly $800,000 in lost property taxes in 2015. The audit also concludes that, despite some recent improvements, there is still a lack of transparency in the different tax breaks and other incentives that the state and local governments provide. For example, some subsidy programs don’t publicly disclose what requirements — like a set number of created jobs or investment in a facility — businesses must comply with in order to receive their incentive. Others don’t provide details on whether a recipient ultimately complied with those requirements or not. 15958701 View next article in Local/State     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Richard Lai, @richardlai 12.21.16 in Robots Comments 1036 Shares Share Tweet Share Save At Computex, ASUS captured the hearts of many with its cute home robot, Zenbo, with Chairman Jonney Shih hinting at a retail launch before end of this year. Well, he's not too far off in the end. At today's local launch event, the company announced that its Intel-powered bot will be up for grabs in Taiwan on January 1st, albeit in a limited quantity for the first batch. Price-wise it starts from NT$19,900 or about US$620 -- just a tad more than the intended $599 price point -- for the 32GB standard package, and then there's a 128GB model plus self-charging dock for NT$24,900 or about US$780. But the biggest news today is perhaps ASUS' collaboration with Taiwan's National Police Agency, in order to enable emergency video calls with the police via Zenbo. Details are vague at the moment, but we did see a live demo in which a demonstrator pinged the actual call center (which is probably why they only did the demo once). When this feature eventually rolls out, my guess is that this will require a special voice command or gesture for toggling, and maybe the police can even take over Zenbo's control to better assess the situation. Other additions made to the Zenbo's voice-controlled feature list mainly surround local services, including food delivery, taxi or van booking, online shopping, banking, medicine prescription, music streaming, house cleaning, gaming and more, but we'll have to wait and see how far voice commands will take us for these. With kid companionship being one of the big selling points, Shih also unveiled a simple Blockly-based programming suite that will let children as young as five years old use basic logic to automate a Zenbo's movements. As for the even younger kids, they'll also be entertained by simple games and story-telling, which now include an optional subscription featuring Shimajiro the Tiger (aka Eric in Taiwan) -- the 32GB model comes with a one-month free subscription with 19 stories, whereas the 128GB model offers an extra month. As for the basic set of features, Zenbo is able to control your TV plus stream content to it, be remote-controlled to roam around home for surveillance purposes, human fall-detection alert via a ZenWatch 3, and offer remote screen assistance to help those who aren't as tech savvy. All of these go on top of the Zenbo's collision and drop avoidance capabilities thanks to the sensors dotted around its body, as well as its depth camera in its head for facial and object recognition. For those living outside of Taiwan, it'll likely be a while before Zenbo makes its way to other markets, which is just as well since such a product will only learn quicker as its user base grows. Besides, it's much more useful when local services plus speech recognition are properly tuned in each market, so it'll be worth the wait. But of course, you can always fly over to Taiwan to pick up a Zenbo -- just make sure you have an extra plane ticket for the little guy.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS By Joel Hruska on December 21, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Apple’s recent MacBook Pro updates and “courageous” iPhone 7 have proven to be controversial, and a recent pair of news items highlights how much pent-up frustration is aimed at the device manufacturer. First, Tim Cook made several posts to an Apple employee bulletin board, detailing Apple’s thinking on thinking on both desktops and the intersection between hardware and software design. Cook writes: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that… From a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can. That’s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it’s something that we look for in new employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook. A brand new report from Bloomberg offers an interesting counterweight to Cook’s confidence. According to that investigation, Apple has made a number of strategic decisions that took emphasis away from the Mac design teams. The software team has been reorganized, such that a dedicated macOS team no longer exists and most of the software engineers at Apple are iOS first, Mac second. Hardware engineers are now asked to work on multiple projects at once, or to develop multiple versions of a potential product simultaneously. For example, Apple engineers working on the 2016 MacBook update reportedly wanted to add a second USB-C port and Touch ID support, according to the report. Instead, Apple pushed out a slightly iteration of the same platform and a new “rose gold” color. Engineers working on Mac hardware no longer command the same attention from Jony Ive, the report said, and the appetite for leapfrogging the competition with a more daring approach to technology doesn’t always pay dividends — apparently Apple intended to introduce new battery technology with the MacBook Pro, but unspecified problems killed that option. The Bloomberg report concludes on this note: “Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.” Apple’s innovation decline Part of the problem Apple is facing is straightforward: CPUs haven’t really scaled since 2013. I discussed this last August, but it bears repeating. The image below shows the CPUs Apple currently sells in the three-year-old Mac Pro as compared with the most recent chips available from Intel: Each 2013-era chip is contrasted with its 2016 equivalent. Now, the one thing Apple could do is introduce some high core-count chips that weren’t really available in 2013. Back then, the Xeon E5v2 family topped out at 12 cores; modern CPUs in the E5v4 family top out at 22 cores within the same 135W TDP. But that option carries a hefty frequency penalty: The 12-core E5-2697v2 has a base clock of 2.7GHz and a boost clock of 3.5GHz. The 22-core E5-4699v4 has a 2.2GHz base frequency and a 3GHz boost clock. In other words, if your workload is embarrassingly parallel and can easily scale above 12 threads, the E5-4699v4 is a better option. If it doesn’t — or if you can’t afford the $7,000 price tag Intel has hung on the chip — you won’t see benefits. The GPU market is a markedly different story. AMD’s Polaris refresh would be a good fit for the iMac or even potentially lower-end variants of the Mac Pro, while Vega should address the Mac Pro market head-on (and of course, Nvidia has its own lineup of GPUs, should Apple be interested). Either way, the GPUs baked into current Mac systems are quite old. Apple has never put graphics front-and-center, and it failed to follow up on the graphics-centric argument it made for the Mac Pro. Instead of investing in OpenGL or OpenCL (macOS still only supports OCL 1.2, despite OCL 2.0 now being widely available), Apple has doubled-down on Metal, its own custom iOS API that it also backported to macOS. But major companies like Adobe, which do make use of GPU acceleration, have only begun to add Metal support and it’s not fully baked yet. But I don’t think the issues Apple is facing with macOS and its various Mac systems are simply a matter of lackluster hardware cycles. Apple used to present buyers with a very simple argument: “It just works.” Those three words, however inaccurate or accurate you feel they happen to be, captured most of how Apple marketed itself to customers. MacOS was easier to use. The iPhone and iMac were designed to work together. Apple hardware was a consolidated, discrete ecosystem, with fewer choices but better integration of its various components. And while you may not have found this argument particularly appealing, there was truth to it. Apple built routers and peripherals that were designed to interface with its own software and platforms in ways that other companies rarely matched. That argument seems much less potent now than it did in the past. Apple is leaving the peripheral business (apart from dongles, natch) and its clearly not putting the resources into macOS development that it once did. The latest MacBook and MacBook Pro don’t ‘just work’ unless you’ve got a varying number of dongles to hook up. In the event the company does refresh the Mac Pro, everyone who shucked out for Thunderbolt 2 adapters so they could plug non-Thunderbolt peripherals into the system is going to need to buy Thunderbolt 3 adapters for their Thunderbolt 2-to-USB (or what have you) adapters so they can continue to use their hardware. It’s not very Mac-like, when you get right down to it. In fact, it’s precisely the kind of inelegant-but-functional arrangement I associate with PCs. There’s another answer to this issue, though — one that has nothing to do with Tim Cook or Steve Jobs and everything to do with the evolution of the PC and smartphone ecosystems. In retrospect, it’s clear that the iPod, iPhone, and touchscreen interfaces arrived during the last great hurrah of Moore’s Law, at a time when process node scaling and multi-core products were still delivering rapid improvements. The original iPhone in 2007 happened because it became possible for a capacitive touchscreen device to happen. Steve Jobs and Apple still deserve credit for the idea, but the idea only worked because technology had advanced to the point that it could be made to work. Such inflection points are rare — one could argue that we’ve only had a handful throughout the entire history of computing. The first computers relied on a non-realtime batch interface, followed by command-line interfaces that incorporated video terminals and keyboards. The addition of the mouse and GUI are significant enough to deserve their own separate classification, followed by the rise of capacitive touchscreens since 2007. In 72 years (1945 – 2016) we’ve had four of these transitions, and Steve Jobs’ career happened to fall at a time when he could make significant contributions to both. In the end, it scarcely matters. However loyal Apple customers may be in the short term, they’ll inevitably leave the platform if Tim Cook doesn’t give them reason to stay. 2016 was a distinct let-down in this regard, and 2017 isn’t looking much better if the Bloomberg report is right.

Digital How Much Did Wacom’s MobileStudio Pro Impress This Traditional Cartoonist? He called himself a "Luddite" from the start By Brady Dale • 12/21/16 8:11am Indy comic artist Evan Dahm doesn’t seem so sure. Brady Dale for Observer There is a fierce divide in the comics community between people who draw using pencil and paper and people who use different kinds of tablets to make artwork that doesn’t touch a piece of paper until someone prints it out. These days, basically everyone uses some level of computer retouching in their drawing process, but there are still many purists who insist on doing the lion’s share of their drawing using pencil, ink and paper. Some only do their basic line work in ink and then add heavy blacks, colors and shading later in Photoshop, but there are still artists who go so far as to do their coloring by hand. So, when Wacom asked us to have a look at the latest version of the company’s MobileStudio Pro, we invited comic artist Evan Dahm to join us in checking out the new device. Dahm publishes all of his work for free as webcomics, but the self-described “Luddite” draws the strips by hand and insists his comics have always been intended to be seen as printed books. Dahm just announced a book deal with First Second to make Island Book, about a young girl in search of a monster. It marks the first time Dahm will let someone else publish one of his stories. We previously covered Box Brown’s cartoon history of the game Tetris, from the same imprint of Macmillan Publishers. Wacom MobileStudio Pro Courtesy of Wacom We met up with Dahm and the Wacom team at a Think Coffee near Washington Square Park. We turned the tablet over to Dahm while we discussed the device itself with the company’s Douglas Little.. The MobileStudio is distinct from Wacom’s more longstanding line of pen displays, the Cintiq. A Cintiq is an interactive display. Like a computer screen, it lets the user actually see an image made by the computer. It’s an interactive display so that the artist can draw on the screen and see their lines right in front of them. Cintiqs need a computer to work, however. The MobileStudio does not need another computer (though it can be used that way). It is a whole computer, running Windows 10. The lightest device currently available in the Wacom store has a 13″ display, with an Intel Core i7 processor, 512 GB of storage and 64 GB of RAM. It costs $2,499.95. The new device has dramatically increased its accuracy and sensitivity, according to Little. It has enough power to run any of the graphics software that artists might favor. One of its most interesting features is a 3D camera, allowing creators to capture real objects and use them as the basis for three-dimensional designs, whether that’s for making objects in digital forms, architectural elements or manufacturing designs. Evan Dahm doodles up a sort of head. See the space between the line and the tip of the pen? Little highlighted how the device has updated what Wacom refers to as “optical bonding.” When creators use a Cintiq or a MobileStudio, the tip of the stylus touches a different place than where the line appears because there is a gap between the glass users touch and the LCD. This difference is visible from the perspective of the drawing above, but the gap doesn’t look nearly so stark from the perspective of the person holding the pen. Dahm said that he’d been bothered by that gap when trying out Cintiqs in the past, but “I do not see that here,” he told us. “It does have the feel like you are actually on the paper,” Dahm said. Wacom pens can track much more than where the pen touches the tablet. “Our pens record X and Y axis, pressure, rotation and tilt,” Little explained. These allow artists to create different effects. Imagine, for example, a brush tool that makes concentrated color at the center but fades out at the edges. Tracking rotation allows the artist to make swirling effects with their line. SEE ALSO: Webcomic artists’ strategies have changed with the internet. As we were discussing the pen’s interaction with the screen, Dahm discovered that he could move the page with his figners, spin it around and zoom in and out. “I love that you can use your hands on it,” he said. Little added that it often takes artists a few days of work to become familiar with how to make the software do what they want, “but that’s when you hit a wall and say, ‘This is really cool,'” he said. Dahm made the test drawings seen to the left. He tried different tools and made objects or creatures that the tools suggested. You can see everything from scribbles, to figures, to structures to ambiguous experiments with volume. Evan Dahm’s creations with the MobileStudio Pro. The simple figure in the top center with a halo is Dahm’s character Rice Boy. Evan Dahm Still, Dahm said he still prefers the messiness of paper. The random, emergent effects that can be created by a real pen’s interaction with a material that is, at a microscopic level, lots of tiny fibers. “In order to introduce that messiness” into an all-digital process, Dahm said, “it’s another step.” One of the devices selling points, from the Wacom’s perspective, was that an artist cannot really make a mistake. Everything is completely fixable. Dahm seemed to feel that the mistakes themselves are part of his process. As a full time cartoonist, he completes about two pages per week, working from his home office in Brooklyn. While he usually has a couple projects going at the same time, he’s halfway through his third book of his four volume storyline, Vattu. He gives away his comics for free online. “I would have no audience if I didn’t do that,” he told us. Though just under 300 fans support his work on Patreon, he makes his living primarily off of book sales. “The book is the ultimate format and the way I am most proud of presenting the story,” he said. Dahm makes epic comics. His first graphic novel, Rice Boy, ran to 460 pages. That’s a lot of scanning. Dahm doesn’t use a large format scanner, either, so he has to scan each page in parts and stitch them back together in Photoshop, but he says he has those chores so ingrained into his process at this point that he hardly notices it. He does his coloring digitally, but even after trying out Wacom’s latest version with the improved paper simulation, Dahm can’t see himself switching to an all digital process. “I would have to change how I think too much,” he said.

While none of these tech executives signed any #NeverTrump pledges, they also made no move to endorse him during the campaign and some expressed distinct unease over Trump’s views. That could lead to some edgy moments — so could the real policy differences between Trump and these tech leaders. What they should say to Trump View photos Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore The cast of characters includes Alphabet, Inc., (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Larry Page and Chairman Eric Schmidt, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, Oracle (ORCL) CEO Safra Catz and Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. With no detailed agenda set beyond a broad focus on jobs—and with few concrete tech-policy goals announced by Trump—the summit attendees might as well start by telling Trump to his face why they still oppose some of the tech-related stances he took during the campaign. No, Mr. President-Elect, they should say: You can’t order parts of the internet closed up when it was designed to route around such interruptions. No, you can’t demand that tech companies ship secure encryption that also supports back-door access to law-enforcement authorities. These C-suite types could soften the last blow by noting that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton waffled quite a bit about encryption, giving Trump a chance to look decisive on the issue now. They should offer their assistance with cybersecurity in general. The recent history of hacks into both government and political organizations—some of which the CIA now thinks were done by the Russian government to hurt Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton— shows the public sector needs the help. At the same time, the tech execs ought to take the opportunity to say they will not help the government build any registries of religious or ethnic minorities—a task that some of their employees have already pledged to resist. But I fear they won’t: When The Intercept asked Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, Twitter (TWTR), and government contractors Booz Allen Hamilton, CGI and SRA International if they would refuse to develop a registry of Muslims, only Twitter said no. (The others didn’t respond or declined to comment on the issue.) And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has yet to be reported to be on the guest list for this get-together. Dorsey would also be the best person to tell Trump directly that sharing conspiracy theories and punching down on his favorite social network have consequences. What Trump should say to them View photos Donald Trump. AP Photo/Evan VucciMore By most accounts, Trump wants to spend this afternoon talking about creating jobs. That’s a discussion we need—the tech industry has both created and destroyed jobs in vast numbers, and the numbers haven’t balanced out evenly in many cities and states across the US. Trump not only can cut executives off when they start warbling on about “disruption” as a good in its own right, but he’d also probably enjoy it. Read More And after months of campaigning against shipping jobs overseas, Trump also has the standing to ask when the last time any of these companies didn’t have outsourcing manufacturing as a default setting. (Yes, Trump’s own businesses have done the same thing, but an inconsistency between his words and deeds hasn’t quieted Trump before; he might as well make the most of it.) Amazon’s Bezos may get some particularly direct questioning, and not just because he owns The Washington Post. Amazon initiatives like the no-cashiers Amazon Go retail prototype and Prime Air drone delivery of packages suggest a particularly intense focus on getting human labor out of the loop. Tech executives do have good stories to tell about generating employment and what the government can do help. For instance, IBM’s Rometty wrote in a USA Today op-ed that she will urge Trump to put more government funding into retraining workers for the skilled jobs her company has trouble filling. Given Trump’s habit of denouncing environmental regulations, the jobs part of the discussion looks to be their best shot to talk up the green-energy opportunities they’ve created by trying to drive data-center costs as low as possible. The role of independent workers who find customers on platforms like Uber and Airbnb got too little attention during the campaign, but Trump would do well to ask what regulations hinder or help the “gig economy.” Inconveniently enough, Uber’s Travis Kalanick and Airbnb’s Brian Chesky are both overseas this week. But Kalanick will begin advising Trump, the Washington Post’s Brian Fung reported. Other concerns: copyrights, patents, taxes We know Trump resents Chinese copying of intellectual property, so it’s a safe bet he’ll ask these tech executives what they’d like to see done about companies overseas violating US copyrights and patents to sell copycat products. I hope Trump’s guests remind him of the corrosive role played inside the US by a different sort of intellectual-property theft: “patent trolls” who threaten businesses and even their customers with litigation over generic patents that shouldn’t have been issued in the first place. Finally, Trump can take on the increasingly elaborate accounting games Big Tech plays to stash income overseas in a way that few other politicians could. Today’s his chance to say: “Look, we all try to chisel away at our tax bills—but you make me look like an amateur. Let’s cut out the BS here.” That would be a welcome departure from business as usual. But it might not happen. None of what I’ve suggested may happen. With Trump, it remains difficult to know what he’s going to say until he opens his mouth. Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS By Joel Hruska on December 21, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Apple’s recent MacBook Pro updates and “courageous” iPhone 7 have proven to be controversial, and a recent pair of news items highlights how much pent-up frustration is aimed at the device manufacturer. First, Tim Cook made several posts to an Apple employee bulletin board, detailing Apple’s thinking on thinking on both desktops and the intersection between hardware and software design. Cook writes: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that… From a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can. That’s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it’s something that we look for in new employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook. A brand new report from Bloomberg offers an interesting counterweight to Cook’s confidence. According to that investigation, Apple has made a number of strategic decisions that took emphasis away from the Mac design teams. The software team has been reorganized, such that a dedicated macOS team no longer exists and most of the software engineers at Apple are iOS first, Mac second. Hardware engineers are now asked to work on multiple projects at once, or to develop multiple versions of a potential product simultaneously. For example, Apple engineers working on the 2016 MacBook update reportedly wanted to add a second USB-C port and Touch ID support, according to the report. Instead, Apple pushed out a slightly iteration of the same platform and a new “rose gold” color. Engineers working on Mac hardware no longer command the same attention from Jony Ive, the report said, and the appetite for leapfrogging the competition with a more daring approach to technology doesn’t always pay dividends — apparently Apple intended to introduce new battery technology with the MacBook Pro, but unspecified problems killed that option. The Bloomberg report concludes on this note: “Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.” Apple’s innovation decline Part of the problem Apple is facing is straightforward: CPUs haven’t really scaled since 2013. I discussed this last August, but it bears repeating. The image below shows the CPUs Apple currently sells in the three-year-old Mac Pro as compared with the most recent chips available from Intel: Each 2013-era chip is contrasted with its 2016 equivalent. Now, the one thing Apple could do is introduce some high core-count chips that weren’t really available in 2013. Back then, the Xeon E5v2 family topped out at 12 cores; modern CPUs in the E5v4 family top out at 22 cores within the same 135W TDP. But that option carries a hefty frequency penalty: The 12-core E5-2697v2 has a base clock of 2.7GHz and a boost clock of 3.5GHz. The 22-core E5-4699v4 has a 2.2GHz base frequency and a 3GHz boost clock. In other words, if your workload is embarrassingly parallel and can easily scale above 12 threads, the E5-4699v4 is a better option. If it doesn’t — or if you can’t afford the $7,000 price tag Intel has hung on the chip — you won’t see benefits. The GPU market is a markedly different story. AMD’s Polaris refresh would be a good fit for the iMac or even potentially lower-end variants of the Mac Pro, while Vega should address the Mac Pro market head-on (and of course, Nvidia has its own lineup of GPUs, should Apple be interested). Either way, the GPUs baked into current Mac systems are quite old. Apple has never put graphics front-and-center, and it failed to follow up on the graphics-centric argument it made for the Mac Pro. Instead of investing in OpenGL or OpenCL (macOS still only supports OCL 1.2, despite OCL 2.0 now being widely available), Apple has doubled-down on Metal, its own custom iOS API that it also backported to macOS. But major companies like Adobe, which do make use of GPU acceleration, have only begun to add Metal support and it’s not fully baked yet. But I don’t think the issues Apple is facing with macOS and its various Mac systems are simply a matter of lackluster hardware cycles. Apple used to present buyers with a very simple argument: “It just works.” Those three words, however inaccurate or accurate you feel they happen to be, captured most of how Apple marketed itself to customers. MacOS was easier to use. The iPhone and iMac were designed to work together. Apple hardware was a consolidated, discrete ecosystem, with fewer choices but better integration of its various components. And while you may not have found this argument particularly appealing, there was truth to it. Apple built routers and peripherals that were designed to interface with its own software and platforms in ways that other companies rarely matched. That argument seems much less potent now than it did in the past. Apple is leaving the peripheral business (apart from dongles, natch) and its clearly not putting the resources into macOS development that it once did. The latest MacBook and MacBook Pro don’t ‘just work’ unless you’ve got a varying number of dongles to hook up. In the event the company does refresh the Mac Pro, everyone who shucked out for Thunderbolt 2 adapters so they could plug non-Thunderbolt peripherals into the system is going to need to buy Thunderbolt 3 adapters for their Thunderbolt 2-to-USB (or what have you) adapters so they can continue to use their hardware. It’s not very Mac-like, when you get right down to it. In fact, it’s precisely the kind of inelegant-but-functional arrangement I associate with PCs. There’s another answer to this issue, though — one that has nothing to do with Tim Cook or Steve Jobs and everything to do with the evolution of the PC and smartphone ecosystems. In retrospect, it’s clear that the iPod, iPhone, and touchscreen interfaces arrived during the last great hurrah of Moore’s Law, at a time when process node scaling and multi-core products were still delivering rapid improvements. The original iPhone in 2007 happened because it became possible for a capacitive touchscreen device to happen. Steve Jobs and Apple still deserve credit for the idea, but the idea only worked because technology had advanced to the point that it could be made to work. Such inflection points are rare — one could argue that we’ve only had a handful throughout the entire history of computing. The first computers relied on a non-realtime batch interface, followed by command-line interfaces that incorporated video terminals and keyboards. The addition of the mouse and GUI are significant enough to deserve their own separate classification, followed by the rise of capacitive touchscreens since 2007. In 72 years (1945 – 2016) we’ve had four of these transitions, and Steve Jobs’ career happened to fall at a time when he could make significant contributions to both. In the end, it scarcely matters. However loyal Apple customers may be in the short term, they’ll inevitably leave the platform if Tim Cook doesn’t give them reason to stay. 2016 was a distinct let-down in this regard, and 2017 isn’t looking much better if the Bloomberg report is right.

But in the background, self-driving cars started to gain steam. Automakers, tech companies and startups are all racing to develop autonomous technology. Even governments — generally behind the curve on technology — are getting involved. The money, brainpower and time poured into autonomy will likely spur huge changes in how we live. There’s no consensus for when autonomous vehicles will go mainstream, but don’t be surprised if they’re the biggest story of the year before long. 2016 kicked off with GM spending $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation, a startup developing self-driving technology. In August, Uber spent a reported $680 million on self-driving truck startup Otto, which was only eight months old. This fall brought the second biggest tech acquisition in history — Qualcomm’s $39 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors. There was a familiar theme behind the news: Qualcomm needed a path into making chips for autonomous vehicles. We saw other examples of the excitement for chips that power self-driving cars. The stock price of NVIDIA, which makes critical hardware for autonomous vehicles, more than tripled during 2016. Industry giant Intel said in November it would invest $250 million in autonomous driving, including developing chips and software to power the cars. The year saw a lot more than money being thrown around, and grand proclamations of an automated future happened nearly every week. Companies also begin to let average people ride in self-driving cars. This fall, Uber began letting customers in Pittsburgh and San Francisco hail a ride in a self-driving Volvo. NuTonomy, a Boston startup, started offering rides in Singapore. The cars operate with test drivers present, so that they can take over the vehicle if it malfunctions. Perhaps the boldest move of all came from Tesla. In October Tesla announced that all of its new vehicles now had the hardware to drive fully autonomously. All that’s left is developing the software. The strategy lets Tesla collect data from its cars, which is then used to train the cars to drive themselves. No one else in the industry is close to offering such a car. It was a year in which storied automakers embraced radically different business models. In May, GM said it would test self-driving taxis with Lyft. And Ford said it would deploy its own self-driving cars in a ride-sharing service in 2021. Google, a company that’s long been at the forefront of autonomous cars, doubled the number of cities it’s testing in to four. In December, it spun off its self-driving car project as Waymo, an independent company under the umbrella of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Its cars drove over a million miles autonomously in 2016. One big question has been if government regulators will allow self-driving vehicles on roads. The U.S. federal government offered a warm welcome to autonomous cars in September, when it released guidelines for self-driving vehicles. The United Arab Emirates went farther, calling for 25% of residents to use self-driving vehicles by 2030. It’s unclear if the Trump administration will continue to be so receptive to autonomous vehicles, which are expected to imperil many jobs of working class Americans. In California, Uber clashed with the DMV over whether it needs permits to operate self-driving vehicles in the state. The DMV is expected to take legal action against Uber. Of course, Uber could operate without any trouble if it applied for the permits and shared safety data with the government. Despite these hiccups, regulators are largely on board with self-driving technology. But a big question remains — are Americans ready to actually ride in self-driving vehicles? An AAA survey this spring found that three in four Americans are scared to ride in a self-driving car. Programs such as Uber’s, which let customers take a brief ride in a self-driving car, are a way to ease the public into the future. In the coming years, we’ll see just how many of us will actually give up our keys. 2016: The year in supercars Apple AirPods review: Do they actually stay in your ears?

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop System Builders News 5 Dell updates XPS 15 laptop with Kaby Lake CPU and Pascal GPU by Mark Tyson on 21 December 2016, 13:31 Tags: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcih Add to My Vault: Dell will soon update its sleek XPS 15 laptop. The high performance new Dell XPS 15 9560 laptop will be able to be configured to pack a 15.6-inch Ultra HD 4K screen, an Intel Kaby Lake processor up to and including the Core i7-7700HQ, and discrete graphics courtesy of the Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU. The new laptop was spotted by VideoCardz. Visiting the Dell source page, it looks like the details tech referred to on that site have since been taken down. That is likely because Dell listed them by mistake "as GTX 1050 notebooks are expected to be shown at CES 2017," VideoCardz reminds us. Key specifications of the new Dell XPS 15 9650 are as follows: A 15-inch Ultra HD (3840×2160) screen - lower res screens are likely in the options. An Intel Kaby Lake (7th Gen) CPU, with a choice between the i3-7100HQ, i5-7300HQ, or i7-7700HQ processors. Buyers can configure discrete graphics up to and including a 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050. As GTX 1050 for mobile PCs hasn't been officially unveiled we don't have any concrete indication of the clock speeds and memory speeds of these GP107 powered components. If you are interested in the kind of performance Dell's new XPS 15 laptop might approach in various scenarios it is probably worth a look over the trio of GTX 1050 reviews published by HEXUS a month or two back. On availability and pricing; Dell should be officially launching this laptop during or shortly after CES 2017. Earlier generation XPS 15 laptops (with discrete Nvidia GTX 960M graphics) are priced between £1,199 and £1,749 depending upon processor, storage, screen, and memory options.

While Zenbo clearly has a less than human form, Asus has anthropomorphized it to some extent, giving it a friendly - or creepy; YMMV - face on its touchscreen, along with a child-like voice. Today, Asus announced that Zenbo will go on sale in the company's home market of Taiwan on January 1, although stock will be limited at first. The device, which is powered by Intel, will come in two configurations: A standard package with 32GB storage, priced at $19,900 TWD (around $620 USD) A higher-end model with 128GB storage and a self-charging dock, priced at $24,900 TWD (roughly $780 USD) Zenbo offers a wide range of functions, some of which were highlighted at Asus' local launch event today. As Engadget reports, a few had previously been revealed, but there are some new additions too. New voice commands for services such as ordering food, booking a car, online shopping, gaming, and more New child-friendly features, including games and story-telling, along with simple tools to let kids as young as five years old program Zenbo's movements with basic logic Remote assistance and tech support Home surveillance Human fall-detection in conjunction with the Asus ZenWatch 3 Emergency video call functionality, enabling users to quickly contact emergency services, allowing officials to visually assess the situation Asus hasn't yet announced plans to offer Zenbo internationally.

Just a distraction from the real story Rex Moore, for The Motley Fool 9:05 a.m. EST December 21, 2016 Story provided and presented by Motley Fool Self-driving cars have the potential to be a big market, but this could be even bigger. (Photo: The Motley Fool) You probably heard this: Billionaire Elon Musk just came up with this crazy idea that all his Tesla electric cars will soon be self-driving. Yes, Musk is a genuine genius and I’m a huge believer in where Tesla is steering the entire auto industry. But I have never seen so many people get so excited about a single peach while ignoring the entire orchard. All of the talking heads in the media go on and on about Tesla, but they’re not telling you the really BIG story behind it all. It’s the giant prize that Tesla and hundreds of other companies are chasing. And before you ask, no… it’s not self-driving cars. Self-driving cars could be almost insignificant compared to this new technology. Consider that the global self-driving market is supposed to reach $42 billion by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group. But the tech I’m talking about? Cisco believes it will be a $19 trillion market before 2025. That’s 452 times bigger than self-driving cars! And as huge as that number is, consulting firm Accenture says 87% of consumers don’t even understand what this technology is. What an opportunity that presents! It’s going to be so big that companies like Cisco and Intel are budgeting billions to be a part of it. Even stodgy old General Electric is impressed… it sees an opportunity bigger than the entire economy of China! But again, 87% of consumers don’t yet understand what it is. 7 out of 8 people you see walking down the street have never even heard of it. And we believe that presents a huge opportunity for us individual investors, especially if we get in before the crowd. But that crowd may be just around the corner… I’ve already seen this technology being pitched on ABC’s Shark Tank show, and one of the investors on there went gung-ho for it by making one of the biggest investments in the show’s history. So, the masses will soon be catching on as this tech gets more and more popular. And I suspect when they do, they’ll be focusing on obvious names… like Cisco and Intel… as they look for their share of the pie. But, one renegade investor in Virginia is quietly recommending shares in a few not-so-obvious under-the-radar companies BEFORE this technology really goes mainstream. Think about how many amazing technologies you've watched soar to new heights while you kick yourself thinking, "I knew about that before everyone was talking about it, but I just sat on my hands." Don't let that happen again. This time, it should be your family telling you, "I can't believe you knew about and invested in that technology so early on." Heck, not long ago, I saw it featured on the show Shark Tank. Click here to gain instant access to this video. It’s free to you! So click here before every other Shark starts buying and so you don’t risk getting left behind. Rex Moore owns no shares in the companies mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this s3 Object Storage Software Gluster techie shows off 'MySQL of object storage' Minio projects Github star count has it beating Ceph and Swift 21 Dec 2016 at 14:50, Chris Mellor Backgrounder Minio and its µServer were first described by El Reg in December a year ago. Now we have had a closer look, courtesy of a press tour to Silicon Valley earlier this month. The basic product comes as three software items: Open source µServer Open Source Client Software development kit The µServer is a lightweight piece of code, written in Go, that runs as VM or in a container on on-premises COTS servers and storage, and provisions object storage as containers with an S3 access protocol; S3 being the near-enough de facto object storage access protocol these days. It is hardware-agnostic and positioned as a sort-of MySQL of object storage, with S3 being the analogous SQL of object storage. A distributed version enables the pooling of multiple nodes. Minio µServer supports various types of drive media and configurations; NVMe/SSD, SAS/SATA HDD, HGST Open Ethernet drive, RAID and JBOD configurations. It has reference hardware arrangements with Cisco, Intel, Quanta Grid and Supermicro. For example, an OCP-compliant D512B-2U from Quanta Grid involves a 2U chassis from Quanta with dual E5-2600v3 CPUs and 12 x 3.5-inch drive bays. The SMC 1U 5018A-AR12L is an Atom-powered system with 12 x 3.5-inch drive bays. As described by Minio the Client “provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage service (AWS Signature v2 and v4).” It runs on GNU/Linux, Windows, OS X, Solaris/Illumos and FreeBSD. Minio was co-founded by Anand Babu (AB) Periasamy and Garima Kapoor in 2014 and has a recorded $3.3m in seed funding, though it might be more. This comes from three VCs: General Catalyst Partners, Nexus Venture Partners and Index Ventures, and some nine angel funders, who include Mark Leslie and Jerry Yang. Before Minio, Periasamy was the co-founder and CTO at Gluster (June 2005 - October 2011) and joined Red Hat in the CTO office, when Red Hat bought Gluster for $136m in October 2011, staying until November 2014. There is a team of 16 engineers with no managers, and Periasamy running the show. He talks extremely fast. Listening to him pitch his company and its software, you realise the old corporate IT development type certainties just don't exist. DevOps, S3, Docker and GitHub is the world he knows. Minio founder and CEO AB Periasamy You could run Minio on Amazon’s EC2 or other public clouds. Minio tracks its downloads and Periasamy said: “More than 90 per cent of our downloads are happening on Docker. We provision object storage as containers. Minio is involved as a service.” Minio and Github He claims the old models of block storage and file storage are all going away. MongoDB andMySQL use simple key:value storage. Developers are familiar with it and looking for S3 storage, not object storage per se. Periasamy says that there are no knobs to turn and everything is dead simple. The object storage becomes part of an application’s code stack. Periasamy says: “Where does Minio fit? We need a scale where our data footprint is comparable to Amazon. That's where we'll survive or get crushed. … We have to be critical part of our customer's structure and then they'll pay us. … I don't want to be in the infrastructure business; that's a race to zero.” There is a Minio community centred around its Github presence, with 113 committers, 643 community members, and 6,000+ Github stars; “star" is a "Like" in the Github developer world. Minio Github star count versus Ceph and Swift. The download trends show exponential growth, and Periasamy talked of 300,000 Docker pulls. He says: ”We are now as big as Amazon when it comes to S3.” The team appear to be in tune with developers and push community values quite strongly. We asked Periasamy about Minio getting income from customers. He blithely replied: “Getting paid? At million dollar checks it starts to become reasonable for us. We don't want small business. It's a distraction. Let it go. We want growth.” He said he still has half his seed funding in the bank. Minio’s plan Minio has a phase 1 and phase 2 development plan. Phase 1’s goal is to lead in open source object storage. It involves providing Minio µServer and Client software and an SDK. Major software features include: Erasure coding over 16 drives (8+8) Bitrot protection through checksums Lambda functions triggered by events Replication Auto-expiry Minio Reed-Solomon-based erasure code runs in-box or across boxes. Over 16 drives there are 8 for data and 8 for parity. Data and parity blocks are sharded across the drives. Half the 16 drives could die and you're okay. Users can replicate from Minio to S3 Amazon or Google Cloud Storage (via S3) targets. You can continuously mirror between any S3-compatible storage service. Minio Mirror does a full scan and transfer first and then sends updates. Phase 1 started in 2015 and ends at the end of 2016. Phase 2 runs from 2017 to 2018 and its overall aim is to accelerate object storage adoption. It includes a Minio X product and a deep learning engine. Minio X Periasamy says: “The value of the data is many times more than the storage.” He thinks a killer app is to be able to search within unstructured data, like images, using deep learning-generated metadata. The idea is for the system to respond to queries such as: ”Find a blue coffee mug.” The metadata for a blue coffee mug could be viewed as a kind of semantic hash. This by the way, as we understand it, is currently impossible. Machines could then recognise coffee mugs in photos with no humans in the loop. In other words Minio X will generate and provide object content metadata, such as descriptions of elements in an image. Hang on, are they looking to kill image CAPTCHAs? Minio X image metadata generation – the theory anyway. Click image for a more detailed look. +Comment At this point we began to find it hard to be on the same planet. This is a guy who takes in $10m or so seed funding to build an S3-compatible object storage server, which he then open-sources. He’ll take in million dollar checks from large enterprises who like Minio for some reason, and then go off and build a deep learning facility to search inside objects. He's a nice guy and talks at lightning speed, and we’re left thinking he’s either a genius or or a speed-talking fantasist. Given the Gluster and Red Hat background, storage desk tends to think its the former.

Keep up with Marley here. @MarleyLive Innovation Specialist@MarleyLive WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement This past month, I was invited to Stockholm to share a keynote presentation on the trends culminating towards a smarter world. The event, named JAUNT, was the first chapter in a series of innovation hackathons hosted by Stockholm-based innovation agency NINE. The focus of this event was smart paper, which I find to be a rising star in the IoT smart objects ecosystem since its origins are truly analogue. This event triggered me to dive deeper into the concept of smart paper and its applications in a business context. Smart paper is more than just a tricked-out version of an old school item. Rather, the hardware that can be incorporated into smart paper will allow businesses to engage on a more integrated level. Smart paper will allow interactions, information and content to be human-led and technology-supported, leading to better experiences both internally and consumer facing. 1) Never appear tied to technology devices in meetings again Paper in the traditional sense is most commonly associated with sharing information: contracts, notes, research papers, etc. Sharing information is the basis for our society thriving and the way in which we communicate has evolved at a rapid pace since the wide-swept adoption of the personal computer. With this new digital form of communication (i.e. SMS, social media, online forums) has come a resurgence of the analogue. People are now craving tactile and human experiences. Moleskine's Smart Writing Set is a seamless execution of digital meeting analogue in the realm of smart paper. The three-tiered product includes the Moleskine Paper Tablet, the Moleskine Pen+ and the Moleskine Notes App. These components all work together to allow the user to document text and sketches by hand - on paper - and translate in real-time into an image, vector or text file that can be shared instantaneously. This digital-meets-analogue technology allows for a more human experience in meetings, replacing the somewhat clunky and disengaging experience of typing notes on an open laptop or staring down at your phone. The ability to directly share individual handwritten notes also allows for non-linear thinking and sketching, allowing for more flexibility in methods of capturing and communicating new ideas. 2) Businesses will be able to track their physical products more securely As technology hardware becomes exponentially more compact and cheaper, the number of objects that can be integrated with hardware will increase. In the concern of technologically savvy paper, the hardware enabling services will be interwoven into the paper, making the paper material itself "smart." One of the latest technologies that has the capability to do this is Laser Enabled Advanced Packaging (LEAP), developed by scientists from North Dakota State University. By harnessing lasers in this new process, RFID chips are thinned down enough to be transferred into material as thin as paper money. These researchers point to this technology serving the banking sector, providing banks a secure way to identify counterfeit paper money. While the currency of money has been steadily evolving in the digital realm (i.e. bitcoin, online banking, Paypal and Venmo, etc.), this technology can bring back the tactile use case for paper money. Security concerns surrounding virtual money might nudge consumers towards tangible currencies, making the verification of paper money all the more valuable. This compact RFID hardware can be applied across sectors, and the cheaper and more readily available it becomes, the more it will be integrated into everyday products. The software use cases are still up for grabs by brands; however, they will need to be compelling enough for consumers to engage. A brand can apply smart paper technology to validate the authenticity of a product, track a product's production journey, or create an entirely new use case built upon this emerging platform. 3) Consumers will be able to instantaneously download content When it comes to the products themselves, brands are beginning to differentiate against competitors with services and experiences in addition to the base product. This concept is not radical; it is only expanding in scope via technology. Take the apparel industry as an example: paper labels and tags have traditionally been attached to products to share information such as where the clothing was made, the best methods to care for it, and even the story carried with a designer's name or brand heritage. Thanks to technologies like conductive ink and RFID, the communication and expansion of services can be expanded upon digitally. Smashbox cosmetics company executed this by developing a video tutorial unlocking feature on paper cards for their Smashbox ShapeMatters Palette. The product contains "Get the Look" cards printed with service-unlocking conductive ink developed by t-ink. By placing these cards on top of their phone (once open to the website Smashbox.com/ShapeMattersPalette), the consumer is directly connected to demo videos for Brow, Contour, Highlight and Shadow applications. As the ultimate physical and digital convergence, smart paper is perhaps the most analogue-gone-high-tech concept being explored to date. While more and more communication is occurring through virtual platforms, smart paper could bring a renewed sense of importance to physical goods. Whether companies are using smart paper to communicate more efficiently internally or expand upon the value of their product to customers, the technology is set to make an impact for both businesses and consumers alike.

When Paulina Sliwinska, a fund manager at Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford & Co., made the trip to Silicon Valley looking for the next big thing in technology, she found it -- not in a hot startup run by a 23-year-old whiz kid just out of Stanford, but in a 23-year-old semiconductor maker that’s had the same chief executive officer since its founding. Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp., has won over Sliwinska and many other investors this year with claims that his products, once confined to the niche of computer-gaming machines, are breaking out to become key components of nascent technologies from voice recognition to self-driving cars. Jen-Hsun Huang Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg “He’s so engaging,” said Sliwinska. “Even from this point the opportunities in front of it over the next 10 years are astonishing.” After she met Huang in August, the fund added to its position and is now the 10th-largest holder. The company is the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year, outpacing the No. 2 stock by a multiple of almost three. Under Huang, Nvidia has built itself into the leading supplier of graphics processors, the chips that deliver the ever-more-realistic images that make computer games so immersive and addictive. For most of its history, that’s been a relatively small market, with the much bigger businesses of computer processors and smartphone chips dominated by Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. This year, though, Huang’s longtime belief that the fundamental advantages of his graphics chips would give them a broader role in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has begun to pay off -- and is buoying Nvidia’s earnings. In the third quarter, demand for chips used in data centers and cars helped fuel a 54 percent surge in sales, and profit doubled to a record. That performance was the result of years of investment in the hardware and software aimed at enabling computers and cars to think for themselves, according to Huang. The stock surged 30 percent on Nov. 11, the day after the earnings report. Yet there was no victory lap from the CEO -- his company is going to battle in markets also targeted by famously fierce rivals Intel, whose annual R&D spending is twice Nvidia’s revenue, and Qualcomm, which has the largest cash balance in the chip industry. “The only thing we can guarantee is the velocity with which we innovate,” Huang said in an interview at the time. Nvidia declined to make Huang available for comment for this story. Huang, 53, runs Nvidia like it’s still a startup, making snap decisions and demanding fast execution, according to those who have worked for him. For a semiconductor maker, that’s no small feat: Designing a chip, getting it ready for market and then having it manufactured can take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Chip companies publish road maps that reflect those intricate details, and they build their organizations around it. Decisions on what to make in multibillion-dollar plants requires extensive planning. At Nvidia things can happen a lot faster. In the space of a short meeting hosted by Huang, an executive trying to give an update on progress of a new chip design might find himself silenced as Huang calls an engineer to check on a technical question -- then instantly decide the project’s dead or make the call to head in a different direction. Evangelical Approach Huang has long clung to the belief that graphics chips would play a key role in technological innovation. But past efforts to spread their use, such as in phones, have failed to catch on or taken a lot longer to deliver tangible results. While the annual advent of a new high-end GeForce chip from Nvidia has long been viewed as a gift from above for computer gamers -- many of whom think nothing of paying more for one component than most ordinary users would for a whole computer -- Nvidia as a company had been less revered in general until this year. Its stock has struggled to rise higher than $35 in the 17 years since it first went public. The shares closed just above $105 on Dec. 20. Some investors and analysts who follow Nvidia the most closely have missed that run-up. The reason: they’ve heard Huang’s pitches before -- such as when he was touting the company’s future as a provider of smartphone chips -- and initially wrote off his predictions about artificial intelligence and self-driving cars as no different from previous forays that fizzled. “Jen-Hsun didn’t dial it up or dial it down -- he was just as enthusiastic about the automotive opportunity as he was for Tegra,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners, referring to the company’s mobile phone chip, first announced in 2008. The Tegra line of chips was Nvidia’s attempt to get into smartphones, which Huang correctly pointed out were on the cusp of transforming computing and communication. Yet because he and others underestimated the importance of an integrated cellular connection, Nvidia’s offering failed to win significant business. Unlike other companies that lost out to Qualcomm, Huang didn’t close down the project -- instead Nvidia fielded its own game console, called Shield, as a way to try to create a market for Tegra and showcase its abilities to potential customers. While Shield never challenged the dominance of Xbox or PlayStation, the product led to orders for Tegra from Nintendo Co., which made the chip the heart of one its new game systems. “It was more or less a science project internal to Nvidia, and now Nintendo has adopted it,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “That’s another example of them pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, creating a market and then giving it to their customer.” Little Sleep The CEO gets little sleep, even on holidays, because he stays up late into the night reading everything he can get his hands on that concerns Nvidia and its businesses, no matter the language -- he is fastidious about translations, which he has staff ready to deliver whenever he needs them. While founding Nvidia and building it into the largest maker of graphics chips has made him a billionaire, he still runs the company with the paranoia and drive of someone scared it might fail at any moment, according to those who have worked for him. In public he speaks in soft tones, using careful pauses for emphasis and employing Silicon Valley’s patois to answer specific questions with broad, lofty discussions that contain grand assertions. Within the company, he has little patience for subordinates who aren’t making the grade and will call them to scream whenever he deems it necessary. The way he describes it, Huang has always been fighting the bigger guy. He likes to tell the story of how his Taiwanese parents sent him to be educated at what they thought was a private school in the U.S. when he was a child. The institution in Kentucky turned out to be more of a reform school, where he was one of the smallest guys in a rough environment having to get by on his wits and form alliances with the big kids. Huang’s grown-up bete noire, Intel, is located just across the 101 freeway, which runs the length of California’s Silicon Valley. This other Santa Clara-based chipmaker is also the world’s largest. Analysts who in the past have been unwilling to bet on Huang’s vision and execution have cited Intel’s ability to build other computer functions into its processors as an existential threat to Nvidia. Indeed, Nvidia’s chipset business disappeared almost overnight when Intel decided to build that technology into its products, starting in 2008. Still, Intel has never fielded a graphics chip good enough to persuade high-end computer users to switch from Nvidia. And now Huang’s company is trying to muscle in on the rapidly growing market for chips used in data center servers, Intel’s most profitable business. Data Flood Traditional data centers are stacked with machines powered by Intel’s most expensive server chips, and many would-be competitors have been trying to break Intel’s lock on the market. Now, the flood of information created by connected devices and online services is overwhelming conventional computing’s ability to analyze and put this data to use. Based on work Nvidia has been doing for several years, graphics chips are increasingly being programmed to run artificial intelligence systems that can perform tasks such as recognizing images and speech lightning-fast, without the help of humans. While Intel processors are extremely fast at performing complex operations, they have a limit in terms of their ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time. That’s where graphics chips have started to make inroads with their ability to perform a much larger number of smaller tasks in parallel. Google and Amazon.com Inc. offer graphics-chip-based computing as part of their cloud services. While graphics technology is making headway, the majority of data center work is done by Intel’s microprocessors and there are efforts by suppliers of other types of chips to tailor their less-power-hungry products for the market. For now, investors think Nvidia is leading efforts to provide the main engine for artificial intelligence. “They’re in one of the hottest spaces,” said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager for Synovus Trust Company. “You’d have to put them at the top of the list right now. They seem to be positioned really well.” In its most recent quarter Nvidia’s data center revenue, at $240 million, was up from just $82 million a year earlier. But that’s barely scratching the surface of a market where Intel has more than 99 percent market share in processors. The larger company’s server chip business delivered more than $2 billion in profit on $4.5 billion of sales in its latest quarter. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

While Tegra is used to run entertainment systems, Nvidia has produced more powerful graphics chips to do the work of taking inputs from radar, cameras and other sensors to build an electronic picture of what’s going on around the vehicle. There’s no shortage of competition from other chipmakers, though, and last year Nvidia didn’t make it into the list of top 10 providers of silicon to automakers. One chipmaker that did, NXP Semiconductor NV, last year bought another, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Nvidia’s mobile nemesis, Qualcomm. The Nvidia CEO’s willingness to make rapid changes of direction has already manifested itself in cars. Once famous for his love of Ferraris, Huang is now posting pictures of himself on his driveway surrounded by Teslas. Probably no coincidence: The first new version of his complete computer for self-driving cars was delivered personally to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia’s technology is the basis for Telsa’s next version of its driver-assistance technology.

(AMD) Stock Is STILL a Red-Hot Buy AMD stock is worth buying on any decent dip Dec 21, 2016, 10:28 am EST  |  By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer     View All   Calling 2016 a “good year” for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders would be a considerable understatement. AMD stock is up 305% year-to-date, decisively ending a three-year dry spell. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Too much, too fast? Many would say so, pointing out that sales have been deteriorating since 2011 and the company has booked net losses in each of its past four years. Although the top line perked up a bit in the third quarter, the computer component maker is still regularly in the red. AMD is going to have to pull off some sort of mini-miracle if it’s going to justify the stock’s current price anytime soon. Thing is, it may well have a miracle or two up its sleeve for 2017. Advanced Micro Devices to Rise With Ryzen? It’s a rarity for a technology company’s fortune to be altered by the introduction of a new product. But, this is one of those times. The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016 When Advanced Micro Devices unveiled its new “Zen” microprocessor technology in August, the market was hopeful, but cautious. AMD hasn’t been especially competitive in any market for a while, ceding to rivals like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), and though the specs for Zen looked good, doubts lingered that it would be able to do what it was supposed to do when the architecture was put to its pre-launch test. Those worries, though, may not have been necessary. Zen is shaping up to be everything it was touted to be in front of its commercial debut in the first quarter of 2017. It may be the biggest and most successful launch Advanced Micro Devices has seen in a long, long while. Indeed, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to say Zen may end up saving the company. The processor truly is an engineering marvel. Renamed Ryzen in the meantime, the first entry in the Summit Ridge line of desktop processors are a true 8-core, 16-thread CPU that operates at a minimum of 3.4 GHz. That’s a bit stronger than the most comparable processor from Intel: the Core i7-6900K, which operates at a base frequency of 3.2 GHz. The i7 can be boosted up to 4.0 GHz, and it’s not clear exactly how far the Ryzen can be pushed. It’s likely to be in that 4.0 gigahertz ballpark though, and it’s going to require less power to get there. Ryzen has another dimension owners of AMD stock can get excited about — it’s got its own artificial intelligence technology built in that allows it to operate better. The Neural Net Prediction algorithm remembers which pathway a particular app runs best on, while Smart Prefetch tracks software behavior so it can best prepare the computer to run the program. It will likely be price competitive too. Although no official word had been given, initial estimates peg the processor’s price at between $500 and $600, versus the i7-6900K’s (current) sticker price of just over $1,000. And analysts have taken notice. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently upped the firm’s target on AMD stock to $13, up 22% from its current value of $10.66, explaining: “We’ve argued that AMD’s IP is undervalued and that it is in the midst of a turnaround, and AMD’s demos this week of its new Zen MPU in high-end performance applications reinforce the latter part of this thesis. Our checks continue to indicate AMD’s Zen MPU is being well received in the enthusiast DT channel, and the Asia Cloud Server market.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/12/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-still-red-hot-buy/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 Comments are currently unavailable.

Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. Mark Religioso, a brand manager for the video game publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment, wants more women to be involved in the professional gaming arena known as esports, where players compete in video game tournaments to win thousands of dollars in prize money. So this year, Mr. Religioso began planning “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments, where esports teams consist of one man and one woman. He also began laying the groundwork for a mentoring program to foster interest in esports among women. “These are baby steps so that we can get more women on the team,” he said. “We need to make the scene a welcoming place.” Mr. Religioso’s efforts are one of several recent moves by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports, which is rapidly becoming one of the video game industry’s most visible segments. As more women play video games, the esports industry is starting to focus on getting more of them involved in professional competition to help the effort expand and become mainstream. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Revenue from esports is expected to surpass $1 billion worldwide by 2018, yet the viewership for esports is only 15 percent female, according to the market research firm SuperData. There is little data on the number of women who actually play esports, but anecdotal evidence suggests the figure may be small. Photo Diane Tran at her computer, training for video game competition. Credit Jake Michaels for the New York Times. Efforts to increase diversity in esports go back more than a decade but have started gathering momentum. In 2003, the French esports company Oxent began organizing annual women-only tournaments; 40 teams competed in the 2016 tournament in Paris, an increase of 25 percent over the previous year. Twitch, the Amazon-owned site that livestreams video game play, began hosting Misscliks, a support community for women in gaming, three years ago after some of its founders became dismayed by the lack of women in esports. Twitch also established Inclusivity City, an area for diversity organizations, at its annual convention, TwitchCon, which ran Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 in San Diego. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And this year, apart from Bandai Namco’s efforts, Intel and the esports company ESL partnered to form AnyKey, an advocacy organization that seeks to create support networks and provide opportunities for women in esports. Many women gamers welcome these efforts. With a predominance of professional male players, the culture of the video game industry has long been perceived as misogynistic. Women in esports have frequently faced heckling from teammates and anonymous threats of rape and murder. “It’s an extremely toxic environment for women,” said Stephanie Harvey, 30, who is a top competitor in esports tournaments for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. “To be a woman in esports, you have to have a thick skin.” How effective these efforts will be in drawing more women to esports is uncertain. Although Oxent, which has run the Electronic Sports World Convention for 13 years, has organized women-only tournaments for years for Counter-Strike, there is little evidence that they are encouraging more women to play competitively. Some gamers think the events reinforce the idea that women are not capable of competing with men. Lâm Hua, the head of content at Oxent, said the women-only tournaments were not entirely successful in drawing more women to esports, but after much debate, the company decided that they were “the first step in the grand scheme of women recognition in the sport.” For now, he said, they were “a necessary evil.” Other diversity efforts in esports have focused on normalizing the idea of women in gaming. Anna Prosser Robinson, a programming manager and onscreen personality at Twitch, helped push the company’s diversity initiatives after seeing women rise up, then drop out of esports. “We would see these awesome, compelling women be excited” about esports, she said. “Six months later, they would be gone.” The goal of Misscliks, she said, was to provide support and resources to encourage those women to create a network on Twitch and stay in esports. Ms. Prosser Robinson also helped bring diversity to TwitchCon this year with Inclusivity City, a physical space on the convention floor that hosted several diversity organizations like AnyKey and Hack Harassment, as well as a Smash Sisters tournament for women who play Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. fighting games. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Inclusivity is a core value of our brand,” Chase, a Twitch spokesman who goes by one name, said of the diversity effort at the convention. “It was a success this year and definitely something we could consider for next year.” AnyKey, the creation of Intel and ESL to increase the number of women in esports, focuses on two areas. One is research and discussion of the diversity issue, headed by T. L. Taylor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other is initiatives and solutions, led by Morgan Romine, a former esports player. Photo Coach Erik Stromberg observing his team in a training session. Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. AnyKey organized a women-only esports tournament in March at one of the industry’s largest events, the Intel Extreme Masters competition in Katowice, Poland. Ms. Romine said she saw women-only tournaments as a way to strengthen players’ skills and move them into open competition. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done, giving more women confidence and experience in that space,” she said. Mr. Religioso of Bandai Namco said he began noticing the lack of female esports players at regional esports tournaments last spring, like Final Round in Atlanta and Combo Breaker in Chicago. With the growth in esports, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate interest in the company’s Tekken franchise. Next year, Bandai Namco will release Tekken 7, a one-on-one fighting game that the company hopes will be popular among esports competitors. Women make up about 23 percent of the fan base for the Tekken fighting games, Mr. Religioso said, but few are playing them competitively. Rather than segregate men and women, Mr. Religioso wants them to work together in the “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments. He also wants to introduce Western audiences to the Tekken Girl’s Club, a mentorship program in Japan in which professional players teach women to master the game’s mechanics. Another solution to encourage more women into esports would be to change the way video games are made and marketed. Stephanie Llamas, director of research and insight at SuperData, said women should be participating more on the business side of the industry and developing games with women in mind. “It’s difficult to understand the demographic if you are not part of that demographic,” she said. Correction: December 23, 2016 An article on Thursday about efforts by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports misidentified the city in California where the TwitchCon convention took place this year. It was in San Diego, not in San Francisco. A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Esports Sees Profit in Attracting Female Gamers.

Published time: 20 Dec, 2016 14:07 Get short URL Police stand in front of the truck which ploughed last night into a crowded Christmas market in the German capital Berlin, Germany, December 20, 2016 © Hannibal Hanschke / Reuters While 100 percent security is hard to achieve, it is also ineptitude on the part of the European authorities managing public safety which are to blame for allowing the Berlin Christmas market attack to happen; experts told RT. TrendsBerlin Christmas market attack A truck plowed into a Christmas market in western Berlin on Monday evening killing 12 people and injuring dozens more in what has been called a terrorist attack.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on Tuesday: “There is much we still do not know with sufficient certainty but we must, as things stand now, assume it was a terrorist attack.” She also added it would be hard to bear if it turned out that the “person who committed this act was someone who sought protection and asylum.” Read more No doubt Berlin truck incident was terrorist attack – German Interior Ministry Hugh Bronson, a member of the Berlin parliament for AfD told RT that the tragedy would be followed by further “debate about migration and security will further polarize the society.” “The debate will be more aggressive. And we can prepare for a Christmas which is not exactly what we had hoped for,” he said. According to Bronson, “100 percent security is very difficult to achieve” especially in Europe “where we follow a policy of open borders.” “When there is a large crowd coming together to join and to celebrate and to enjoy each other’s company, it will attract people who want to inflict great harm and who want to create terror,” he told RT. The Berlin attack resembles what occurred in July on Bastille Day in Nice, France, said former FBI agent James Conway who is managing director of Global Intel Strategies. “A Christmas market which is a Christian symbol is a classic target for Islamic jihadists. It is the Christmas season, and there have been a lot of threats in respect to the upcoming Christmas season,” he told RT. Ricardo Baretzky, President of European Center for Information Policy, argues that a lack of competency on the part of the authorities managing public security is to blame for the possibility of such a tragedy and for the security situation to deteriorate during the year. “The problem here is that this is not the information or the intelligence, it is the ability to manage the risk in public spaces. Unless they can manage the risk in public spaces, this will escalate one way or another. Because it is not only about a terror threat as such, but it is also about the present risk situation when you are in public spaces. So, there are a lot of factors; there are a lot of signals and this is very dangerous in a sense that if they can’t manage this, it will escalate,” he told RT. Gregory Copley,editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs, said officials were cautious about releasing the details, and motive for the attack as “it would, and it does reflect badly on the German government’s policy of open borders which has allowed the security situation in Germany to deteriorate badly.” “We’ve also seen injunction from ISIS leaders urging their followers to use vehicles and so on to attack the civilian population. We saw results in Nice earlier this year, we’ve seen similar types of attacks, ostensibly lone-wolf or spontaneous attacks in the US. But with the incitement which comes from jihadist or Islamist leaders,” Copley told RT. Is it possible to prevent such attacks? According to Rania Khalek, independent journalist, it doesn’t matter what authorities are doing when they are trying to avoid this kind of attack as the core reason remains the spread of hateful ideology. “There are so many details that are still unclear, but whenever I do see the attacks targeting the West, all I can think is that for the past several years – the US government, the UK government, and the Gulf States like Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and Qatar have been funding and arming all these different jihadist groups in the Middle East and really empowering this sort of religious extremism and spreading all this hateful ideology and a lot of sectarianism. And you see that coming back and blowing back into the West and particularly in Europe from ISIS-inspired attacks and attacks inspired by Al-Qaeda. Right now, what I see is a bunch of people in the US, especially on the right, blaming Islam like they always do. But there’s absolutely no discussion about the actual hateful ideology that ends up fueling those kinds of attacks,” she told RT. Year of terror: Timeline of attacks in Europe during 2016 https://t.co/O47eV7xCPR— RT (@RT_com) December 20, 2016 There is a larger political, social and economic story here, argues William Robinson, professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Part of that is a “disaster unleashed” by Western governments in the Middle East in the last 15 years. “The problem here is that security measures can only go so far in this type of terrorist attack and in the battle on the one hand between the Western governments and the ire that the Western governments have done, the anger that generated among groups that are prone to turn toward terrorism,” he told RT, adding that the attacks in countries like France and Germany indicate that there was also a lack of security measure being taken by the governments. Another part of the problem, Robinson went on to say, is that “Europe is entering a social, political and economic crisis and upheaval.” That doesn’t help to establish security either, the analyst added. A whole set of measures needs to be applied to improve the situation as “The complete prevention of any of these attacks simply through security measures eventually leads to a police state and the undermining of civil and political rights and freedom,” said Robinson. Radicals “have been trying to hit Berlin for quite some time”, says Jack Rice, former CIA officer and international lawyer. However, in case with Monday’s tragedy, German authorities “have a benefit” because they have a “survivor” – a man who was allegedly steering the truck - and can potentially find out who was behind the attack and why, Rice said.  “The problem that people face is that you can ramp this up, but there’s always a balancing act – you can increase security, you can even increase the powers of the police to try to stop this. But in some ways the more you ramp up some of this, the more you actually may encourage it. It is about trying to figure out how to stop the motivational structure behind this,” he said. Extremists using trucks as opposed to guns or explosives is another challenge security services have now to deal with. “It is different when you are looking for someone with an AK-47, it is different when you are looking for somebody who actually has plastic explosives, when you have something you can look for. At least then you are looking at a very particular chemical signs. What happens when you use something that everybody has? It changes everything,” Rice told RT.

Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by Sean Hollister December 21, 2016 11:29 AM PST @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Strange but true -- when we went looking for a Windows alternative to the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, only one laptop stood out. Right now, the Dell XPS 15 is the only machine with portability and performance to match Apple's largest laptop. Problem is, its CPU and graphics are about to be a year out of date. It looks like that will change at this year's CES in January, though, because Dell just leaked the product page for a new XPS 15 -- one with Intel's unreleased quad-core Kaby Lake CPUs and an unannounced Nvidia graphics chip. According to the listing, which has since been pulled but is mostly archived here (first spotted by VideoCardz.com), the XPS 15 will come with your choice of a new quad-core Intel Core i3-7100HQ, i5-7300HQ or i7-7700HQ processor, optional Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics and an optional fingerprint sensor that can let you log into Windows with a single tap. (Those fingerprint sensors are one of my favorite new laptop features.) We can't say what those new chips are capable of -- they haven't been announced yet, after all -- but if we're lucky that GTX 1050 might support VR. 23 Laptops for every holiday wish list Otherwise, the Dell XPS 15 sounds like it'll be the same excellent machine, with barely there bezels surrounding a beautiful 4K screen and a do-it-all Thunderbolt 3 port for single-cable docking. Plus there's the full-size SD card slot, HDMI and USB ports that the new MacBook Pro ditched, all wrapped up in an aluminum and carbon fiber body that weighs 4 pounds (1.8 kg). To be sure, it's possible the leaked site was inaccurate, and these details could change -- but the new processors, graphics and fingerprint sensor are pretty big things to accidentally add to the page. I'll probably buy one for myself if the price is right come January. Dell didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

Light and Sound Extravaganza to Turn on Gamers In order to deliver the best gaming experience, Elitegroup has focused on optimizing the performance and compatibility of their motherboards. After ceaseless testing and debugging, Z270 LIGHTSABER is finally ready for its debut to satisfy the PC master race. Z270 LIGHTSABER belongs to LEET gaming series, so the research and development team of Elitegroup took gamers’ opinions into account and added LEET Superior Audio II. This crisp audio solution for gamers eliminates electromagnetic interferences through the shortest routing design and isolation of the audio processing corner on the PCB. Moreover, the stereo system grade capacitors contribute to instilling lifelike acoustics. Meanwhile, the embedded amplifiers allow audiophiles to power high impedance headphones. As for the core, the 120db SNR audio chip makes sound localization easier with strong and crisp audio effects. To add icing on the cake for gaming zealots, the LEDs planted within the PCB isolation area flickers in accordance with the bassline. ECS Z270 Lightsaber Optimized Network for Gamers Elitegroup leads the industry with Killer E2500 LAN chips that are dedicated to gaming. Configure the priority of network packets with the new Killer Control Center, and never let your gaming performance be hindered by others who are torrenting or watching YouTube videos. Furthermore, with the exclusive Flash DiGi Power technology which is based on a 14 power phase design, the digital VRM and DURATHON II complement each other, striking the perfect balance between power efficiency and performance, and also resulting in perfect compatibility with Intel Optance technology. Unlocking the full potential of Intel seventh-generation processors, and easily breaking the 3200MHz mark of memory modules. ECS Z270 Lightsaber Perfect Build with High Compatibility Another attraction of CES will be the mini-ITX Z270H4-I motherboard. It’s no secret that the compatibility of the mini-ITX motherboard, heat sink, memory, graphics card, case and other components is the hardest part of building a small system, so the engineers at Elitegroup has designed this motherboard to make the most out of the tiny space. No matter whether users are building with tower fans, memory modules with heat sinks or all sorts of mini-ITX cases, the enhanced compatibility grants users the freedom of choosing whatever components they want. ECS Z270H4-I In the meantime, Elitegroup engineers worked magic to place a native NVME M.2 socket on the backside of the PCB. Besides supporting 2242 / 2260 / 2280 form factors, it is also fully compatible with Intel Optance technology for bringing ridiculously fast file transfer speed. Another M.2 2242 socket may be found on the front side. By installing an 802.11ac 2.0 WiFi module and pairing it with an 802.11ac Triple E wireless router, users may experience the latest MU-MIMMO technology, and never suffer from web traffic, connection timeout or crashes. Miniature Size that Meets Future Needs Despite the compact size of Z270H4-I, it is designed with LEET Superior Audio as well,  providing users low distortion, high definition, and extra smooth sound quality. Plus an S/PDIF interface for connecting your speakers to enjoy the delights of 4K blue-ray. ECS Z270H4-I Over and above, Z270H4-I is packed with USB Type-C, so users may connect their smartphones, tablets or other devices seamlessly, and marvel at the advanced speed of quick charging and data transferring. Moreover, users are able to setup intranet and internet connections simultaneously via the dual GbE LAN design. About ECS ECS, Elitegroup Computer Systems, was established in 1987. In recent years, ECS’s main focus has expanded from motherboards to All-in-One PCs, notebook computers, Mini PC and other mobile products. ECS is strongly committed to developing cutting-edge technology in order to create innovative products under environmentally friendly designs.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | December 20, 2016 -- 21:04 GMT (13:04 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software If you've been a good Linux user this year, Santa has a great new present for you in his bag: Linux Mint 18.1 "Serena." Linux Mint 18.1 is the best desktop available today. Not best "Linux" desktop. Best desktop period. With this long-term support Linux desktop, which is based on Ubuntu 16.04, Linux Mint is better than ever. Since I've already found Linux Mint 18 to be the best desktop out there of any sort, that's saying something. read this ​Microsoft's love affair with Linux deepens After testing the waters for years, Microsoft has launched its first service, Azure Cloud Switch, that's based on Linux. Read More Why? For starters, at long last you can automatically update Linux Mint. In the past, you had to manually replace Mint while keeping your personal files in a home directory located on another partition. Most other Linux distributions enabled you to avoid this problem. Now, Mint has jumped on the the easy upgrade bandwagon as well. To do this, all you need to do is to update your existing Linux Mint installation with the latest patches. Then, simply run (from your Cinnamon or MATE desktop): Update Manager > Edit > Upgrade to Linux Mint 18.1 This feature isn't ready yet for Mint with the KDE or Xfce desktops. It will be available in early 2017. I tried this method myself on my main desktop, an older Dell XPS 8300. This PC has a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and an AMD/ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphic card. The upgrade ran smoothly and flawlessly. I haven't had a single problem with any of my already installed programs. I also really liked Mint's update of its default desktop: Cinnamon. The new Cinnamon 3.2 has many small improvements. For example, the new screensaver has been rewritten from scratch. This has made it both faster and more responsive. It also has a couple of nice new features, such as enabling you to see your battery's status from the screensaver. If you're an Ubuntu Unity desktop fan, you can also now place your panels on the side of the screen. You can now place your panels and menubars on the side of the Linux Mint Cinnamon desktop. As usual, Mint has also updated its default programs. So, for instance, the office suite is now LibreOffice 5.1.4.2. The one major application change is that Mint is dropping the no longer maintained Banshee media player with Rhythmbox. I'm sorry to see Banshee go; it was the good end-user Mono .NET framework Linux program. Without a patch since 2014, however, it was time to drop it. While I'm running Mint on an old, but fast, computer, Mint still runs on old computers you might find at a yard sale. You only need 512MB of RAM to run it, although 1GB is recommended. You can fit Mint on a 10GB hard-drive, although 20GB is recommended. As for a display, you can run it on 1024×768 resolution. On newer systems, with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS, you should have no trouble installing or running Mint. The Mint team reports that you might need to turn off Windows specific Secure Boot, but I haven't had any trouble running Mint side-by-side on my Secure Boot enabled Windows systems. Once more, I find myself really enjoying running Mint. Unlike so many other new and "improved" operating systems -- I'm looking at you Windows 10 Anniversary Update and macOS Sierra -- Linux Mint just keeps working. It doesn't fail the way Windows 10 has been with cumulative upgrades since the Anniversary Update. Instead, it just keeps working. Equally important, Mint doesn't require me to learn anything new to do my same old jobs. Yes, it's new and improved, but I don't have to change my work habits to get its benefits. Other desktop operating designers could learn from Mint. Want to see why I like it so much? You can download Mint today in both 32- and 64-bit versions with either the Cinnamon or MATE desktops.

Linux Workstation/Server Distribution Benchmarks For Winter 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 21 December 2016. Page 1 of 5. 12 Comments The latest for your enjoyment of our year-end comparison articles and benchmarks is a fresh comparison of various workstation/enterprise/server oriented Linux distributions when looking at relevant workloads. Testing for this distribution comparison being done from a Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E system while a desktop-focused Linux desktop comparison for winter 2016 will be posted still before year's end. For this workstation/server-oriented distribution benchmarking, tested for this comparison was Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, CentOS 7 1611, openSUSE Leap 42.2, Debian GNU/Linux 6.8, and Intel Clear Linux 12210. The distributions used were basically those popular in enterprise environments while the EOY2016 Linux desktop distribution comparison will feature more of the common enthusiast/gamer distributions. All of the tests for this article were done with an Intel Core i7 6800K + MSI X99A WORKSTATION + 16GB DDR4 + Samsung 850 EVO 128GB SATA 3.0 SSD + NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X setup. Each system was cleanly installed with the given distribution for testing and best efforts to test each Linux distribution in an "out of the box" configuration for being able to reproduce our results and for being most comparable. If you're new around here, the same hardware was used for testing, the illustrated differences on the system table just come down to how the software/drivers reported different components, such as the CPU scaling driver reporting e.g. boost vs. stock processor frequencies. All of these server/workstation/enterprise oriented tests were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

USB Type-C: What Is It and How Is It Better Than Its Predecessors? USB Type-C will soon be a standard, and there are a few good reasons behind it. By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Thursday, December 22, 2016, 10:05 [IST] While you may have never noticed it, USB and connectivity go hand-in-hand. From desktops to smartphones, as far as connectivity is concerned, USB is the standard. For instance, pick any device lying around your house, and it’s most likely that you’ll at least find one device with USB.  Though it’s been a while since USB received a major update (USB 3.1 in 2013), the technology itself has come a long way since its inception in January 1996. From a massive, single oriented plug to a micro (or even mini), reversible equipment, it sure did improve a lot over time.  Also Read: Does the Position of Fingerprint Scanner on Smartphones Matter? Alongside the USB 3.1, the USB Type-C connector was introduced in the year 2013. We will get back to what a USB Type-C connector is in a moment. But, we are pretty sure you have been hearing the term USB Type-C from smartphone manufacturers (even from the biggies in the industry) very frequently, right? Well, what’s all the fuss about it and how is it better than its predecessors? We are here just to explain that. What is USB Type-C? Developed by USB Implementers Forum, the USB Type-C is just like any other connector (for example Micro-USB) used to transmit power as well as data. It is quite similar to the USB 1.1, USB 2.0, USB 3.0 or the latest USB 3.1, except for the fact that at 10Gbps, it’s twice as fast as USB 3.0 and can be plugged in any orientation — something which had been a major problem with the previous connectors.  The USB Implementers Forum has more than 700 partner companies including Apple, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Intel, and Samsung. Meaning, it’s going to be ubiquitous soon, if not it already is, no matter what device you use — computers, laptops, smartphones, hard drives, flash drives, and much more. Also Read: IFTTT Explained For The Laymen What are the advantages? USB Type-C will soon be a standard on most electronic devices and should eventually replace all the previous standards. The reason behind this is not only the fact that it is the latest standard out there but also because it brings along several advantages that make managing devices much easier. Let’s take a look at a few benefits of USB Type-C here.  Higher transfer speeds: The USB Type-C by default supports USB 3.1 for data transfer, which means its cables offer transfer speeds of 10Gbps, which is double the transfer speed of its predecessor.   Faster charging: The USB Type-C cables offer 20 volts and 5 amps of power in comparison to the 5 volts and 1.8amps of its predecessor. This means it will charge your devices significantly faster, which is welcome by all of us. Can be a headphone jack alternative: Let's get this straight out of the way. Headphone jacks are bulky and restrict smartphone vendors from building slimmer smartphones. Whether people need slimmer devices or not is an argument for another day, but that's not the only reason behind USB Type-C killing the headphone jack.  Also Read: Honor Magic Gleans Its Sorcery From Artificial Intelligence: Here’s What You Should Know The 3.5mm headphone jack dates back to 1960s, and since then, it’s been used only for one thing — transmit sound. On the other hand, unlike the headphone jack, USB Type-C can multi-task.   Reversible: Okay, this is one of the most common and irritating issues with the previous USB standards. You never plug it right the first time as there will always be the second attempt. However, getting rid of this issue, USB Type-C allows you to plug it in any orientation. Can be used to charge Laptops: Like mentioned above, the USB Type-C has higher power available at disposal. As a result, it can be used to charge laptops as well which usually require higher power.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Computers Apple had some daring MacBook features in the works that never saw the light of day Chris Smith @chris_writes December 20th, 2016 at 7:12 PM Share Tweet Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees during an internal Q&A session that the company has “great desktops in our roadmap,” adding that “nobody should worry about that.” Apple updated its MacBook Pro line with a courageous new design but didn’t release any new desktop models. There’s no 2016 iMac, Mac mini, or Mac Pro, and some people speculated that Apple may be looking to ditch desktops from its lineup.

Apparently, the Mac software team doesn’t exist anymore. The software engineering department services iOS first, and macOS later. Mac engineers are also getting less face time with Jony Ive and his design team than they used to.

Apple’s inability to mass-produce Macs in America is also a reason that can affect the Mac Pro’s update cycles. That said, the report reveals various features that have been shelved. The 2016 MacBook Pro was supposed to have a higher capacity pack shaped to the insides of the laptop. But that battery prototype failed a key test, and Apple decided to stick with square cells instead. Recently, Apple had to deal with a battery life issue on the new MacBook Pro, which seems to be fixed for the time being. To fix the battery hardware issue, Apple had to divert engineers from other teams, meaning other Mac models had to wait. A gold MacBook Pro was shelved because the color didn’t look good. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook came with a Lightning connector instead of the USB-C one, but Apple decided to go for the more standard USB-C port instead. Apple tested two distinct 12-inch MacBooks before launching the device in 2015, but the extra workload has lead to launch delays. The 2016 12-inch MacBook model could have featured a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port. However, all we got was faster chips and a pink upgrade. Apple’s engineers are also working on standalone keyboards for the iMac that would feature a Touch Bar screen and a fingerprint reader, but it’s not clear if the product will be launched with a new iMac. As for next year’s MacBook and iMac refreshes, you can expect USB-C ports and AMD graphics on the new iMac and minor speed bumps for the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro.

ROGERS Screenshot from iPhone showing AirPods and case charge levels. - + Apple announced its US$159 (5,700 baht) AirPods at the same time as the iPhone 7, but the Bluetooth-connected device was not made available to customers until last week. There was much online speculation that a problem was found in the production models, so the release was put back. It would have been wrong to release a device with a known problem for a number of obvious reasons. That may also be why the MacBook Pro update was delayed until almost too late. When it became clear that certain Intel chips would not be coming, Apple went with the Skylake processor. I have been happy with the 15-inch MacBook Pro I have been using, but my own 13-inch version arrived on Thursday and I made that my main machine on Friday. When the AirPods were released last Tuesday, delivery was shown as before Christmas. Within two hours several people reported on Twitter that their orders were on the way. Later that evening it was reported that delivery estimates had already slipped to Dec 29. It is now six weeks. Within 12 hours one pair was being offered on eBay for $1590. A few of these were available in Bangkok from Monday (6,900 baht including VAT), but I expect they will be snapped up. I have been using a set since last weekend and am loving them. The demonstration in early September showed how easy it was to set these up. Everyone expects this is Apple hype, but it took me about 30 seconds while I was leaning against a parapet in Siam Paragon. I opened the box and a panel appeared on the iPhone. Done. They were ready to go immediately. What foxed me slightly was the lack of volume control. I tried stroking the sides, which works with my BeoPlay H7 Bluetooth headphones. Instead I have to ask Siri. As I do not use this feature often, it took me a few tries to make her understand, and I do not succeed every time. Critical commands here are "Louder", "Pause" and "Quieter". I also feel self-conscious about apparently speaking to myself in a Bangkok mall. It is just as easy to take the iPhone out of my pocket. The double-tap can be changed to Play/Pause or to Off, but as there is more potential with Siri, I am going to stick with that (her?) for the time being. That instant pairing uses the newly developed W1 chip in the AirPods. Another trick was apparent when I arrived home. Each iOS device I picked up already showed the AirPods ready to go. My 13-inch MacBook Pro lagged slightly. Whether it was because I had only just set it up, I cannot say, but as soon as I opened the Bluetooth Preferences panel, the AirPods appeared. I think there is considerable potential here, not just for entertainment devices but for home technology and health applications. Listening to music using the AirPods seemed fine initially, but I was in central Bangkok (hence the need for the "Louder" command) and these are not designed to cut out sound totally. Using the BeoPlay headphones is different. However, when I was in a quieter environment, the clarity (fingers on guitar strings) was impressive. As I was using Apple Music, Alternative Radio, I gave Siri the command "Opera". The switch was done in a couple of seconds. Clarity was also excellent here, with some quieter passages coming through nicely. Siri did have trouble with my own collection and the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. I did that manually and the music sounded spectacular. Later, watching a series on iFlix, the quieter background sounds could be heard quite clearly with full stereo effects. A Skype call to my mother was reasonable: I could hear her and she could hear me (a major accomplishment). When the AirPods were first announced, everyone was sure that they would fall out of the ear and users would soon be buying replacements. Apple does anticipate some losses, but I expect this will more likely be from mislaying one. Replacement of a single AirPod is $69 (about 2,600 baht with VAT). The AirPods feel secure and fit into my ears even better than the AirBuds I typically use. Horace Dediu, the well-known commentator on Apple statistics, wrote that they had remained in the ear while he had been running, but he dislodged one when removing a sweater (upward movement). Putting the sweater on was not a problem. On Twitter, Ben Bajarin, a sometimes strong critic of Apple, tried quite hard to dislodge them several times, writing later that he had played tennis and the AirPods stayed in. He added that this is "likely not recommend by Apple but still!". I tried, of course, but could not shake them loose -- they fit so snugly. And even during a motorcycle taxi through Thon Buri sois they never felt even slightly loose. As Christmas is in a few days, I wish you the best for the season. Graham K.

The entire campus will be the second largest in the Valley, next to Intel. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) This summer, the Conair Corporation, best known for manufacturing blow dryers and curling irons, will open a new distribution center near University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale. The massive building will be longer than the Empire State Building is tall. Conair already operates two buildings at the Glendale Airpark  that occupy about 1.25 million square feet. The new facility adds about 1 million additional square feet and will make the corporate campus the second largest in the Valley, behind Intel in Chandler. The facility will create about 300 jobs by 2020 and serve as a distribution hub for the company's hair dryers, brushes, Scünci hair accessories and some kitchen appliances. "This is a very fortunate time for the entire West Valley and especially Glendale, the economic engine for the West Valley," said Brian Friedman, Glendale's Economic Development Director. Part of a vision The construction team on Monday started placing panels that will form the 45-foot-tall walls of the warehouse. By 9 a.m. Tuesday, about 15 of the 178 panels were placed, and the facility's eastern wall was taking shape. By the new year, workers will complete all four walls of the building. "It's kind of like having an instant building," said Butler Design Group architect Korey Wilkes of the tilt-up construction method. Workers use a crane to raise one side of the 200,000 pound panels, and then slide the other side along the concrete floor and into place. Steel pipes that can brace for winds up to 75 mph support the panels during construction. Steve Alley, Conair's director of western operations, said creating an expansive corporate campus in Glendale has been a part of Conair's vision since it first purchased more than 100 acres at the Airpark in 1992. This will be the New Jersey-based company's third expansion in Glendale. "Once we got our foothold in Glendale, we've done nothing but expand," Alley said. Already, Conair employs about 450 people in Glendale. According to Forbes, Conair is the 204th largest private company in the U.S. and employs 3,478 nationally. Legal issues Conair announced the new distribution center in August, about nine months after the City Council unanimously voted to settle a years-long lawsuit with the company. The city condemned 38.5 acres of Conair-owned land in the '90s to create an accident-protection zone near one of the Glendale Airport runways that was extended. But the city and company did not agree on a price for the land until late last year. Glendale is paying Conair $13.25 million for the property. As part of the settlement, the city will also waive up to $676,258 in development fees for the distribution center. City Attorney Michael Bailey said this provision of the settlement aimed to repair the relationship with Conair and encourage the company to reinvest in Glendale. "Instead of spending money for lawsuits and attorneys, we got it settled and they immediately went into expansion," City Manager Kevin Phelps said. Phelps began his role in February, after the settlement agreement. Alley said he was glad to put the legal issues behind him, but said "throughout that process we were committed to growing in Glendale." Leaders: Expansion a plus Councilwoman Joyce Clark, who represents the district where Conair is located, said the new warehouse will benefit her constituents and all Glendale residents because of the anticipated sales-tax revenue and the positive perception of the development. "It signals that Glendale is back in business and ready to build partnerships with new and old partners," Clark said. Councilman Bart Turner agreed, noting the additional revenue will help the city fund important projects. "This is where we get the money to pave the streets and approve the parks," Turner said. 1225 CONNECTTWEET 22 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2i7LvMa TOP VIDEOS Raw: Police Body Cam Video Of Dramatic Rescue 1:12 4 of the biggest Christmas myths debunked 0:57 Putin praises Trump, thinks Democrats are sore losers 0:46 Best mugshots of 2016 1:09 #Pizzagate: an example of fake news gone too far 0:57 Uber Is Investing in artificial intelligence 0:38 Five best U.S. airports 0:34 Walk the runway of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 0:48 Top five college football games to watch in Week 14 2:19 Castro's ashes travel across Cuba 0:49 Brazilian soccer team laughed boarding doomed flight 0:36 Zoo's gorilla barrier didn't meet standards when Harambe died 0:47 People formed a human ladder to rescue an man from a river in China 0:36 Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress sell for $4.8 million 1:05 Twitter expected to field offers to buy social media network this week 1:32 Black police group unhappy with political endorsements 0:32 Emu loose on I-10 in Arizona 0:12 First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades 1:23 Halloween 2016 By The Numbers 0:50 Octopus hunts one of the world's most venomous fish 0:35 Kent Somers, Bob McManaman discuss news from Cardinals camp on Friday 2:12 You Can Sleep In Dracula's Coffin Thanks To Airbnb 1:09 Five things that matter to Millennials in the election 1:52 Half-zebra, half-donkey is 100% adorable 0:27 Punchlines: Disenchanted yet? 4:54 Mexico City cartoon exhibit depicts Donald Trump as a Nazi 2:04 Former Jets player killed in crash 0:37 Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech as incredibly effective 1:15 4 dead when truck plunged off San Diego bridge into crowd below 0:43 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway 1:56 Several women say Trump inappropriately touched them 0:50

It also features Intel Gen9 integrated HD graphics, so while it won’t let you play the latest games, it should be good enough for titles that have moderate system requirements. In addition to this, Chuwi is also offering 4GB DDR3 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, so additional storage might almost certainly be needed. On the other hand, the device features two USB ports, so you shouldn’t have any problems in attaching an external hard drive. The laptop has an 8mm screen bezel and tips the scales at 1316 grams, which makes it one of the lightest notebooks in the 14.1-inch category currently on the market. It features a 9,000 mAh li-polymer battery, but its performance figures are still unknown. It goes without saying that it runs the full version of Windows 10. At first glance, the Chuwi LapBook 14.1 notebook is quite a compelling choice for those who want an affordable device with better specs, but it takes more than a spec sheet to convince a potential buyer. We’ll soon review the device and let you know if it’s worth the money or not.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Chuwi#laptop#ultrabook#Windows 10 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Chuwi LapBook laptop (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Laughs at Apple, Says Its New MacBook Is “Disappointing" Microsoft’s Latest Video Highlights What Apple’s MacBook Can’t Do Microsoft “Absolutely” Had to Be in Hardware, Former CEO Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft to Start Trial Production of Surface Phone with Pegatron - Report New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" 6 photos    Chuwi LapBook laptop New Apps Babylon: Get one-click translation in any desktop application and term search results within an extensive collection of dictionaries and glossaries Chameleon Startup Manager Lite: Software utility which enables you to edit and manage the processes running on your computer, with support for multiple languages Chameleon Startup Manager Pro: A startup management tool that enables you to quickly remove unneeded startup items and monitors the system for new apps set to launch with Windows Portable CDBurnerXP: CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning software solution that can be launched directly from a removable drive, without requiring prior installation Collectorz.com Movie Collector: A fully-featured application that helps users create a movie database, group movies into folders, perform searches, and catalogue DVDs by their barcode ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application GPU-Z Portable: A reliable and useful software solution that comes in handy to all those who want to keep an eye on the data regarding their video and graphics cards Reader comments Windows 10 Build 14997 Leaked and Available for Download more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The small refresh was said to be the addition of 4G LTE connectivity with a launch date of 23 December, which is tomorrow. However a new report is now suggesting that the upcoming laptop will not just be a tiny refresh, but will be a new addition to the existing lineup. If the latest leak is true, then Xiaomi might launch the Mi Notebook Pro. The ‘Pro’ moniker means that it will be the most high-end offering from the company. Currently, the Mi Notebook Air offers an Intel i5 6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, an Nvidia 940MX graphics card and 256GB of storage with a 13.3 inch Full HD screen. The high-end specifications of the Pro could include a 4K display, Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics card, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Now that’s a notebook we’d want! Of course, it will come at a higher cost as well, with rumours suggesting a CNY 6,000, (around Rs 60,000) which is a lot more than the introductory pricing of the Mi Notebook Air, which starts at $520 (around Rs 35,000). It is still cheaper than most notebooks out there with a similar configuration, though. Be sure to tune back in tomorrow for more information on the device.

Edsall DEC. 22, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Keith Ellison speaking at a rallying of striking federal contract workers in December. Credit Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Leaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters. Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats “have to stand for a strong, populist economic message.” He warns that “the way the working class is always controlled is that it’s divided.” A key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes that Democrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country. For a certain stripe of liberal Democrat, free trade agreements have become emblematic of what Sanders describes as a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders’s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In their Nov. 29 essay, “Another Clinton-Trump divide: High-output America vs low-output America,” Muro and Liu determined that: The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015. In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection. Muro enlarged on his findings in an email: America’s most important, competitive, and often export-intensive industries — what we call its “advanced” industries — cluster tightly in such metro counties. Some 70 percent of these crown-jewel industries are concentrated in the 100-largest metros — the core of what Hillary won. In a separate February 2015 study, “America’s Advanced Industries,” Muro and four colleagues report that the 50 industries in this heavily high-tech sector are crucial to America’s future growth: These industries encompass the nation’s “tech” sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country’s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth. The importance of these industries does not stop there: At the same time, the sector employs 80 percent of the nation’s engineers; performs 90 percent of private-sector R & D; generates approximately 85 percent of all U.S. patents; and accounts for 60 percent of U.S. exports. Advanced industries also support unusually extensive supply chains and other forms of ancillary economic activity. On a per worker basis, advanced industries purchase $236,000 in goods and services from other businesses annually, compared with $67,000 in purchasing by other industries. When Ellison announced his opposition to the trans-Pacific Partnership on Feb. 15, 2015, he was not speaking to communities that benefit from technology-intensive industries. Ellison declared: The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It’s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people — those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they’re going to make ends meet. Ellison’s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial. Take two examples. In Santa Clara County, California, voters chose Clinton over Trump 73-21. Advanced industry companies with headquarters or major facilities there include Adobe, Apple, Cisco, HP Inc. and Intel Corp. On the East Coast, in Cambridge, Mass., where Clinton won 87.8 percent of the vote to Trump’s 6.4 percent, major corporate employers include Google, Microsoft, and Biogen. According to the Muro study, “advanced industries produce $2.7 trillion in value added annually — 17 percent of all U.S. gross domestic product. That is more than any other sector, including health care, finance, or real estate,” and, directly and indirectly, “the sector supports almost 39 million jobs — nearly one-fourth of all U.S. employment.” In other words, as Muro made clear in his email: The basic fact is that a huge portion of the nation’s globally competitive economic activity occurs in those blue places. Dominated by highly productive, export-oriented advanced industries, high-tech enterprises, and professional services including the management of companies, this Democratic base is already biased toward globalism — with trade something of a core tenet. Moreover, these places are winning at trade. Muro has produced a map that shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties. Not only is expanded trade in the economic interest of economically powerful metropolitan areas that vote Democratic, but Democratic voters themselves are becoming increasingly pro-trade. Here’s the trend data from 2009 to late October 2016, collected by Pew. Trading Places Percent who liked or disliked trade agreements involving the United States.

The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders. Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24. Even though Hillary Clinton pointedly withdrew her support for the trans-Pacific Partnership in October 2015, 55 percent of her voters, according to Pew, described the TPP as a “good thing” compared to 24 percent who said it was a “bad thing.” In contrast, Pew reported that 58 percent of Trump loyalists said the TPP was a bad thing, and 17 percent looked on it favorably. Advertisement Continue reading the main story If anything, Trump’s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade. This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas — in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks. Before the 2016 campaign began, Republican voters were far more critical of both Putin and WikiLeaks than Democrats, in part because of the stronger tradition on the right of anti-communism and hostility to government leaks.

'14 July ’16 Dec. ’16 Jan. '14 Dec. '14 July ’16 Dec. ’16 Source: YouGov DEC. 22, 2016 By The New York Times Among Republicans, over the course of Trump’s candidacy, assessments of Putin steadily improved. In December 2014, two years ago, 80 percent of Republican voters viewed Putin unfavorably and 8 percent were favorable. By December 2016, Putin’s unfavorable ratings among Republicans had fallen to 47 percent and his favorable ratings had risen to 37 percent. This is the period during which Putin was accused of allowing Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails, the public release of which proved damaging to the Clinton campaign. Among Democrats during this same period, Putin’s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62. An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails. In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month. Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email, the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains. In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact — shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped. Although Trump’s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters. Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party’s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective. An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, “Recent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,” shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off. The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call “skill downsizing.” Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained. What would a progressive approach to globalization look like? A call for a radical reform of the trade negotiation process to curb the leverage of corporate and special interests is one Democratic alternative. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This leverage has been institutionalized through the creation of Industry Trade Advisory Committees that grant special access to trade negotiations to corporations ranging from pharmaceuticals to aerospace, energy to investment banks, steel to textiles. Two critics of current trade policy, Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Biden, and Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, wrote a September 2016 essay for the American Prospect, “The New Rules of the Road: A Progressive Approach to Globalization” in which they acknowledge some basic facts: Despite Trump’s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes — imports plus exports — have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent. Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreements are not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they’re about setting expansive “rules of the road” that determine who wins and who loses. The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process: With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the ‘winners’ under these rules. Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party’s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies — including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing. Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status. The nation’s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks — and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation’s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.

(AMD) Stock Is STILL a Red-Hot Buy AMD stock is worth buying on any decent dip Dec 21, 2016, 10:28 am EST  |  By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer     View All   Calling 2016 a “good year” for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders would be a considerable understatement. AMD stock is up 305% year-to-date, decisively ending a three-year dry spell. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Too much, too fast? Many would say so, pointing out that sales have been deteriorating since 2011 and the company has booked net losses in each of its past four years. Although the top line perked up a bit in the third quarter, the computer component maker is still regularly in the red. AMD is going to have to pull off some sort of mini-miracle if it’s going to justify the stock’s current price anytime soon. Thing is, it may well have a miracle or two up its sleeve for 2017. Advanced Micro Devices to Rise With Ryzen? It’s a rarity for a technology company’s fortune to be altered by the introduction of a new product. But, this is one of those times. The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016 When Advanced Micro Devices unveiled its new “Zen” microprocessor technology in August, the market was hopeful, but cautious. AMD hasn’t been especially competitive in any market for a while, ceding to rivals like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), and though the specs for Zen looked good, doubts lingered that it would be able to do what it was supposed to do when the architecture was put to its pre-launch test. Those worries, though, may not have been necessary. Zen is shaping up to be everything it was touted to be in front of its commercial debut in the first quarter of 2017. It may be the biggest and most successful launch Advanced Micro Devices has seen in a long, long while. Indeed, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to say Zen may end up saving the company. The processor truly is an engineering marvel. Renamed Ryzen in the meantime, the first entry in the Summit Ridge line of desktop processors are a true 8-core, 16-thread CPU that operates at a minimum of 3.4 GHz. That’s a bit stronger than the most comparable processor from Intel: the Core i7-6900K, which operates at a base frequency of 3.2 GHz. The i7 can be boosted up to 4.0 GHz, and it’s not clear exactly how far the Ryzen can be pushed. It’s likely to be in that 4.0 gigahertz ballpark though, and it’s going to require less power to get there. Ryzen has another dimension owners of AMD stock can get excited about — it’s got its own artificial intelligence technology built in that allows it to operate better. The Neural Net Prediction algorithm remembers which pathway a particular app runs best on, while Smart Prefetch tracks software behavior so it can best prepare the computer to run the program. It will likely be price competitive too. Although no official word had been given, initial estimates peg the processor’s price at between $500 and $600, versus the i7-6900K’s (current) sticker price of just over $1,000. And analysts have taken notice. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently upped the firm’s target on AMD stock to $13, up 22% from its current value of $10.66, explaining: “We’ve argued that AMD’s IP is undervalued and that it is in the midst of a turnaround, and AMD’s demos this week of its new Zen MPU in high-end performance applications reinforce the latter part of this thesis. Our checks continue to indicate AMD’s Zen MPU is being well received in the enthusiast DT channel, and the Asia Cloud Server market.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/12/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-still-red-hot-buy/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 Comments are currently unavailable.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Google Android Nest Software 'Twas Brillo but then Android Things, which watched as Google Weaved its Nest The Internet of Google Things 22 Dec 2016 at 13:03, Wireless Watch Comment Google has launched the developer preview of Android Things, updating and rebranding the Brillo IoT operating system which was unveiled over a year ago. Designed for medium-complexity devices, like home hubs, thermostats, and security cameras, the stripped-down version of Android has had zero success in the market. The new push, under a new name, aims to change that, and push the OS as the answer for developers of consumer-oriented IoT devices. A key component will be the ability to push images and over-the-air updates to Android Things devices, a key security requirement for the IoT, and one that appears to be a core feature of the updated OS. With Google able to push all mandatory updates to IoT devices, this would be a promising step forward for consumer IoT equipment – which has been plagued by headlines recently. It’s also in stark contrast to Android updates for smartphones, which suffer from a complete mess of different vendor and carrier barriers to the transmission of security fixes. Along with its Weave framework, Google is again using Android to position itself at the heart of the devices, by providing the cloud infrastructure and applications that add value to the devices and so generate traffic which can be monetized. The developer preview of Android Things supports Intel’s Edison, NXP’s Pico and the Raspberry Pi 3 on the hardware side. Qualcomm has announced that it expects the OS to be deployed on its Snapdragon platform in 2017, and while it was quick to issue a statement of support, it appears that Android Things isn’t running on Snapdragon SoCs currently – though of course, Qualcomm will soon own NXP and its Pico line. Android Things will allow developers to tie their devices into Google’s services, using the normal Android Studio SDK – an apparent improvement on Brillo, which had a different development environment. The challenges of a unified IoT platform Brillo was launched as a lightweight Android-based operating system for devices, aimed at speeding up development time given the industry’s collective experience with Android. However, it appears that there has been almost no traction in the market for the OS, and its developer mailing lists are very quiet – not a good sign for a project that was positioned as the future for smart home devices. But not even Google seemed inclined to use the OS. Its smart thermostat subsidiary Nest didn’t use it in its own devices, and Google’s new Home and WiFi products passed on the OS too – opting for Chromecast System Software, which is based on both Android and Chrome OS. It remains to be seen how far Google unifies its software platforms for its various hub and medium-scale IoT devices, though the common Android roots should help create a somewhat more harmonized developer base in future. And there was some indication that the search giant wants to get its IoT house in order, and preempt some of the Android fragmentation problems which have plagued the smartphone version. Also announced was the overhaul of Nest – the underwhelming subsidiary that decided to publish its own version of Weave (Nest Weave) in order to link its thermostats and cameras to other ecosystems. Nest’s software development team is now being merged into Google, a step towards commonality, but also a sign of how far the iconic smart home business has fallen. Meanwhile Weave, launched at the same time as Brillo, is a communications framework that dictates how compatible connected devices speak to each other via Google’s cloud (mostly), and also to the outside world. It takes a different approach to the other prominent connectivity and discovery frameworks, the OCF’s IoTivity and AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn, now merged. That combined platform is more focused on the device discovery and communication aspects of IoT devices, so that a node is able to discover other nodes on a local network. Weave is aimed more at the upper layers of the stack, in the applications themselves, and therefore the cloud-focused interactions. However, in the IoT, the cloud is getting closer and closer to the network edge, so one day these cloud interactions might end up taking place in the local networks (especially if local networks expand in physical footprint). Weave is also getting a public device SDK, and its current schema support for a small group of devices (outlets, light bulbs and switches, thermostats) is being expanded to add new devices “soon” - and will include an iOS mobile API (application programming interface). Currently, Google says Philips Hue and Samsung’s SmartThings are using Weave to connect to its Google Assistant service, with Belkin’s WeMo, LiFX, Honeywell, Wink, TP-Link, First Alert, and more” also pursuing Weave adoption. Notably, there was no mention of Fuchsia, a super-lightweight OS for micro-IoT devices that is not based on the Linux kernel which powers Android. Unveiled in August, there hasn’t been much news of development progress since, but Fuchsia is pretty expandable – meaning that it could potentially be the foundation of a non-Linux version of Android, for more complex devices, in future. That would fit in with the nascent trend to move away from Linux as the default basis of IoT operating systems, and learn more lessons from the really stripped-back real time OSs. However, if Fuchsia did move to the same type of devices on which Android and Chrome OS reside, there would be further confusion and potential fragmentation in the Google ecosystem. For now, though, the Android Things brand and supporting updates suggest a real effort to present a functional and unified platform during 2017.

Image: Clare Keogh Cork’s tech scene punches above its weight, but has always lacked a focal point. Teamwork co-founder Daniel Mackey says the company’s new incubator space will help fix this anomaly. The Teamwork story is one that should inspire future generations of school and college-leavers, especially in Cork, a city whose history over the last 30 to 40 years has been synonymous with that of the global tech industry. Unlike Dublin, which has its Digital Hub and Silicon Docks districts, the city has lacked a real focal point. Instead, Cork’s silicon chutzpah is seen in its people and in particular, in the global exploits of Cork entrepreneurs like Pat Phelan of Trustev and Liam Casey of PCH; or high-flying executives like Intel’s Ann Kelleher and Margaret Burgraff, and Apple’s Cathy Kearney, to name a few. And don’t forget CoderDojo was founded five years ago by James Whelton and Bill Liao at the National Software Centre in Cork. ‘We always wanted to be a product company; we never wanted to do consultancy. We just wanted to make stuff’ – DANIEL MACKEY But a new narrative in Cork’s digital story has been brewing for nine years now. Teamwork – notorious for buying the Teamwork.com domain for €500,000 two years ago – is one of Ireland’s fastest-growing tech companies and a global brand in productivity software. There are over 268,000 companies using Teamwork products across the globe, with almost 2.8m users. Customers include PayPal, eBay, Disney, Forbes and Spotify. The Teamwork story Teamwork founders Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey. Image: Clare Keogh Founded in 2007 by Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey, the company is entirely self-funded and hasn’t taken on a cent of venture capital. Since its founding, it has increased turnover year-on-year and in 2015, Teamwork is understood to have recorded €8.8m in revenues and projects worth €12.4m for this year. It is eyeing a €20m revenue target by 2020. The company invested €2m of its own funds in a new state-of-the-art building – with the unique position of giving every programmer their own office – and plans to turn its old offices into an incubator space for Cork software start-ups. ‘It has never been easier to start a software company. All you need is AWS, a laptop and a clear vision of what you want to build’ – DANIEL MACKEY The move, Mackey hopes, will provide a place where start-ups can get space to work, but also where a community will develop and entrepreneurs and techies can coalesce and help to sort out technical and business problems. “Through the years in Cork, we couldn’t just go out and meet people in our industry and just talk shop, no one we could bounce ideas off – there just wasn’t that kind of a community,” said Mackey. “Hopefully, with this new incubator we are launching, it will be the kind of place where software start-ups can meet, have coffee and talk through tech problems like caching or whatever. We also got a bit disillusioned with the meetup scene in Cork, where the same people attracted by the idea of start-up culture [rather] than the reality would turn up every time. We want to build a place where people can hang out, foster ideas and build something.” For Mackey and Coppinger, it was always about building stuff. They met in college in 1998 at Cork Institute of Technology. “He was one of the only other people in our class who was genuinely interested in coding. Everyone else joined the tech courses because they were told it was a good idea to. We had been running separate web development businesses to make money during college and kept finding we were competing. It was the kind of work where you would get three hundred quid for doing a website for a bar or restaurant. It was only one day when we spoke in the lab for the first time that we realised we had a lot in common and hit it off. “We both had a passion for game programming but quickly realised it would have been impossible. “We always wanted to be a product company; we never wanted to do consultancy. We just wanted to make stuff.” To make ends meet after college, Mackey and Coppinger set up their own consultancy business. “We found that we became busy fools. A lot of consultancy businesses fall into that trap, running around pleasing everybody.” It was when trying to implement a productivity platform to keep themselves organised that the idea for Teamwork was born. As the story goes, they reached out to the software vendor with suggestions to improve the platform but were dismissed with a lofty attitude. “We said ‘Screw those guys, we are going to do this ourselves’. And we did,” Coppinger recalled in a recent interview. Now the company has grown to 73 people and recently announced plans to create 50 new jobs. The only investment in Teamwork has been time In a first for a tech company in Ireland, developers at Teamwork are to get their own offices so they can work without interruption. Image: Clare Keogh “When we started, we had no idea how things would go. The first month, we made €186 and the following month, we doubled it. This became €30,000 a month, then €40,000 and we just kept growing to the point where we are bringing in revenues in the region of €1m a month. “When we started, we were young and naïve and we had no idea what went into building a product. There were no cloud services like AWS around at the time, we didn’t think of all the language support that would be required and dealing with all the time zones. “But that is more than made up for, by the fact that we don’t have people telling us what to do; we can build the best product we want to build. The only investment we made in Teamwork was our time.” Mackey and Coppinger share the view that anyone with the skills can establish a software company and the barriers to entry are much lower, thanks to cloud services. “It has never been easier to start a software company. All you need is AWS, a laptop and a clear vision of what you want to build. That’s why we are using our old offices as an incubator because we want to give people like us a place where they can work away from home and use their money to pay for hosting or get a new laptop, and we’ll look after the light, heat and the rest. “Hopefully, this new incubator will help drive a new chapter in Cork’s tech story.” Returning to the €2m building where developers will get their own office, Mackey believes it is time to call a halt on cubicle or open-plan culture for coders and programmers. “Being developers ourselves, we understand the importance of concentration and being in the zone and being able to concentrate for 10 hours without interruption. It’s amazing what you can accomplish in that time. Other roles in the company like HR and testing are more collaborative and that suits open plan, but we always believed developers need their own private space to get in the zone.” Mackey credits software authority Joel Spolsky of the Joel on Software blog as sparking the idea. “We make software, we are not plumbers. What programmers do is a lonely, personal thing and they need to concentrate.” A pet peeve of Mackey’s is Teamwork being labelled as a start-up. “We are nine years in business, yet we still get labelled as a start-up. Fair enough, the tech industry is a glamorous business right now, but I’ll never understand why people go to tech conferences to hear someone who has been in business for a year or two discount sage advice. I mean, a plumber in business 15 years will never be asked to speak about their business in a fireside chat, would they? “We are nine years in business and we still don’t have all the answers.” Mackey said that the Cork entrepreneurial scene has so much potential yet no one hears about it. “There are lots of young companies you never hear about but they are plugging away and building steadily. “We are lucky in [that] what we created only required the skills to do it, and we never had to take on investment because we had the consultancy to bootstrap us. It began as just one day a week and the weekends while we looked after clients the rest of the time and eventually Teamwork became more and more the full-time job. “If an investor offered us €10m in the morning, we wouldn’t know what to do with it.” As previously mentioned, Teamwork, or TeamworkPM as it was originally known, famously spent €500,000 on the Teamwork.com domain. “That was every single penny that we had in the bank at the time but we knew it was the right thing to do. People thought we were lunatics but our attitude was that if it didn’t work out, we’d just try again because we have loads of ideas and will just build something else.” Next on the horizon for Teamwork will be a new set of complementary products to the company’s existing line-up of chat, support desk and workflow platforms. “Our guiding principle is that there are products we could use, but we know we would do a better job of building them ourselves, so let’s do that. “Our golden rule is this: only work on things that make you excited.” Related: entrepreneurs, funding and investment, coding, software, The Interview, Cork Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Start-ups 500 Startups’ Elizabeth Yin: ‘Selling is the key to success at SaaS’ 16 Sep 2016303 Shares Hiring Now Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team One of Europe’s best IT workplaces Informing, entertaining and connecting the world Start-ups Is it time to fix Ireland’s venture funding imbalance? 12 Sep 201688 Shares Start-ups Phorest’s Ronan Perceval: ‘Start-ups should be under less pressure to sell’ 16 Nov 2016414 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

There's a growing number of MacBook Pro power users out there looking at the 2016 Touch Bar models and not liking what they see. The next question that comes to mind is, "what's a good alternative?" Dell's XPS laptop range features high on that list, and a leak suggests Dell is set to cater to those power users looking for a MacBook Pro alternative. Dell's existing range of XPS 15 laptops include a 4K display option, 6th generation Intel Skylake processors, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M GPU with 2GB of dedicated memory if desired. They are very capable machines. However, as Windows Central reports, the Dell website accidentally listed a new model referred to as the XPS 15 9650. The 9650 listing, for the brief time it was allowed to stay up, included options for three different 7th generation quad core Intel Kaby Lake processors carrying the model numbers Core i3-7100HQ, Core i5-7300HQ, and Core i7-7700HQ respectively. Related Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Rose Gold Edition) Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Rose Gold Edition) They will certainly offer a performance boost, but the news gets even better for power users. Dell is also replacing the GTX 960M 2GB GPU with a new GTX 1050 GPU complete with 4GB of dedicated memory. Combined with up to 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, you've got a mobile powerhouse to make any MacBook Pro owner jealous. The final additional new feature is the option of a fingerprint reader (and Windows Hello support) for added security. And if you're spending the cash to get the quad-core Kaby Lake chip and a GTX 1050 GPU, you'll likely want as much protection as possible built-in. With the listing being pulled it's unclear when Dell will launch the 9650 and how much it costs. However, the fact this listing exists and was added to the site suggests Dell won't keep us waiting much longer.

Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. Mark Religioso, a brand manager for the video game publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment, wants more women to be involved in the professional gaming arena known as esports, where players compete in video game tournaments to win thousands of dollars in prize money. So this year, Mr. Religioso began planning “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments, where esports teams consist of one man and one woman. He also began laying the groundwork for a mentoring program to foster interest in esports among women. “These are baby steps so that we can get more women on the team,” he said. “We need to make the scene a welcoming place.” Mr. Religioso’s efforts are one of several recent moves by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports, which is rapidly becoming one of the video game industry’s most visible segments. As more women play video games, the esports industry is starting to focus on getting more of them involved in professional competition to help the effort expand and become mainstream. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Revenue from esports is expected to surpass $1 billion worldwide by 2018, yet the viewership for esports is only 15 percent female, according to the market research firm SuperData. There is little data on the number of women who actually play esports, but anecdotal evidence suggests the figure may be small. Photo Diane Tran at her computer, training for video game competition. Credit Jake Michaels for the New York Times. Efforts to increase diversity in esports go back more than a decade but have started gathering momentum. In 2003, the French esports company Oxent began organizing annual women-only tournaments; 40 teams competed in the 2016 tournament in Paris, an increase of 25 percent over the previous year. Twitch, the Amazon-owned site that livestreams video game play, began hosting Misscliks, a support community for women in gaming, three years ago after some of its founders became dismayed by the lack of women in esports. Twitch also established Inclusivity City, an area for diversity organizations, at its annual convention, TwitchCon, which ran Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 in San Diego. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And this year, apart from Bandai Namco’s efforts, Intel and the esports company ESL partnered to form AnyKey, an advocacy organization that seeks to create support networks and provide opportunities for women in esports. Many women gamers welcome these efforts. With a predominance of professional male players, the culture of the video game industry has long been perceived as misogynistic. Women in esports have frequently faced heckling from teammates and anonymous threats of rape and murder. “It’s an extremely toxic environment for women,” said Stephanie Harvey, 30, who is a top competitor in esports tournaments for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. “To be a woman in esports, you have to have a thick skin.” How effective these efforts will be in drawing more women to esports is uncertain. Although Oxent, which has run the Electronic Sports World Convention for 13 years, has organized women-only tournaments for years for Counter-Strike, there is little evidence that they are encouraging more women to play competitively. Some gamers think the events reinforce the idea that women are not capable of competing with men. Lâm Hua, the head of content at Oxent, said the women-only tournaments were not entirely successful in drawing more women to esports, but after much debate, the company decided that they were “the first step in the grand scheme of women recognition in the sport.” For now, he said, they were “a necessary evil.” Other diversity efforts in esports have focused on normalizing the idea of women in gaming. Anna Prosser Robinson, a programming manager and onscreen personality at Twitch, helped push the company’s diversity initiatives after seeing women rise up, then drop out of esports. “We would see these awesome, compelling women be excited” about esports, she said. “Six months later, they would be gone.” The goal of Misscliks, she said, was to provide support and resources to encourage those women to create a network on Twitch and stay in esports. Ms. Prosser Robinson also helped bring diversity to TwitchCon this year with Inclusivity City, a physical space on the convention floor that hosted several diversity organizations like AnyKey and Hack Harassment, as well as a Smash Sisters tournament for women who play Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. fighting games. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Inclusivity is a core value of our brand,” Chase, a Twitch spokesman who goes by one name, said of the diversity effort at the convention. “It was a success this year and definitely something we could consider for next year.” AnyKey, the creation of Intel and ESL to increase the number of women in esports, focuses on two areas. One is research and discussion of the diversity issue, headed by T. L. Taylor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other is initiatives and solutions, led by Morgan Romine, a former esports player. Photo Coach Erik Stromberg observing his team in a training session. Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. AnyKey organized a women-only esports tournament in March at one of the industry’s largest events, the Intel Extreme Masters competition in Katowice, Poland. Ms. Romine said she saw women-only tournaments as a way to strengthen players’ skills and move them into open competition. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done, giving more women confidence and experience in that space,” she said. Mr. Religioso of Bandai Namco said he began noticing the lack of female esports players at regional esports tournaments last spring, like Final Round in Atlanta and Combo Breaker in Chicago. With the growth in esports, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate interest in the company’s Tekken franchise. Next year, Bandai Namco will release Tekken 7, a one-on-one fighting game that the company hopes will be popular among esports competitors. Women make up about 23 percent of the fan base for the Tekken fighting games, Mr. Religioso said, but few are playing them competitively. Rather than segregate men and women, Mr. Religioso wants them to work together in the “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments. He also wants to introduce Western audiences to the Tekken Girl’s Club, a mentorship program in Japan in which professional players teach women to master the game’s mechanics. Another solution to encourage more women into esports would be to change the way video games are made and marketed. Stephanie Llamas, director of research and insight at SuperData, said women should be participating more on the business side of the industry and developing games with women in mind. “It’s difficult to understand the demographic if you are not part of that demographic,” she said. Correction: December 23, 2016 An article on Thursday about efforts by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports misidentified the city in California where the TwitchCon convention took place this year. It was in San Diego, not in San Francisco. A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Esports Sees Profit in Attracting Female Gamers.

Mozilla's Firefox browser is a massive open source project supported by its community of volunteers - many of whom also develop apps and need to know about the hardware used by their target audience. Introducing the Firefox Hardware Report in a blog post, Andre Vrignaud and Rebecca Weiss explain the motivation behind it: Suppose you’re developing a sophisticated web game or application, and you’re wondering — will it actually be able to run? What hardware should I be targeting to get the widest possible audience? Existing hardware reports (such as those from Valve and Unity) are excellent, but represent a different group of hardware users than the majority of people who use the web. The source data for the Hardware Report was collected through the in-built Firefox Telemetry system, which automatically collects browser and platform information from machines using Firefox unless users disable it. Having been aggregated and anonymised it appears as the interactive Firefox Hardware Report. The report summary is:     By clicking More details > you can discover more useful information, including the trend over the six month period covered in the report, mid-March to mid-September 2016. For example with regard to Flash, it was available on 82% of machines at the start of the period and declined steadily to 77% by its end. The Operating System Trend shows that Windows 10 (the green line) showed a notable increase in the period achieving a final share of 26%. This was reflected almost perfectly by the decrease in Windows 7, which still retained the lion's share of 45%. Add in Windows XP's 10% and Windows 8.1's 8% and earlier Win OSs, and Windows share amounts to 93%.     Additional data about OS reveals that whereas the share of 32-to-64-bit operating systems was a third, the  share of 32-bit to 64-bit browsers showed a massive 92% for the former. With regard to CPUs  Intel has 86% of the market and AMD 14%. Nearly 70% of users have dual-core machines; over 20% have dual cores;  7% of machines are single-core, which leaves 1.5% having 3 or 8+ cores. The following chart shows CPU speeds, revealing that the most common speed is between 2.3 GHz and 2.69 GHz and if you do some arithmetic you discover that over 80% have speeds of  2 GHz and above.    A similar chart for memory, shows that 4GB is the most common with 30%, 27% of machines have more than this and only 6% have less than 2GB.   Perhaps the most interesting data relates to graphics hardware. The GPU market is more fragmented than the overview suggests, with the most popular, the Intel Haswell GT2 being used by only around 10% of the sample. The next eleven most popular GPUs are also Intel products and overall Intel, color-coded blue, have 63% of the GPU market. There are five AMD (red) GPUs, each with less than 2% of the market and AMD's total share is 18% of the market. There are only two Nvidia (green) GPUs with more than 1% of the market. Throughout the report any product or characteristic with less than 1% is put into the "Other" category which for GPU model amounts to 3%, consisting primarily of AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.   When it comes to display resolution, 1366x768px and 1920x1080px stand out as the most highly used, with the latter showing an upward trend over April to September.       All this information will be of use to web developers in knowing what limitations their target audience face and deciding which hardware to cater for and which can be ignored with little consequence.       More Information Firefox Hardware Report for Web Developers Firefox Hardware Report Related Articles Mozilla Funding - Crisis Averted For Now Firefox Losing Share As Desktop Browser Firefox 42 Developer Edition To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  Angular Jumps To Version 4 16/12/2016 The team behind Angular has decided to jump from Angular 2 to Angular 4.

(IBM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons 7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50% Upside in 2017 View All Posts Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) chips and technologies, may be over 20 years old, but the company has been acting like a red-hot startup. And investors have certainly pumped things up. For the year, Nvidia stock is up a sizzling 227% and the market cap is at $58 billion. Source: via Nvidia But can the momentum continue? Or perhaps investors may want to get cautious with NVDA stock? Well, the valuation metrics are definitely at nose-bleed levels. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 40. By comparison, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 13 times earnings and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is at 13.5. Then again, when it comes to momentum plays, the valuations may not mean much so long as the growth continues. And yes, it seems like a good bet that there will not be a slowdown anytime soon. During the latest quarter, NVDA posted a 54% spike in revenues to $2 billion and earnings more than doubled to 94 cents a share. 5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017 But hey, NVDA is targeting huge market opportunities, which should provide lots of runway for the growth ramp. So let’s take a look at three: NVDA Stock Megatrend #1: Gaming & VR Gaming is one of the oldest tech businesses. As a result, growth has not necessarily been strong. After all, the market size is at about $100 billion. But going forward, there are some key drivers that will likely juice things up. Of course, NVDA’s GPU systems will be a big part of this. Games will soon get to the point where the visuals will be life-like. Oh, and then Virtual Reality (VR) will allow gamers to immerse themselves in the environment. The forecast for this market is nearly 4 million units shipped this year and 16 million by 2020. Yet NVDA is already reaping the benefits from the favorable trends. For the past year, gaming revenues spiked by 54% to $1.244 billion. No doubt, a key has been the next-gen Pascal GPU system. Something else: About 70% of existing gaming systems are on older GPUs. So there is quite a bit of opportunity for upgrades. NVDA Stock Megatrend #2: AI and the Cloud OK, so what does a GPU have to do with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cloud computing? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. Keep in mind that companies want to do much more than just manage documents and track workflows. Rather, they want to leverage cutting-edge technologies to help identify trends or provide insights. But to do this, there needs to be tremendous computing power — and this is spot-on for GPU systems. As for NVDA, it has invested heavily in building an end-to-end AI platform that allows for deep-learning. There is also the Tesla Accelerated Datacenter Platform, which has standout metrics on speed and costs. Just some of the global customers include Barclays PLC (ADR)(NYSE:BCS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB).

It's high and most here. I. I cry with one person and this week this house when. It alt line. Games. Leslie double and he has riot there Rogers. Had time. So late when it sees that the Packers scored. And I suppose Montgomery and Rodgers. When he gets points I'd. Like now I think I knew at that point this was ignored well for me you know. Palladium Belden and battery gain in the course of the week before that was really big gap of my team you needed and I edge. Granular de Mark Cooper generally doing thing I'll basically get you've got guys up. Thursday. And that humans soared to meet Kenny Britt news. Anything. It's a sort of it's bad genes the rest that we can. You know I I thought that this is a team could win but. Didn't work out so. And it's gonna start over again yes here is all is next there's always next airs this but this you know people who work for the cubs and New York. Exactly. You have to give up. I mean I'm at Yale I was excited about my bluntly on the man I was silent and I hedged its. Then adds that this is our our second record going into the final and that guy is playing had. Expert. People I'm like what. He's even do for Intel is coming act. Forty point is it from the preach it's eat wet Derek Carr and act passed. Did terrible. Well I was forty pointed to her idol and Ian liking to you. Incredible on top but the image on an easy Alley. At like 888 baseball. I mean they were they were two guys sort of entity in the years are very highly ranked and I remember going to draft that was a little bit sort of skeptical obviously it as a rookie in the house this good. And David Johnson second year and we knew adequate ability but. I was a little bit skeptical and now look we've sixteen these guys and not the past two BP's higher year. At a premium position both angry at both an electorate. And you know you have those resident senior probably cost him now hands you know position which it.

Here is becoming in the year the pre and drop us whether big money raised quarterback. They just have gone. Out report. At no connection and at. Here it's violent Brian. Brings in Tom my comments that. It's eight catches 87 yards not use but it shows that there's something right I'm already seeing or rap or between. That age and Hopkins. All Antony. And so it's like now you're certainly wait all year for someone that the team to form. And now it finally happened. That Tom savage. Reached X team. You know you play an iPod is I. You figure saliva does it. Feel more comfortable this -- all. I think that. Eight that this is the time you play and sell. Its. And then you know like we do most recent illnesses who is on the waiver wire. And slotted in these guys knew this matchup. Neither the review that's. One do you Lewis jitterbug and the patriots. It was great last. Sort of took us about storm me your home. There's Aziz Al comes back this year and sort of he's been eased in the rotation. Hasn't on the lines and then last week first entry things. One. Analysts at 95 rushing yards over under total yards looks grades has away or back. And now you know that the jets this audiences. Stupid and match up and of the papers this agreement. Getting warmed up it's not is there. May. This year and it really cat and asked me you know I think abuse that was in the masters in. A raid the office line lot more continuity to rot actual profits of one. So I think you know Lou obviously want. Someone. This week. From your team. Robbie Anderson. Right he's looked ready is reckless car and eat it all it's it's an. We are talking about this early sort of a big place taxes currently enormous boom bust right. Get fat get attached out at a past like her. You know I think. When the pictures so it's a tough close game stores and that's when you mean patty. The jets planes from planes and married him and it has so much to. Catch. Every. Cancer expert but I didn't think you know the jets from behind the throw the ball media audiences if its efforts to illegal. Acts. And the last listed in some cardinals.

The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel’s chairman called “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.” In a rare example of bipartisanship, the panel’s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 2013 revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. House Intel Committee report finds Snowden was no whistleblower Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said it “will take a long time to mitigate the damage” Snowden caused. The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn’t a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. “Most of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America’s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,” Schiff said. Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections. The Kremlin gives rave review to 'Snowden' Snowden’s supporters have pressed President Barack Obama to pardon him before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence committee’s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russia’s hacking of Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon. Lisa Monaco, Obama’s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden “should come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers — not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he’s running away from the consequences of his actions.” The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament’s upper house, who asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the Russian government. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. Edward Snowden continues campaign for presidential pardon “The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,” Wizner said. “The report wholly ignores Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.” Tags: edward snowden russia congress Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Zotac's Zbox Magnus EN1070 mini-PC reviewed Pascal produces a mini-monster by Zak Killian  11:24 AM on December 22, 2016 Remember LAN parties? In some parts of rural America, we still don't have fancy DSL or cable internet connections, and we certainly didn't back in the mid-90s. Everyone was happy to lug their full-tower ATX PCs and 50-pound CRT monitors across the county just to play a few hours of Quake II or Starcraft. That's all ancient history now for most, but we're still having LAN parties, and so are folks elsewhere. The thing is, the machines you're likely to find at a LAN party these days are less Chieftec and more like that Gigabyte P57X gaming laptop we just reviewed. Gaming laptops have come a long way in the last few years, and even more so with the ridiculously-efficient mobile graphics chips from Nvidia that have recently become available. While the complete package of a mobile gaming laptop might not perform as well as a full-blown desktop, it comes close. You can get laptops with adaptive-sync displays, SLI, and even external liquid-cooling these days, too. Life is good if you need to take a powerful machine with you. Even so, laptops still have a lot of limitations. You have to worry about saving space for the battery, and you have to make sure it doesn't get so hot it will scorch the user. You also need to account for the display's power usage, and the whole thing has to fit within a certain thickness and weight envelope. What if you wanted a PC that was small enough to carry around anywhere, yet had some really serious gaming chops? Like ultra-settings-at-four-megapixels gaming chops? Say hello to Zotac's Magnus EN1070, the successor to the Magnus EN970 we reviewed a while back. From the pictures, I really thought this tiny terror would be larger. I have some experience with Zotac's mini-PCs, and the machines I've had using AMD low-power APUs and ULV Intel chips have been pretty dang small. Given the hardware on offer and without much visual context, I was expecting this machine to be more the size of a Playstation 4 or Xbox One. But it isn't! It's flippin' tiny. It has around the same footprint as a mini-ITX motherboard, but it's barely thicker than a Wii U. It's about as thick as four stacked DVD cases. This thing is so small my best lady-friend can stick it in her handbag. The solid copper cooling hardware inside makes it a bit heavy for that to be comfortable, though. My analog postal scale puts it at right around four pounds. The actual dimensions of the machine are 8.3" x 8" x 2.4" (21 x 20.3 x 6.2 cm.) Despite the tiny size of this box, Zotac packs a desktop Skylake quad-core CPU and a GeForce GTX 1070 inside. The GTX 1070 is the same mobile graphics card in the Gigabyte P57X we tested recently, with 2048 Pascal shaders running at a base clock speed of 1442 MHz and a boost range of 1645 MHz. Meanwhile, Intel's Core i5-6400T handles more general-purpose math. Those in the know will already be aware that this is a low-power version of the base-spec, sixth-generation Core i5 series. It starts out at 2.2 GHz, and it can Turbo up to 2.8 GHz if thermals permit. The CPU gets a pair of DDR4 SO-DIMM slots for RAM, and storage can slip into an M.2 socket and a 2.5" SATA drive bay. The M.2 socket supports SATA and PCIe drives, although it didn't like the OCZ RD400 we stuck in it when we first put together the EN1070. After some correspondance, Zotac pinned the EN1070's reluctance to boot the RD400 to a hardware or firmware problem with our pre-production EN1070 that shouldn't be present in production units. In the RD400's place, the company lent us a HyperX Predator PCIe AHCI SSD, which went nicely with the pair of 8GB DDR4-2133 CL13 SO-DIMMs HyperX provided for use with the machine. I want to take a moment and say thanks to Toshiba for the RD400 SSD, as well as to HyperX for the memory we used in the machine. The RD400 is one of the fastest SSDs we've ever tested, and I sorely missed its high capacity during testing. Meanwhile, the low-latency HyperX Impact memory is on sale at Newegg right now. Without these contributions from OCZ and HyperX, this review wouldn't have happened. Let's get a closer look at this mighty mite.

The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel’s chairman called “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.” In a rare example of bipartisanship, the panel’s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 2013 revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. House Intel Committee report finds Snowden was no whistleblower Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said it “will take a long time to mitigate the damage” Snowden caused. The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn’t a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. “Most of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America’s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,” Schiff said. Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections. The Kremlin gives rave review to 'Snowden' Snowden’s supporters have pressed President Barack Obama to pardon him before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence committee’s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russia’s hacking of Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon. Lisa Monaco, Obama’s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden “should come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers — not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he’s running away from the consequences of his actions.” The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament’s upper house, who asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the Russian government. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. Edward Snowden continues campaign for presidential pardon “The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,” Wizner said. “The report wholly ignores Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.” Tags: edward snowden russia congress Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

By Rebecca Moore editors@plansponsor.com | December 22, 2016 Page 1 of 3 View Full Article Right out of the gate in 2016, a number of Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits were filed. The pace of litigation gained more momentum throughout 2016. Aside from the typical excessive fee cases and company stock litigation of the past, Charles G. Humphrey, Employee Benefits and ERISA counsel at Fiduciary Plan Governance LLC, who is based in Buffalo, New York, says, “I think if you look at Bell v. Anthem, White v. Chevron, Ellis v. Fidelity and Johnson v. Fujitsu, I see something I haven’t seen in great volume before—a probing at quality of fiduciary process.” Stephen Rosenberg, Esq., partner at The Wagner Law Group, who is based in Boston, adds, “The year 2016 saw an expanding panoply of theories for attacking investment options and other aspects of the administration of 401(k) plans, and more of the same can be expected going forward.” Humphrey notes, for example, in Bell v. Anthem, Anthem offered a Vanguard fund charging 4 bps and was called out for not using its bargaining power to get a similar 2 bps investment. In the Chevron and Fidelity cases stable value fund use as opposed to money market fund use was questioned; a case against Intel filed last year included an allegation of too many nontraditional assets in its target-date fund (TDF) offerings; and the Johnson case challenged the use of custom TDFs. Nancy Ross, partner and head of ERISA litigation practice at Mayer Brown LLP in Chicago, adds that cases filed in 2016 have also targeted fee disclosures and arrangements between plans and service providers.    Ross says her firm is seeing a lot of sponsors who make changes being targeted with lawsuits claiming it must have been wrong before. “These are not remedial measures, but plan sponsors genuinely trying to improve their plans. They are improving on a perfectly acceptable arrangement,” she states. An example of this is the recent lawsuit filed against Starwood Hotels. In it, plaintiffs note that Starwood did reduce its fees, but for five years prior to that, participants paid excessive fees. Targets of litigation have also changed. Ross notes that in 2016, not only corporate plan sponsors, but university and college retirement plan sponsors were hit with excessive fee suits. And, while not new to 2016, church plans have faced lawsuits challenging their non-ERISA status. A split in the circuits has led to cases being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court’s decision to grant certiorari with respect to the definition of church plan under ERISA and the Code could produce a significant increase in litigation against these church-affiliated organizations if the Supreme Court agrees with the three Circuit Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue and concluded that the long-standing view of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was incorrect and defined benefit plans of these church-affiliated organizations are not church plans,” says Barry Salkin, of counsel at The Wagner Law Group, who is based in Boston.

Wanted: More women CIOs (but do they want the job?) Although women account for less than 20 percent of CIOs at large enterprises, experts say new leadership opportunities are emerging as companies undertake digital transformations. Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 21 December, 2016 02:02 - - - - print email Comments Men hold the overwhelming majority of positions in IT leadership, where women fill less than 20 percent of CIO roles at top-performing companies. The lack of diversity remains a thorny issue heading into 2017 and the numbers are unlikely to improve markedly, a painful failing for corporate boards starving for diverse C-suites. But there is a silver lining, if you can call it that: Experts say some women working for increasingly digitally focused companies are choosing leadership roles outside of IT. In an effort to bolster gender diversity in the C-suite, corporate boards are asking executive recruiters to "scour the universe" for female candidates, says Gerry McNamara, global managing director of the information officers practice at Korn/Ferry International. Korn Ferry International Gerry McNamara, Korn/Ferry International. "Most managers understand that ethnically and gender-diverse talent means diversity of thought and they want to make sure that they have a team that is thinking broadly," McNamara says. However, McNamara also says the effort is challenging because the number of male CIOs candidates is significantly higher than female candidates. [ CIO.com blogs: Diverse-IT ] The spotlight on the diversity challenge have never been brighter. In recent years, statistics released by Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech companies detailing poor workplace diversity have become a sore spot. Gender diversity issues are particularly acute in the C-suite. A Korn/Ferry analysis of top 1,000 performing companies by revenue found that women currently fill only 24 percent of prominent C-Suite titles, such as CEO, CFO, CIO and CMO. The poll also revealed that only 19 percent of CIOs are female. Diversity in tech headed the wrong way Focus that lens on the Fortune 500 and the female CIO count is even smaller. Last year, 87 of the Fortune 500 had female CIOs, or 17.4 percent, according to Sharon Gillenwater, founder and editor in chief of C-suite marketing consultancy Boardroom Insiders. As of November 1, the number dropped to 75, or just 15 percent. And while 20 percent of Fortune 100 companies have women CIOs in 2016, the number is down from 24 percent in 2015, Gillenwater says. Boardroom Insiders. Sharon Gillenwater, Boardroom Insiders. [ Related: Battling gender bias in IT ] The numbers are as overwhelming as they are unsurprising. Korn/Ferry’s McNamara says gender diversity in the C-suite, particularly for technology managers, is a systemic issue he's seen since he began his executive recruiting career at Heidrick & Struggles in 1995. One of the reasons is that IT still suffers from the perception problem: Most people still view the CIO as some guy with a computer science background who manages servers. The male-dominated culture, portrayed in television shows such as the AMC series "Halt and Catch Fire," can be unappealing to women. It needn't be this way, says McNamara, who notes that the CIO role has evolved beyond the data center to become more focused on driving business transformations and customer-facing initiatives. The digital era is characterized by on-demand services and the democratization of mobile and cloud computing. Two decades ago most corporate computers were sealed in air-conditioned rooms. Today consumers walk around with smartphones in their pockets and order products and services from the likes of Amazon.com and Uber. McNamara says that while a technical background helps, many successful CIOs today are smart, high-performing leaders who can manage complex, large-budget projects and deliver them on time. "The path for CIOs used to be development, infrastructure, architecture and over time you'd become a candidate for a CIO role," McNamara says. "But you don't need to [follow] that path anymore. There are a number of CIOs who aren't technical but are great leaders." Women’s leadership choices extending beyond IT But here's another truth: There are also a number of women for whom the CIO role is simply not as attractive as other emerging functions. The proliferation of digital transformations has given rise to several prominent, high-level positions for strong female leaders. Witness GE's Beth Comstock, who after introducing lean startup principles at the industrial manufacturer while serving as CMO, was promoted to vice chair of business innovations, where she focuses on business model transformation. And some top-performing women CIOs, including GE's Jamie Miller, Deutsche Bank's Kim Hammonds and Intel's Kim Stevenson, have been promoted to other roles within their organizations. [ Related: 4 women describe their nontraditional journeys to tech ] "Maybe the CIO role is not the ultimate choice for women who can pick and choose where they go," says Gillenwater, of Boardroom Insiders. Gartner analyst Tina Nunno says more women are moving into chief digital officer or similar roles. “It’s a highly strategic, customer-facing role, and quite a few women are gravitating to that particular role,” Nunno says. Earlier this week, Rent-A-Center CIO Angela Yochem hired Wal-Mart executive Lety Nettles as vice president of digital integration, a newly created position at the furniture company. Whether women who assume leadership roles outside of IT return to become CIOs in the future remains a question. But corporate boards are keenly interested in instituting more diversity in their C-suites because of empirical evidence that diversity tends to engender greater profitability. In February, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and EY found that companies with at least 30 percent women in leadership roles may boost their net profit margins by 15 percent compared to those with no female leaders. There is no easy path to solving the gender diversity problem, though Nunno says the greater awareness Silicon Valley companies have brought to diversity can help. For instance, she says that recent controversies about unequal pay have forced Silicon Valley companies to review and compare salaries of women and men. "This could force companies to look more objectively at how people are performing and have a much broader discussion on who they're looking at as potential leaders," Nunno says.

USEUROPEAFRICAASIA 中文双语Français HOME CHINA WORLD BUSINESS LIFESTYLE CULTURE TRAVEL SPORTS OPINION REGIONAL FORUM NEWSPAPER China Daily PDF China Daily E-paper MOBILE Business Macro Companies Industries Technology Motoring China Data Finance Top 10 Home / Business / Technology Standalone VR goggles expected to boom in China By Liu Zheng | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2016-12-21 17:09 Huang Xiaojie, CEO of Baofeng Mojing, delivers a keynote speech on Dec 20, 2016, during the launch event for the company's new products in Beijing. [Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] A domestic virtual reality (VR) hardware manufacturer launched a brand new standalone head mount display (HMD), further stimulating the segment market already in full swing. On Tuesday, Baofeng Mojing, the VR arm of the Baofeng Technology Co Ltd, unveiled the "Matrix" -- VR goggles equipped with 3K resolution built-in display. The company claimed the HMD device is the lightest gadget that hit the market among the same category of products. Feng Xin, CEO of Baofeng, said at the product's launch ceremony that the device fulfills the three major pain points of the VR device for consumers, which are the demand for higher definition, lighter weight and decrease of feeling faint. The device was priced at 2,499 yuan ($360), and the company said one hundred early-adaptors will be selected and will receive the products for hands-on trial, with purchasing at a discount price of 1,999 yuan. No specific dates for the publicly shipment were announced during the event. The industry witnessed an investment shrink when fierce homogeneous competition appeared in the market this year. More companies are forced to curtail the R&D process or even went bankrupt due to suffocated fundraising. Baofeng Mojing cut down 50 of its headcount and about 100 employees, who are specialized in content building, were shifted to new established VR subsidiaries. "We're hoping to become a dominator in the market to promote the industry from winter to a vibrant spring," said Feng. "VR will become commercialized and major vendors in the market will be making profits by 2017 to 2018." He elaborated that VR will be massively exploited and implemented in industries such as tourism, education, automobile, real estate and sports in the next two years and standalone HMDs will become one of the next bestsellers. "Domestic vendors, such as Xiaomi and Huawei, as well as major domestic internet companies and global players, like Facebook, will all be eager to participate and aim to grab a piece of the market shares," Feng added. Baofeng's Matrix, a standalone HMD and its accessories are displayed on Dec 20, 2016, during the product launch event held in Beijing. [Photo by Liu Zheng/chinadaily.com.cn] The existing consumer VR devices sold on the market include three major categories - Google's Cardboard-like mobile VR, all-in-one, or known as standalone HMD, and PC or game console driven goggles, such as HTC Vive or Sony PSVR. Many Chinese vendors tend to invest in the first two categories, and similar to Baofeng Mojing, DeePoon, Pico, 3Glasses, 3Dinlfe and Lingvr have all unveiled standalone HMDs in recent years. Neo Zheng, a research manager of client system research at International Data Corporation (IDC) told chinadaily.com.cn that according to the market analysis data monitored by the company, the shipments of VR devices in China is seen continually rising, and the technology bottlenecks, such as processing performance and battery life will restrain new vendors who are keen on investing in the standalone HMD market. "But we're optimistic about the market boom in the mid- and low- end market as upstream manufacturers, such as, Intel and Qualcomm launch more powerful chips and mobile solutions," said Zheng. Julian Tan, an analyst at the industry consulting company GfK China also said that the standalone HMD market will see a certain amount of increase next year. "More time should be given to make breakthroughs in the core technologies and consumer education in the segment market," she added. Another domestic vendor DeePon has announced it will start crowd-funding on Friday for its latest all-in-one VR device on Taobao. Latest statistics from IDC show that the worldwide VR headset shipments will reach 10.1 million units, and by 2020, the volume is expected to achieve 61 million, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 100.7 percent. Tom Mainelli, IDC's program vice president of Devices & AR/VR, said, "This year we saw major VR product launches from key players such as Oculus, HTC, Sony, Samsung, and Google.

Companies using Privacy Shield worry that it may face the same fate as long-used predecessor the Safe Harbor Framework, which was overturned by the European Court of Justice in October 2015 after revelations of mass surveillance by the U.S National Security Agency.  Digital Rights Ireland and French civil liberties group La Quadrature du Net have also challenged Privacy Shield in court, saying the new framework doesn't adequately protect Europeans' privacy. While U.S. companies are embracing Privacy Shield, many European businesses are "still concerned that Privacy Shield will not hold up under court scrutiny, and they will find themselves in the same scenario as they were in October 2015, when the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down," said Deema Frei, global privacy officer at Intralinks, a New York cloud-based content collaboration provider. Some European companies see Privacy Shield certification as a "tick box" compliance exercise, she added. With some doubts about its long-term viability, companies should also consider other data transfer agreements, such as EU model clauses or binding corporate rules, she recommended. However, if companies can get certainty about Privacy Shield's future, and if it won't be "attacked in the long term by data privacy activists trying to discredit it and challenge its validity, I believe it will work in the long run," Frei added.  More than 1,100 users As of early December, about five months after Privacy Shield went into effect, about 1,150 U.S. companies had signed up to handle European customer data under Privacy Shield, up from about 500 at the end of September. Another 600 U.S. companies had applications under review. Those numbers compare to more than 4,500 U.S. companies that had participated in the Safe Harbor data-transfer program, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Like Intralinks, cloud security firm CipherCloud is worried about the legal challenges to Privacy Shield, said David Berman, senior product marketing manager there. "If a European Court decision does invalidate Privacy Shield, there will be another period of uncertainty" similar to what happened after the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down, he said. "If the new framework can withstand legal challenges it should continue to attract companies that want an overarching mechanism to transfer EU data to the U.S." Small and medium-size businesses, as well as cloud providers, seem to be embracing Privacy Shield, but the new data transfer rules impose more obligations than the old agreement, Berman said.  "Privacy Shield has more privacy protections for individuals than Safe Harbor, so firms will have to be more diligent and ensure they are complying with the new privacy principles or risk public disclosure of a violation by the U.S. Department of Commerce," he said. "Some firms may find the increased oversight, additional requirements, and sanctions for non-compliance under Privacy Shield a barrier to adoption." Compliance and surveillance With the number of Privacy Shield companies still lagging behind those that used Safe Harbor, this could indicate that Privacy Shield is more difficult to comply with, added Elodie Dowling, corporate vice president and general counsel for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at BMC Software. In addition to the legal challenges, some EU data privacy regulators have suggested that Privacy Shield "does not do enough to curtail U.S. surveillance," Dowling added. EU privacy regulators will review the agreement in 2017. The legal challenges may be only beginning, she added. Max Schrems, the Austrian man who led the fight against Safe Harbor, has questioned how 500 companies received certification in the first month Privacy Shield was available. "This is undoubtedly showing that there are serious concerns around ... Privacy Shield and its ability to indeed protect EU citizen’s fundamental right of privacy when their personal data is being transferred to the U.S.," Dowling said. BMC has not yet signed up for Privacy Shield, instead deciding to "rely on another mechanism to safely and legally transfer personal data outside of the EU anywhere in the world" -- through binding corporate rules. For Privacy Shield to succeed, it needs support from the EU, including the data protection authorities in each member state, added David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer. Intel supports the new agreement but wants to keep other mechanisms, such as binding corporate rules, in place as well, he said. If data transfers are between subsidiaries of the same company, companies can use binding corporate rules to define the data responsibilities. As an alternative to Privacy Shield, companies can protect external transfers through model contract clauses restricting what the receiving company may do with the data.  But companies are concerned about the future of those alternate data transfer methods as well, Hoffman said. While Privacy Shield and alternative transfer methods are in place for now, the future is uncertain. "Some of the same arguments about Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield can be made about alternative transfer methods," he said. "If there are concerns about law enforcement and national security agencies accessing information, then there would be the same concerns about alternative methods because those agencies can also access it when it's transferred by other means."

Twitter Facebook US cyber security mission to showcase Australian credentials Alastair MacGibbon and Craig Davies to lead Austrade cyber security delegation to the US Austrade (Computerworld) 21 December, 2016 15:29 - - - - print email Comments Australia’s world-class cyber security capabilities and researchers will be showcased to global players attending the RSA Conference in San Francisco from 13–17 February 2017. Alastair MacGibbon, Special Adviser to the Prime Minister on Cyber Security, and Craig Davies, the recently appointed CEO of the Australian Cyber Security Growth Network, will jointly lead Austrade’s delegation to the United States. The mission will provide Australian companies with briefings from key American cyber security experts, industry updates and connections to leading companies with potential business opportunities. Nicola Watkinson, Austrade’s Senior Trade and Investment Commissioner for North America, said the US is recognised as the global leader in cyber security, with four of the top five cyber security vendors headquartered in the US. ‘The industry is based around technology centres which are mapped out in our recently released Cyber Security US Clusters Report. The US federal government is the primary driver of the US cyber security industry, followed by the banking and finance, healthcare, critical infrastructure and ICT industries,’ said Watkinson. The US federal government’s initiative to improve cyber security for critical infrastructure positions it as the biggest spender and supporter of cyber security in the US, with US$19 billion (A$25.1 billion) budgeted for 2017. Outside of the government, the banking and finance sector spends the most on cyber security, which is projected to exceed US$68 billion between 2016 and 2020. In 2015, JPMorgan spent US$500 million on cyber security, while Bank of America has announced cyber security is its only division without a spending limit. ‘Recently I had the opportunity to visit the Citibank Cyber Fusion Centre,’ said Watkinson. ‘The way in which leading private-sector players are grappling with cyber threats provides some great examples of industry best practice, and a chance for Australian solution providers to see where the trends are heading and how they can capture a piece of this growing business.’ San Francisco’s Bay Area is a cyber security hotspot in the US and receives the most venture capital investment in the country. A total of US$12 billion (A$15.8 billion) was invested in the first two quarters of 2016. Read more Vodafone to launch cyber security centre Ms Watkinson said leading global cyber security firms Symantec, Intel, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and FireEye all have their headquarters in the Bay Area and have established a presence in Australia. ‘This provides Australia’s cyber security businesses with an added advantage. We are also assisted because Australia is a popular testbed for technology, as well as the home of some of the best cyber security research institutions, making us an attractive ecosystem,’ noted Watkinson. ‘Beyond The Bay, other established clusters are found in DMV (Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia), Massachusetts (Boston), the New York Tri-State Area and the San Antonio-Austin Corridor. ‘US companies across finance, defence, critical infrastructure and healthcare are rapidly gearing up to address cyber security threats. Australian companies looking to grow their business should consider working with Austrade to tap into market trends, new government initiatives and the extensive network of contacts available to capture this market opportunity,’ said Watkinson.

The mission also builds on the ongoing initiatives being implemented by Australia’s Landing Pads program, which commenced when San Francisco was established as the first of five global locations in February this year. The Landing Pads program, managed by Austrade, is part of the Australian Government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda to help Australian entrepreneurs bring their ideas to market and build high-growth, high-return enterprises. With a network of six offices in New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago and Houston, Austrade is well placed to assist Australian businesses.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 21, 2016December 21, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Atomic Magnetometers Market is Expected to Gain Popularity Across the Globe Atomic magnetometers are the devices, which are used for high sensitivity detection of magnetic fields in a large number of applications such as locating unexploded underground structures to detecting biomagnetic fields associated with heart and brain. Atomic magnetometers have shown remarkable changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems with its recent innovation in achieving maximum sensitivity for biomagnetic fields without using cryogenic cooling. This procedure has helped in developing NMR and MRI equipments with reduced size and less operating expenses. Atomic magnetometers also enable accurate prediction of studies related to drug delivery for pharmaceutical development. Currently, research activities are being conducted to develop atomic magnetometers for magnetoencephalography (MEG), in order to measure magnetic fields produced by electric impulses in the human brain. According to the type of products, the atomic magnetometer market is segmented into two categories namely: Cold atomic magnetometry Spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer Among these, SERF magnetometers are majorly used due to their high sensitivity per unit volume towards biomagnetic fields in comparison to cold atomic magnetometers. These magnetometers use lasers to detect the interaction between alkali metal atoms in vapor and in magnetic field. SERF magnetometers are also capable of detecting magnetic impurities, which enhance the quality of the results inferred by the devices as it eliminates the interferences caused during magnetic imaging. View Sample Report @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5297 The atomic magnetometers market is growing at faster pace majorly due to its capability of producing low-cost MRI for noninvasive diagnostics. Additionally, atomic magnetometers monitor chemical reactions and biological processes associated with heart and brain using magnetic particles which results in more accurate analysis of human anatomy. High sensitivity to weak magnetic fields, low initial cost, low maintenance cost and portability are some of the other factors which are also helping the atomic magnetometers market to grow rapidly. The atomic magnetometers market is also facing few restraints such as atomic magnetometers can operate only near zero magnetic field and the necessity to heat sensor vapor cell before operation. This is because high magnetic field leads to generation of electric current in human body which interferes in medical imaging procedure resulting in inappropriate results. Large number of the companies are involved in research and development and manufacturing of the atomic magnetometers. Companies based in U.S. and Europe have shown major interest in atomic magnetometers market majorly due to government support towards research and development activities and availability of suitable infrastructure. Recently, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory has developed an optical atomic magnetometer which works efficiently for MRI systems. The company received the U.S. patent for this product in 2012. This system consists of several micrometer and nanometer sized magnetic particles which add controllable dimension for large number of biological processes. This system can be used for controlled drug delivery, cell separation, hyperthermia treatment and protein labeling in addition to medical imaging.

Unlike the massive rigs of the early ‘90s that you could only find in dedicated arcades, headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR helped bring VR into consumers’ homes around the world. But these systems are all still in their infancy. And as much as tech experts, yours truly included, touted 2016 as the year of VR, things didn’t exactly pan out that way. Facebook’s (FB) Oculus, HTC and Sony (SNE) are incredibly tight-lipped as to how many VR headsets they’ve sold so far, but according to IDC Research’s Lewis Ward, the three systems will have likely sold about 800,000 units this year While those sales aren’t a exactly a bust, Ward considers them “marginally disappointing.” By comparison, Samsung, which also keeps its sales numbers a secret, says millions of people have used the Gear VR. IDC, meanwhile, estimates that 700,000 gaming households have purchased the headset. Hopes are still high for at-home VR systems, though. Back in May, Forrester Research’s J.P. Gownder estimated that there will be about 52 million virtual reality headsets in the wild by 2020 and that 32% of households with VR systems will have one high-end setup and one phone-based device. So how can the market mature in 2017? Proving it works My job provides me with the unusual opportunity to try the biggest technologies on the market before most people even get to touch them. So I can attest to the fact that the Rift, Vive and PSVR are impressive pieces of technology. Gownder, though, explains that people have been burned by VR in the past, which can make them hesitant to spend their cash on new devices. Early VR systems didn’t live up to the hype and the industry floundered as a result. Consumers were promised the ability to step into virtual worlds and experience things they never thought possible, but were instead met with ungainly polygons and ugly graphics. The fear among consumers is that headsets like the PSVR, Rift and Vive, which retail for $400 to $800, will be nothing more than passing fads. And you can’t blame them for such skepticism. One need look no further than the incredible rise and fall of 3D televisions for an example of a tech craze that came and went in a flash. View photos The HTC Vive is one of the most expensive and immersive VR headsets you can buy.More In an IDC survey of about 7,000 likely VR consumers, 23.4% said the visual quality of VR systems is still the most important factor when it comes to their purchasing decision. Oculus, HTC and Sony have tried to get in front of this type of hesitance by displaying their devices at big-box retailers and hosting nationwide tours. But gaining consumers’ trust will simply take time. Bringing down the price Let’s face it: Virtual reality systems are crazy expensive. The HTC Vive costs $800, while the Rift can cost as much as $880 with additional motion controllers and a third camera sensor for room-scale VR. Sony’s PSVR costs $400, but if you don’t have a PlayStation Camera or PlayStation Move controllers that cost grows to $500. What’s more, the Vive and Rift need powerful PCs to do the kind of graphical heavy lifting needed to bask your eyes in all of that sweet VR goodness. Sony’s PSVR requires a PlayStation 4, which is another $250. According to IDC’s Ward, cost is the No. 1 concern among potential VR consumers, a fact that’s reflected in the demographics of current owners. As it stands, 40% of Rift and 38% of Vive customers live in households that make more than $100,000 a year. But companies like Oculus are already working to bring pricing under control. When the Rift was first announced, consumers had to expect to lay out at least $1,000 for a PC capable of running the headset. Since then though, Oculus announced that it is working with PC makers to ensure its system runs on PCs priced as low as $500. That’s a significant improvement.

Both Intel and Microsoft are working with third-party OEMs to produce headsets that are more affordable and won’t need to run on PCs. Microsoft’s solution is more of a mixed reality setup similar to its HoloLens headset, but the concept of lowering costs is the same. Making compelling content The reason you’d consider buying a VR headset in the first place is the content. But so far, much of what I’ve seen and experienced in terms of virtual reality systems has felt like little more than tech demos. I’ve yet to play a game or use any other interactive application that I could see myself enjoying for longer than an hour. And that’s a big problem. If someone is going to drop $1,000 on a headset and the PC or game console to run it, they’re going to want to make sure they can use it for more than a day before tiring of it. To do that, game developers are going to have to create experiences that truly take advantage of the opportunities VR offers. Early examples of such games include “Job Simulator” and Google’s “Tilt Brush.” Both games, though short-lived, use VR to pull in gamers in a way that normal console or PC games can’t. Simply porting regular games to VR won’t work, either. I can already play “Fallout 4” on my PS4 or PC; there’s no reason for me to play it in VR too. Gamers want unique experiences for their new headsets. 2017: The year of VR? The initial thought that virtual reality would take off like a rocket in 2016 was hopeful at best and misguided at worst. Traditional video game consoles like the Xbox One and PS4 take time to reach critical mass on the consumer market, so it only makes sense that an entirely new form of interactive gaming would take just a bit longer. It’s true that 2017 will see plenty of improvements in the VR space, but it won’t be the year virtual reality becomes as ubiquitous as today’s gaming consoles. That’s still a few years off.

Written by Guest author 22 December 2016 @ 09:03 Telecoms.com periodically invites expert third parties to share their views on the industry’s most pressing issues. In this piece Shrikant Shenwai, CEO of the Wireless Broadband Alliance, takes a look at the current state of play with 5G. From smartphones and tablets, to connected cars and even smart kettles, the world we are living in is becoming increasingly connected. In fact according to Gartner, by 2020, there will be almost 21 billion connected ‘things’ in use around the world. 5G is promising to be the framework for the connected world, with things, data applications, transport systems and cities seamlessly talking to one another and sharing information to improve our quality of life. But with 5G only a few years away (and with some operators even citing 5G implementations by 2018), what will a 5G world look like? How will licensed and unlicensed technologies work together to deliver new services? How will Wi-Fi and mobile networks evolve to cope with 5G? And how will the gap in interfaces be addressed to connect different devices and across vertical industries? We’ve asked the more than 65 operators, vendors and hubs from six different continents to share exactly what it is they think will need to happen to kick-start the road to 5G, and found out from industry leaders what they think the 5G world will really look like. What is 5G? There has been much debate in the industry as to what 5G will actually look like, with almost every company having their own definition of 5G. While we know it will be the glue that connects everything to everyone, how do the companies that are helping to make 5G a reality see it? For KT, 5G is about providing massive seamless connectivity for all devices, in hyper-real time speed and with low latency. This will support countless devices hitting the network and trying to gain access at the same time, as well as support various types of traffic – from Kbps to massive 3D content and holograms going through the future network. For Cisco, “5G is far bigger than radio and transcends mobility to provide networking as a platform… Think of the enormous potential for countries, cities, venues, industries, transportation, people and all of the infinite interplay between things, people and services/applications. If we play it right 5G can live up to the hype and expectations to support and deliver new services that have not yet been invented.” While the 5G umbrella network encompasses a virtually limitless number of verticals, when will 5G really come in to fruition? Expectation vs reality While most of the industry is already looking into 5G related topics, and with many believing 5G will be standardized by 2020, only a third of the industry expects to have deployments in place by this time. Operators are even less optimistic, with two thirds expecting to have 5G deployments in place by 2025. For 5G to be successful, the industry agrees that convergence of services and technologies, virtualization and regulation of shared spectrum models are critical. For operators, virtualization is an absolute must for 5G to become a reality. Standardization is a major industry gap that needs to be addressed, along with coexistence of technologies and certification. For Orange, 5G will not only extend and open new opportunities in vertical markets – from factories to utilities, healthcare to automotive, agriculture and cities – it will offer a consistent user experience. However, like any new generation, 5G will require significant investment from operators – and with revenues decreasing, a major challenge the industry faces is having a regulatory environment that encourages investment in connectivity. Convergence and coexistence More than half of the industry believes that 5G will be a combination of licensed and unlicensed technologies, with an agreement that unlicensed, in some way, shape or form, will be relevant for 5G. We are predicting that Wi-Fi will be the unlicensed spectrum technology that is a significant driving force for 5G. For Cisco, “there has never been a better time to start building the next generation 5G ready network. The market knows it, [and] our service provider customers know it as well… 5G will be as strong as its weakest link across domains: HetNet, Cloud-RAN, IP transport, mobile core, edge and orchestration, analytics, and security”. ZTE believes that unlicensed technologies, coupled with core networks, can increase the access network capacity and benefit users’ wireless experience. Intel is very much in agreement when it comes to the convergence and coexistence of licensed and unlicensed technology – a world where everything is connected, it believes the industry needs all the spectrum it can get. The perks of unlicensed The industry believes that the services that are set to be improved by the use of unlicensed technologies as part of 5G are smart cities, IoT sensor networks, safety and surveillance, smart home and healthcare. Why unlicensed? The main benefits of unlicensed technologies focus on enhanced throughput, and better cost and coverage. Orange believes that “Network operators will need to access various spectrum resources to deliver ubiquitous services… LAA and LWA are seen as complementing licensed technologies to provide increased capacity for small cells in a variety of locations such as indoor for enterprises and public venues, and outdoor hotspots and events.” Cisco is of a similar view, and believes that 5G is about leveraging the best access technologies in a seamless manner to stay plugged in the connective tissue of internet, with ‘seamless interoperability’ as 5G’s mantra. Key 5G takeaways 5G is on the horizon, and the industry believes it will be a combination of licensed and unlicensed technologies. Convergence of services and technologies is currently the industry hot topic, with coexistence enabling the efficiency levels seen in Wi-Fi networks. With smart cities, IoT sensor networks, safety and surveillance being the industry verticals driven by 5G, more needs to be done in terms of spectrum allocation, cost and regulation, in order arrive to make a 5G a reality.

My 2016 Favorites: Vulkan, Fedora 25 Wayland, Mesa Improvements Written by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 21 December 2016 at 09:30 AM EST. 2 Comments So far this year on Phoronix I have written more than 3,400 articles on open-source and Linux. Of all the events this year, which were my favorite? Here's my favorite announcements and milestones for Linux and free software in 2016. When the year is coming to a close I'll cover the most popular news and reviews on Phoronix for 2016 while this article are just my favorite events from 2016. Vulkan - The Khronos Group rolling out the Vulkan 1.0 API is without a doubt my favorite news this year! Game developers and others in need of accelerated graphics finally have a new cross-platform solution that's much more modern and capable than OpenGL. Vulkan's reception has been great, there are Vulkan Linux driver vendors from all major vendors, and how quickly RADV was brought up by the open-source community shows the benefits for driver developers over OpenGL. There are also many exciting Vulkan projects on GitHub, bindings for many different languages, and a lot of other developer excitement about this new graphics API. In 2017 we should see Vulkan adoption go further and implemented by more games. Seeing only two major Linux games (The Talos Principle and Dota 2; DOOM on Windows, if counting that) powered by Vulkan in 2016 was sad though as was the lack of AMD publishing their open-source Vulkan driver code yet. Hopefully in 2017 we'll also see Vulkan-Next with proper multi-GPU support and more. Fedora 25 Wayland - Fedora 25 in general is rock-solid and that makes it especially exciting too with the default change-over to using Wayland by default with Fedora 25 Workstation atop GNOME 3.22. I've been running Fedora 25 Workstation as my primary desktop on my main production system and it's been phenomenal. I am super happy with how Fedora 25 turned out and related to that how the past few GNOME releases have been very reliable and polished. Mesa Improvements - Mesa3D made incredible strides in 2016. The Intel i965 (Broadwell+) and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers now support OpenGL 4.5 (NVC0 is effectively there too), RADV and ANV Vulkan drivers landed, many performance improvements landed for all major drivers, Gallium3D Nine is in much better shape now, NIR enhancements, continued work on smaller drivers like VC4 and Freedreno Gallium3D, and there's been tons of other improvements as outlined in dozes (well, probably over one hundred) Mesa articles on Phoronix this year. If I had to pick three favorite highlights for 2016, those would be my items. Share with us in the forums what were your favorite highlights of 2016 for Linux and open-source. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The departures from the 2016 MacBook Pro — MagSafe charger, USB and memory card slots, and a keyboard with more than 0.55mm of travel — are all things the iPad lacks. The improvements to the same machine — thinner, lighter, all-metal chassis, a display with wider color gamut, and a sliver of a touchscreen called the Touch Bar — are all things the iPad has. If it’s not perfectly obvious, Apple’s efforts with its new Macs are to wean its old users off their desktop and laptop habits and familiarize them with the new world of touchscreen PCs. What that means for macOS is that it’s fast turning into legacy software: an afterthought on its way to becoming abandonware. This may all sound very dramatic, but yesterday’s report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, someone with impeccable connections within Apple’s ranks, agrees with my assessment: In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. The internal rearrangement of priorities for Apple is very much evident in the changes the company has made in recent years. Final Cut Pro X was a simplification of Apple’s video-editing software that drove many pros away. The professionally inclined Aperture photo editor app has also been replaced by the more universal and simplified Photos. Siri made its way from iOS to macOS, and has been followed by Touch ID and a catalog of touch controls in the Touch Bar. The only other big user-facing alteration to macOS in recent times has been Apple’s Continuity, which is designed specifically to make Macs better at communicating and collaborating with iOS devices. Continuity is like the Mac’s W1 wireless chip for headphones: a spoke connecting the peripheral device to the iOS-based hub. Apple’s new features are "trickling up" from mobile to the desktop It might be arguable that Apple is melding its two operating systems into one, but the weight of evidence is heavily on the side of the company making iOS as good as it can be, and then dragging macOS along for the ride. Everything happening with macOS and the computers running it seems to be a retrofitting or adaptation of Apple’s leading-edge stuff on iPhones and iPads. We’ve long ago passed the point of "trickling down" desktop features to the mobile realm — Apple has been "mobile first" for much longer than competitors like Microsoft have been touting that slogan. Broader industry trends would appear to support Apple’s (unspoken) decision to treat Macs as its second-class citizens. The truth is that Intel-powered x86 computers — like the MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac — are hitting a performance and efficiency ceiling, whereas ARM chips like Apple’s A series keep going from strength to strength. Investors want to see growing sales, and to secure those, Apple needs to show consumers constant and meaningful improvements in its products. Thinking along similar lines, Microsoft recently announced it’s developing the means to make Windows applications run on ARM processors, and everyone else in the traditional PC industry is also working on blurring the line between tablet and laptop. The curious thing with Apple is how settled the strategy appears to already be. Even while the Bloomberg revelations seem to paint a rare picture of disorder within Apple, there’s no indication that the company’s vision is sundered. Scything off essential ports from the MacBook Pro, as Apple just did, is the expression of a deliberate choice from the company to move aggressively toward a less wired and more mobile future. Apple may be aggravating many of its established users today, but it sees a bigger market and greater opportunities by pursuing the path it has chosen. Macs are still a $22 billion business, but Apple is prioritizing the more lucrative iOS One of the things that can sometimes go neglected when discussing the Mac, which is after all the product line that first made Apple famous, is how small it has become on the company’s balance sheet. In 2016, Macs accounted for 10.5 percent of Apple’s net sales and were eclipsed by the company’s Services division, which includes things like the iTunes Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. The iPhone, by comparison, brought in six times as much in net sales. Macs are still a very meaningful $22 billion business, but Apple clearly has more lucrative opportunities that it has chosen to prioritize. macOS is, of course, not going to disappear anytime soon. Many people rely on it for their jobs — iOS app developers among them — and there’s a passionate user base that will extend its life far beyond the amount of time it takes Apple to transition all its eggs into the iOS basket. But make no mistake about it, that move is already underway. iOS is the center of Apple’s universe, and everything that is to come from the Cupertino company will be in service to its most profitable platform.
