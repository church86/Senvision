News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Cooler Master's MasterAir Pro 3 and MasterAir Pro 4 CPU coolers reviewed Don't mess with success by Jeff Kampman  3:56 PM on October 31, 2016 If you've bought an unlocked Intel CPU recently, chances are you've placed one of Cooler Master's Hyper 212 Evo heatsinks in your shopping cart to go with it. That classic cooler has been around in some form or another for the better part of a decade, and its great price-to-performance ratio has made it a perennial best-seller on Newegg. (I challenge you to find any other product with nearly 5000 reviews and a five-egg rating there.) MasterAir Pro 4 on the left, MasterAir Pro 3 on the right Sometimes, even the best things in life have to change. Cooler Master is in the midst of a top-to-bottom reimagining of its product lineup, and its heatsinks have been going under the knife for some time now. The company launched its MasterAir lineup earlier this year with the MasterAir Maker 8, and it's expanding that lineup today with the MasterAir Pro 4 and MasterAir Pro 3 heatsinks. The MasterAir Pro 4 adds a couple new ideas to the winning formula blazed by the Hyper 212 Evo, while the MasterAir Pro 3 is a fresh take on a 92-mm mini-tower. These coolers arrive at a good time. We generally recommend sticking with Intel's stock coolers for CPUs like the Core i3-6100 and the Core i5-6500 in our System Guides, but after working with some of those boxed heatsinks recently, we've come to re-evaluate that recommendation. I'm not sure what's changed between the Haswell and Skylake stock coolers, but the most recent round of Intel boxed heatsinks has a narrow PWM range that makes for a rather noisy system at idle. Some folks might be able to live with that situation, but even the most basic 92-mm cooler is likely to be an improvement over the boxed heatsink. Enter the $40 MasterAir Pro 3. This mini-tower offers three copper heat pipes running through an aluminum base plate. The base uses Cooler Master's fancy "continuous direct contact" design, meaning the heatpipes sit side-by-side for better heat transfer potential. Lesser heatsinks might use three pipes with less-complicated bends that run parallel to one another through an aluminum base. Even better, Cooler Master offsets the Pro 3's fin stack to improve memory clearance. The MasterAir Pro 3's 140-mm-tall stack o' fins is cooled by a 92-mm MasterFan Pro Air Balance fan. These fans use what Cooler Master calls POM bearings, a type of polymer sleeve bearing. As their name might suggest, these fans are meant to strike a balance between static pressure and air flow. That's probably the ideal choice for pushing air through the Pro 3's fin stack. The MasterFans have rubber corners to reduce sympathetic vibration, and the built-in clips on the included fan make for easy installation. Another set of rubber pads on these mounting clips might reduce noise, vibration, and harshness even further.  The $45 MasterAir Pro 4 takes the successful feature set established by the Hyper 212 Evo and makes only a couple of tweaks. This cooler still uses four copper heat pipes with Cooler Master's "continuous direct contact" design, but its base now has a new set of mounting holes that I'll discuss momentarily. The bare aluminum top plate on the Hyper 212 Evo has been replaced with a stealthy black-anodized one, and Cooler Master has switched out the Evo's fan for a MasterFan Pro Air Balance 120-mm unit. The MasterAir Pro 4's fins (and the MasterAir 3's) have a variety of perforations around the heatpipes and a V-shaped array of holes in the center of each layer in the stack that are purported to improve airflow and heat transfer.

Truth be told, no Mac notebook thus far has permitted customers to double the system RAM to a whopping thirty-two gigabytes though many MacBook Pro fans seem to have expected just that as an option. As we told you, Apple on its part did acknowledge that it’d decided against giving the new Pro 32GB RAM because doing so would have decreased the notebook’s battery life. The statement is true, but lacks detail. The Loop’s Dave Mark points us to a more technical explanation for why you cannot outfit your brand spanking new MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM. TL;DR: Skylake platform powering the new MacBook Pro supports DDR4 RAM, but not its LPDDR4 variant that optimizes energy consumption—Apple isn’t lying when it argues that doubling the Pro’s RAM would have a negative impact on battery life. Here’s an interesting excerpt from a Reddit post (edited for clarity): The true reason behind the lack of 32GB RAM on the new MacBook Pro is Intel. Skylake chips do not support LPDDR4 RAM. Kaby Lake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. LPDDR4 stands for a low-power version of DDR4 RAM. Skylake, of course, is Intel’s chip microarchitecture that powers the Pro. Kaby Lake is the name of Intel’s seventh-generation microarchitecture that was unveiled in August. “U category” of chips denotes low-power versions of Intel processors meant for ultra-thin notebooks like the MacBook Air and the twelve-inch MacBook. These chips are typically slower than their non-U counterparts, but conserver more power. In other words, Skylake lacks hardware support for power-sipping RAM chips that could let Apple engineer a 32GB Mac notebook that didn’t sacrifice battery life. The new Pro uses a faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM that consumes more power than the slower 1600 MHz RAM in the previous-generation. You could say that Reddit’s RAM explanation is patently wrong and cite Dell’s XPS 15 as an example, which has the same quad-core Intel Core i7-6700HQ chip from Intel like the new Pro yet packs in 32GB RAM. However, it’s important to note that a) Kaby Lake is required to support DDR4 RAM and B) the Dell machine supports the power-hungrier DDR4 LV RAM technology rather than its low-power LPDDR4 counterpart. An alleged response from Apple’s marketing boss Phil Schiller to a question from a concerned user about the Pro’s RAM situation clarifies that putting more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design “at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook.” The new Pro delivers the same all-day battery life like its predecessor, meaning up to ten hours of wireless web or iTunes movie playback for both 13 and 15-inch models.

SixBanananas Thats what I found on wiki: Dell XPS 15: DDR4 at 2133 MT/s = 1.2V Kaby Lake: Low Power DDR4 at 3200 MT/s (LPDDR3) = 1.1V or by Samsung at 0.6V Old MBP: Low Power DDR3 at 1600 MT/s (LPDDR3) = 1.2V New MBP: Low Power DDR3 at 2133 MT/s (LPDDR3) = 1.8V I don’t get Apples decision or I’m clearly misinformed… Rob Jansen Why would you need 32gb for that weak processor? I have 16gb in my monster of a pc and don’t even come close to needing more. Golicza Alpár But when you hook up multiple 4K screens and run multiple applications on them, you will run out of ram. iPilya I keep hearing people talk about the “weak” CPU. Which mobile CPU should they have used? Kaby Lake (4-core) is not released yet. Braheem Hazeem III 16gb in my x99 6 core CPU desktop PC, which I never fully use. Why would a weak laptop need more than that? Marcus Apple should’ve just made the new MacBook Pro’s twice as thick so that they could put in a bigger battery. The fact that they keep making their MacBook’s thinner and thinner baffles me. There is no need. Reg Guy LOL…clearly someone who doesn’t hump laptops through airports! Jumanji lmao heaven forbid you carry something 4.5 pounds instead of 4. If you’re having a hard time carrying that much weight maybe you should stay home. Marcus I go to the airport several times a year with my laptop. It can be annoying to carry around, but it’s not that much of an inconvenience. Apple should’ve just kept thin MacBook Air’s and then they should’ve made thick MacBook Pro’s. iPilya @marcus_413:disqus the key here is “several times a year”. You are definitely not a traveler. Try saying several times a week. But lets take the airport aspect out of the equation. A person can also reference needing to go client premises several times a week. But if we return back to the Airport aspect… you are limited to the size of battery. While Apple could up the size (would have been nice), but they cannot upsize it all that much. What I don’t know is if Apple maxed out the batter size, could they still have gotten 10 hrs using 32GB of DDR4? mike480 Agreed, there was no need to go any thinner lighter on the new MBP as the previous generation weight and size is not an issue and I carry my laptop through an airport every single week. more ram to run my VM’s would have been so welcome and I was practically expecting it. Marcus Strongly agree. I don’t mind carrying around a laptop that’s 5, 6, or 7 pounds. I want something powerful. foljs Maybe carry a desktop then? mike480 I would have gladly sacrificed some battery life for 32GB ram. While it would be awesome if I got to sit in a park and work all day with no outlet, that just isn’t reality. I don’t need 10 hours battery life and I would argue that the folks who need 10 hours battery number less than us who need 32GB ram. foljs Everybody can use more battery time. Very few have a need for 32GB RAM.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $30 off Sony PlayStation 4 Pro, $70 off Beats Solo3 headphones, and more Apple seeds watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3 to developers Beloved butt-looking peach emoji is back in iOS 10.2 beta 3, looks even more like a butt Jony Ive discusses 20 years of iconic Apple designs and that pricey new coffee table book Apple removed nearly 50,000 apps from App Store in October   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

The modules with Intel® Atom™, Celeron® and Pentium® processors feature the powerful Intel Gen 9 graphics and deliver an impressive performance per watt improvement, enabling the implementation of even more powerful designs with even lower energy consumption. This, combined with long-term availability of 10 years, makes the new high-end low-power modules a perfect fit for both entry level COM Express Compact designs and high-end Qseven platforms. Application areas for the new congatec Computer-on-Modules can be found in many highly specific embedded and IoT systems that require a customized high-performance design and a fanless low-power envelope of 5W to 12W. These include IoT gateways and industrial control systems, machine and device GUIs, medical devices, digital signage systems, vending machines and eMobility stations as well as the entire range of rugged mobile devices, handhelds and in-vehicle systems. Even some standard embedded motherboards use modules to speed up Time-to-Market with system upgrades where only the modules need to be changed. “congatec’s new designs address the entire range of low-power embedded and IoT applications. The two new modules are the spearheads of congatec’s comprehensive roadmap for the latest Intel® Atom™, Celeron® and Pentium® processors based on the highly optimized new 14nm microarchitecture from Intel. A range of standard products such as SMARC 2.0, Pico-ITX and Mini-ITX boards as well as customized carrier boards and full custom designs – of which some are already commissioned – will be released throughout the year,” says Martin Danzer, Director Product Management at congatec AG. “With this extensive range of complementary form factor standards as well as our embedded design and manufacturing services we significantly simplify the development of highly integrated, feature-rich and powerful small form factor applications.” Both form factors will support real-time applications. Those applications will benefit from the hardware integrated IEEE 1588 compliant Precision Time Protocol that can deliver nanosecond synchronization accuracy. Alternative software implementations need microseconds. There is also a hardware integrated audio DSP that can be used for new applications with speech recognition. Another convenient feature is the ability to switch from a static, hardware-based PCIe lane configuration to a flexible software-based setup which makes it possible to use the predefined GbE lanes of the modules also for other purposes. The feature sets at a glance The new real-time capable congatec Qseven and COM Express Compact modules come with particularly energy-saving Intel® Atom™ processors E3930, E3940 and E3950 for the industrial-grade extended temperature range of -40° C to +85° C, or are fitted with the more powerful low-power dual-core Intel® Celeron® N3350 and quad-core Intel® Pentium® N4200 processors. A highlight is that the industrial-grade module variants with Intel Atom processors have a lidded cooling interface which connects directly to the processor.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 31, 2016 at 10:57AM In the past, microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) product methodology was known as tick-tock. This strategy was very simple to understand: In alternating years, the company produced a product known either as a "tick" or a "tock." A "tick" essentially boiled down to Intel's taking a prior-generation chip design, making some minor enhancements to said design, and then building it in a brand-new chip manufacturing technology. After a "tick" would come a "tock." A "tock" involved Intel's making significant changes to the underlying design of the processor architecture. However, that all-new architecture would be implemented in largely the same manufacturing process as the prior-generation "tick" product was. The new development methodology at Intel is known as process-architecture-optimization (let's use the commonly used abbreviation "PAO"). The "process" and "architecture" steps basically correspond to the "tick" and "tock" steps, respectively. The wrinkle is that, going forward, the company intends to add a third step, known as "optimization." Based on the first "optimization," it seems that with this step Intel doesn't make significant changes to the underlying processor architecture and instead relies on enhancements to the manufacturing technology to ultimately deliver better product performance. Considering this, it's important that, going forward, Intel delivers essentially game-changing innovations with each of its "architecture" steps, beginning with a product known as Icelake. Core 2 Duo -- the very first "tock" in Intel's now-defunct tick-tock development methodology. Image source: Intel.  Intel now has more time to work on its processor cores Intel is known to have two major processor core teams. The first is part of Intel's Israel Development Center, or IDC. The second is part of Intel's Hillsboro, Ore., site, known as the Converged Core Development Organization, or CCDO for short. These teams work on new processor cores in a staggered fashion. For example, CCDO developed the Haswell and Broadwell CPU cores that were used in Intel's 2013 and 2014 processor families. IDC developed the Skylake and Cannonlake cores -- the latter likely to be a mild enhancement to the Skylake core -- that Intel has been using since the second half of 2015 and will persist probably until late 2018 or early 2019. That Intel now plans to use the same fundamental core design for three years, rather than two, means that the company's core development teams now have more time to work on each new processor core. More time should mean more aggressive scope With additional time to work on these processor cores, Intel's architects should be able to add more features and deliver larger performance boosts generation over generation than they could previously. An extra year of development time is quite a lot and could mean much larger generational improvements. These future cores must last longer in the marketplace than their predecessors did. In a sense, if Intel wants to be sure that its processors continue to offer industry-leading performance, it's going to have to take larger architectural leaps.

Based on the data shown here, it's clear that Intel's new architectures deliver roughly a 10% boost in performance per clock while its similar architecture on new process cores achieves roughly 5% improvements on that same metric. Going forward, I think with the additional development time, Intel could achieve more along the lines of a 15%-17% performance per clock with each new architecture, beginning with Icelake, while getting around a 6%-8% improvement with the follow-on version of that core. These improvements, coupled with potential clock speed increases thanks to improved manufacturing technologies and more aggressive improvements in other areas of the chip, such as graphics, could allow Intel to deliver very compelling new products with each product generation.

By Conner Forrest | October 31, 2016, 7:44 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: James Martin/CNET When Tim Cook and company took the stage in late October to announce the latest iteration of the MacBook Pro line, the most alluring feature was the new Touch Bar and Touch ID integration. The Touch Bar is multi-touch retina display that replaced the area normally reserved for the function keys, and allows for customization. However, the Touch Bar brings with it another new feature of the MacBook Pro—an ARM processor. The core computing functions in the MacBook Pro are handled by a standard Intel chip (core i5 or i7), but a standalone T1 ARM chip handles the security for the Touch Bar, Touch ID, and the camera, implementing Apple's Secure Enclave. So, what exactly is the T1 chip? As noted by developer Steven Troughton-Smith on Twitter, the T1 is "very similar to S1," which is the chip that runs the Apple Watch. However, what may be even more interesting, Troughton-Smith wrote, is that the Touch Bar seems to be running the watchOS, or a variant of it. SEE: Apple's new MacBook Pro: 4 things professionals need to know Additionally, there may also be some evidence that the Touch Bar itself is independent from macOS Sierra, and could potentially run while the machine is turned off, as reported by The Verge. Although, that doesn't mean they don't work together. Currently, the two operating systems send data back and forth, which allows macOS to relay relevant information about touch events back to the Touch Bar, Troughton-Smith wrote. Regardless, the addition of the ARM processor to handle certain functions frees up the traditional Intel processor for more compute-intensive tasks, so the processor won't be bogged down by the Touch Bar and Touch ID. The inclusion of a secondary processor opens up a lot of possibilities for the future of the MacBook line. Of course, we could potentially see ARM-powered peripherals, such as a wireless keyboard with Touch ID. If the technology advanced enough, though, it might even be possible for us to see a fuller version of iOS embedded within a MacBook Pro, furthering the productivity of tools such as Continuity, which Apple introduced with Mac OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. SEE: Apple MacBook Pro 2016: The smart person's guide Despite the hype Apple built around the Touch Bar, the guidelines for developing with it are somewhat limiting. According to Apple's official documentation, "The Touch Bar shouldn't display alerts, messages, scrolling content, static content, or anything else that commands the user's attention or distracts from their work on the main screen." That could kill some of the potential productivity provided for business users, but Apple could eventually back off of that if it receives enough pushback. As of the time of this writing, the Touch Bar hasn't hit the public market yet, so it is unclear how it will be received. While some have lauded Apple for the design, others have questioned why the company didn't simply introduce a full touch screen Mac. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The new MacBook Pro has both an Intel core processor and an ARM processor to help handle the Touch Bar and Touch ID functions. The secondary ARM processor could open up new possibilities for MacBooks in the future, with additional features for continuity and peripheral devices. It is unclear how the market will respond to Apple's Touch Bar, as many called for a full touch screen Mac. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Apple Weekly newsletter.

One such project, the Wheelie, allows users to control a wheelchair using only their facial expressions. Designed by Paulo Gurgel Pinheiro -- a Brazil-based Intel® Innovator, co-founder and CEO of HOOBOX Robotics -- Wheelie could radically improve the lives of millions whose mobility has been compromised by ALS, quadriplegia, and stroke. Motherboard spoke with Pinheiro about the promise of 3D cameras, and its potential to help us “hack disability.” Can you give me a little background on yourself? I got my PhD in computer science and robotics in 2013. My focus was on developing localization solutions for mobile robots. You know Roomba, the robots that clean the floor autonomously? At that time, when I was in school, they were not able to go from point A to point B on their own. We built a solution for this. Afterwards, I started a postdoc program, which is when I began working with wheelchairs. We put that same localization system into wheelchairs, basically. What do you mean by “localization”? In order for a robot to go from point A to B autonomously, it first has to know where it is to start with. And it has to locate itself very quickly, because Roomba is supposed to clean the floor, not spend forever trying to find its poles. This is the problem we solved. With Roomba, we installed a very cheap, tiny camera, which uses AI to match what it sees with a map of the house. But with the wheelchair, we have an Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera, which allows us to do the localization really fast. Localization is one thing we can do, but it’s not really the heart of Wheelie. Facial mapping. Hoo-box.com Alright, tell us what Wheelie is all about. Wheelie is the first computer program that can translate facial expressions into commands that can be sent to a wheelchair, allowing a disabled person to control its movements. We place an Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera in front of the user, which records their facial expressions; so when the user smiles, for instance, the camera records certain points around the mouth. Our software then classifies those points, recognizing that the user is performing a smile, and then translates that smile into a command for the wheelchair. So when the user smiles, the wheelchair will stop, for example. This entire process occurs in less than 0.7 seconds. It’s just not something you can do with 2D cameras. When someone uses it for the first time, do you have to calibrate it so the program recognizes that person’s particular way of smiling? No, it understands that the mathematics behind your smile is the same as my smile, even though we look different. This is the artificial intelligence in our classifier, which behaves like us. For example, I may never have seen a person before, but I'm able to recognize when a person is raising their eyebrows or giving a kiss. Wheelie uses the same behavior to interact with people. What kind of hardware and software are you using? For the camera, we use an Intel® RealSense™ F200. Recently, Intel demoed the Euclid, which is a wireless RealSense camera with a self-contained PC, all about the size of a candy bar. I'm very excited to get one next year and start running Wheelie with it. Actually, Wheelie could be a feature inside Euclid, which people with disabilities could use to control anything at home with facial expressions. The set-up also requires an onboard computer. The one we use is an Intel® NUC, a mini PC that fits on the back of the wheelchair. The next step this year will be to get Wheelie running on the Intel® RealSense™ Robotic Development Kit, which is a smaller PC for RealSense cameras. We hope to do it this year. For the software, we use the Intel® RealSense™ SDK to get those points on the face -- 78 in total. Even though the SDK comes with some programs that recognize facial expressions, we decided to build our own classifier to get that 0.7 second response time. Is there particular significance to 0.7 seconds? Yes. We can actually do it faster, but it can’t be too fast because users need time to make an expression and then observe the wheelchair responding. We’ve found that 0.7 seconds feels natural and comfortable to most people. How important has user feedback been to designing it? When I started my postdoc program, I had to develop an interface to control a wheelchair. So we tried a lot of things, like putting sensors on the user’s face, or goggles with cameras that track eye movement -- anything to make a wheelchair move. But when we talked to people with ALS, stroke victims or quadriplegics, many said they don't want to use any body sensors. First, they would need someone to put the sensors on every time. Second, it's not comfortable. And third, you can't go in public with a lot of sensors on your face and neck and head. But we didn't have another solution. Moving around your home or office requires some delicate and complex maneuvers. Without body sensors, our program was just too inefficient. Then I started working with Intel® RealSense™ last July. I built a very good classifier to use with it, which became the solution. Without using any body sensors, we have maintained -- improved, actually -- the efficiency of the program. Hoo-box.com What was the biggest challenge you ran into? To classify facial expressions. That was our main challenge. Especially tricky expressions like a half-smile. People have different abilities, of course; I can perform a smile comfortably, but for someone who has suffered a stroke, for example, it’s not so easy. We work with some people with ALS, for instance, who cannot raise their eyebrows. So we had to improve the classifier to recognize other key expressions, like half-smile. Half-smile works great for stroke victims; it's one of the favorite facial expressions people use. Every time we talk to a user, we get ideas about new expressions we could put in our classifier. So far, we have up to 7. You can choose the expression you want to assign to each command. Kiss to move forward, raise eyebrows to turn right, smile to stop, etc. But if you can’t perform that many expressions, it's ok, too; we designed a circular menu with highlighting buttons that requires just two facial expressions to use. Another challenge was to make it possible to use Wheelie in different lighting conditions. We want to to use it in a bright room with a lot of light, but in a dark room, it's supposed to work as well. It took a lot of work to do this, as well as put it all together in a comfortable interface. How do you know when the user is smiling at a joke or smiling to control the chair? First off, we have voice recognition that allows them to enable and disable the interface anytime they want, so they can react normally without interfering with the system. But to answer your question, we can’t tell when a person is smiling to control the wheelchair or smiling at a joke they heard. That's why we always use smile to stop the wheelchair: for safety. We can tell when a person is coughing or sneezing, though. We have a classifier for this, so it won’t interfere with the system. It's so elegant. We know when people are going to cough before they do it, but smiling is trickier. How do you see this technology improving lives of people with disabilities? There are more than 3 million people in the world that would benefit from the Wheelie: people with ALS, quadriplegia, victims of stroke, etc. Every year, more than 400,000 people worldwide are going to suffer an injury, many of whom could benefit from the Wheelie. What we started to do here was to develop a mobility solution. But now we know that Wheelie is more than that: The users are not only improving their mobility, but also their self-esteem and their autonomy. This has become more important to us. It’s a good thing we did not expect to happen. 3D cameras are able to interact with people in a very natural and comfortable way. Using this technology, I think we have a chance to, as I like to say, “hack disability,” just like one hacks a computer to install software to make it run better. If I can provide a Wheelie to improve a person’s mobility, and then this user can interact more with people, decreasing their isolation, closing that social gap between them and others, I'll be happy.

In advance of the desktop launch, as is typical with how CPUs are launched, Intel has to send out qualification and near-retail samples to partners for pre-testing of release systems. Typically this is kept under wraps, without official public announcements (it's up to you how many of the leaks you want to believe), but late last week Intel sent out a 'Product Change Notification' through its online/public channels, with details about a good portion (no way to tell if it is all the SKUs) of Intel's Core i7 and Core i5-7000 series parts. Within the PCN, Intel notified its customers about an additional assembly/packaging site for its desktop Kaby Lake-S chips in Vietnam and therefore had to disclose model numbers of the CPUs as well as some of the specifications. In addition, in a separate PCN detailing package adjustments for how chipset ICs are shipped, it would seem that Intel has also mentioned names of its upcoming 200-series chipsets. Gallery: Intel Discloses Kaby Lake-S Lineup, Base Frequencies According to Intel’s document for partners, the company intends to release at least 11 quad-core processors for desktops based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture in Q1. What is noteworthy is that the company wants its customers to get ready to receive the first shipments of the KBL-S chips assembled in Vietnam starting from November 4, 2016, this week (which means that the final specs of the new processors have been set and will only be changed in extreme circumstances). The initial KBL-S lineup would seem to include three Core i7 SKUs, seven Core i5 CPUs as well as one Xeon E3 v6 product. (The fact that a Xeon v6 is included in this is interesting, given that Intel removed standard chipset support for Xeon E3 CPUs with Skylake and v5, meaning that both consumer and enterprise platforms are due to land in January.) All the Kaby Lake-S processors will use the B0 stepping of the core, and will have 100-300 MHz higher base frequency compared to their Skylake-S counterparts. The PCN does not explicitly state the TDP, however we do not expect much to change given the slightly improved 14+ nm technology and the increased frequencies (same thing applies to cache size, which has been consistent for several generations). We have already observed that mobile Kaby Lake CPUs have higher clock rates compared to their predecessors due to enhancements of Intel’s 14+ nm process technology, and we see that their desktop brethren also have improvements on this front. We do not have the final Turbo frequencies at hand, but we expect them to be considerably higher than the base clock rates.

SR2MU Pentium G3920 2.9 GHz *CPU details taken from this piece at PCOnline Aside from the 14+ process offering higher frequencies, the base microarchitecture of Kaby Lake-S, as explained at the release of Kaby Lake-Y/U in September, is essentially the same as Skylake. However, on top of increasing the frequencies, Intel is also adding in Speed Shift v2 which allows for much quicker adjustments in CPU frequency over Skylake (down to 10ms rather than 30ms). It remains to be seen is whether the new 14+ process technology will also enable considerably higher overclocking potential compared to existing CPUs. If it does, then the new chips have a chance to become rather popular among enthusiasts, potentially toppling the i7-2600K as a long term favorite. It might be noted is that Intel’s Kaby Lake-S will have to compete not only against their predecessors, but also against AMD’s Zen products due in Q1. That being said, some would argue that given AMD's recent presentation of certain benchmark metrics, Zen is geared more towards the high-end desktop crowd. Nevertheless, it looks like early 2017 is going to be an interesting time for microprocessors. 200-Series Chipsets In addition to model numbers of its Kaby Lake CPUs, Intel also revealed the names of its 200-series chipsets in another document it sent to partners. As expected, the lineup will include the Z270 PCH for enthusiast-class PCs with overclocking capabilities; Q270, H270 and H250 for mainstream systems and B250 for office/business computers.  Intel 200-Series Chipsets Name Socket Stepping Product Code S-Spec Intel H270 LGA1151 A0 GL82H270 SR2WA Intel Z270 GL82Z270 SR2WB Intel B250 GL82B250 SR2WC Intel Q250 GL82Q250 SR2WD Intel Q270 GL82Q270 SR2WE   Intel C422 LGA1151? A0 GL82C422 SR2WG Intel X299 ?!? A0 GL82X299 SR2Z2 Also in the list of chipsets were a couple of unknowns as well. Listed in the PCN is C422, which because it has a 'C' in the name means that this is typically geared towards workstations and Xeon platforms. This may be in line with the E3-1205 v6 CPU SKU as seen in the processor list. Also is X299, which really throws up a few question marks. The X-series chipsets are typically for Intel's High-End Desktop Platform (HEDT), and we've had X58, X79 and X99 in the last decade, from Nehalem up to Broadwell-E which was released back in May. This means either one of two things - either Intel is bringing the X nomenclature to Kaby Lake, the mainstream platform, or this is the next chipset for HEDT and the future Skylake-E series of processors. The first option in making X299 a Kaby Lake-related platform seems a little odd. However the second one, with Skylake-E, makes sense. After X99, the X119 name doesn't have the same marketability (if Intel was to keep parity with number jumps), but by pushing Skylake-E onto the 200-series naming as X299, it moves both mainstream and HEDT chipset naming strategies onto the same track. Note that we don't have a time-frame for Skylake-E as of yet. Intel’s motherboard customers, given the Q1 launch, must be ready to receive the 200-series PCH ICs on new reels. According to the PCN, these will come with additional protections bands starting from December 2, 2016. Intel may or may not announce the whole 200-series (not X) lineup at CES, given this late in the day adjustment to core components for the motherboards.  As for improvements of the Intel 200-series chipsets, we are still waiting on official confirmation as to exactly what to expect. Various unconfirmed leaks have indicated additional PCIe 3.0 chipset lanes, some new platform features and support for Intel’s Optane SSDs, however we will be here for the official launch when the time comes. It might be worth noting that almost all the motherboard manufacturers have now formally announced new 100-series BIOS support for Kaby Lake CPUs, meaning not all enthusiasts will have to get new motherboards.

POST A COMMENT 71 Comments View All Comments Lolimaster - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link 12% performance increas is just from the increased clocks, this things don't even deserve news. Reply ikjadoon - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link I wonder if this is even good for overclockers. We would presume, on a "better" process, they got higher MHz at lower voltages (to stay within that 95W TDP envelope). But...honestly.....the i5-6600K (rated at 91W) maxes out around 70W. Technically, Intel may have just pre-overclocked Skylake a smidgen. If true, they'll run hotter than Skylake...because they just raised the voltage a smidgen, too. Well, this is a win for non-overclockers, though. Intel finally gives them that 'free performance that overclockers enjoy. Reply saratoga4 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link >Technically, Intel may have just pre-overclocked Skylake a smidgen. FWIW, my Skylake system hit 4.5 GHz ... at stock voltage. I wonder if they've improved the TIM like on Devil's Canyon. Reply etamin - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link Luck of the draw. My 6700K needs 1.344V to hit 4.5GHz and refuses to go any higher no matter the voltage. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link My 6600k needs 1.44 Vcore at 4.6GHz to not bluescreen on the x264 stress test. It will also begin underclocking itself before the first pass finishes, as it hits 95C or so. I have it in a small form factor build, with a Thermalright AXP-100R with the fan replaced by a very large 140mm*26mm fan. The heatsink is rated for 180W TDP. So the thermals on extremely CPU intensive workloads like x264 aren't good. So yeah, I don't feel the TIM used under the integrated heat spreader is good at all. I've tried different thermal compounds over the integrated heat spreader, but none are effective at preventing the inevitable throttling that happens over a lengthy 100% utilized CPU stress test. That being said, it'll only be used for gaming, and no games stress the CPU 100% of the time, at worst it'll be ~75C in game benchmarks, which is perfectly acceptable. So I'm OK with the CPU melting (but stable) in unrealistic workloads, since it's just fine and never throttles on actual realistic workloads. Reply Byte - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link Maybe you should delid and put liquid ultra. It decreased temps over 10C. Its pretty easy, i just did 6 chips in a row. Didn't really help my overclocks that much though. Reply Notmyusualid - Tuesday, November 01, 2016 - link 1 for that. My Alienware 18 had been throttling constantly out in the Asian heat - if I even mentioned the word overclock. (Tmax for 4940XM is a mere 100C) Added Collabrotory Liquid Ultra, max temp is 85 - 87C now - and my basclock is upped to 4.1GHz too! Honestly that much of a difference. I wonder if the Dell tech was using toothpaste, (or more likely just had a bad batch of thermal insulaton paste?). Reply Macpoedel - Tuesday, November 01, 2016 - link You're talking about a laptop, you don't have to delid those (seeing as those processors come without a lid). You just changed the thermal paste as you would when installing a heatsink on a desktop. The problem with desktop processors is that you have a double layer of thermal paste, first between the actual chip and the lid, then between the lid and the heatsink. When Intel decided to cheap out on the paste between the chip and the lid, thermal performance has gone way down. But anyway, it's true that Dell isn't known for using good thermal paste (and for applying it properly). Reply Byte - Tuesday, November 08, 2016 - link They need something easy to put on for thousands upon thousands of systems, fast and hard to screw up. Toothpaste fits the bill. Or you wouldn't see dozen of companies selling thermal paste, I mean such a niche product! Reply colinstalter - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link I am able to hit 4.7GHz on my 6600k at stock voltages. I use a corsair single-fan liquid cooler and have yet to get over 55-60 C during stress tests.

MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? Britta O'Boyle31 October 2016Laptops Apple / Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Decided you want an Apple laptop, but you're not sure which one is the right one for you? You've come to the right place. With seven MacBook models available before you even consider configuration options, it's not an easy decision, or a simple one. This feature rounds up all the MacBooks models offered through Apple, from the 12-inch MacBook to the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, to help you work out what each model offers, how much they cost, how they can be configured and what their pros and cons are. Read on to find out which Apple MacBook is the one for you. Quick summary The MacBook is the smallest, lightest and most portable MacBook available, but it is also the most restrictive in terms of ports and power. The MacBook Air is the cheapest MacBook available overall, and the lightest option for those after a little more power, larger screen and the convenience of ports. Its screen isn't as impressive as any of the other options but it does offer the longest battery life. The MacBook Pro (2015) 13-inch is the cheapest way to get your hands on the more powerful Pro range of MacBooks, and it offers ports, along with a Retina display. It's larger and heavier than the new Pro models though so less portable than the likes of the Air. The MacBook Pro (2016) 13-inch without Touch Bar is lighter and smaller than the older 13-inch Pro model, while offering more storage as standard and a brighter display. It doesn't offer the Touch Bar or Touch ID, and although it has two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of a single USB Type-C port like the MacBook, it is still restrictive in the port department. The MacBook Pro (2016) 13-inch with Touch Bar is the model for those who want the power, the new lighter design, Touch Bar and Touch ID functionality, as well as more Thunderbolt 3 ports. It comes at a cost though, with a starting price of £300 more than the model without the Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro (2015) 15-inch is the cheapest way to get your hands on an even larger Pro model, with all the ports still intact and a Retina display. As with the older 13-inch model though, it is larger and heavier than the new Pro models, storage configuration tops out at 1TB and its screen isn't as bright as the new Pros. The MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar is the king of the MacBooks with the best power and largest storage options, biggest screen, new design and the Touch Bar and Touch ID features. It is also the most expensive however and this probably isn't the MacBook you'll want if you're constantly on the move. Apple Apple MacBook Dimensions: 280.5 x 196.5 x 35-131mm, 920g Display: 12-inches, 2304 x 1440 (226ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: One USB Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1249 to £1684 The MacBook is the smallest, lightest and most portable of the MacBook family, but it has the smallest display and it's not as powerful as the MacBook Air or any of the MacBook Pro models. The base model features a 1.1GHz Intel Core m3 processor and 256GB of storage, while the highest spec available offers a 1.3GHz Intel Core m7 processor and 512GB of storage. All configurations have Intel HD Graphics 515 and 8GB of RAM. The MacBook only has one USB Type-C port, which supports charging, USB 3.1, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA output and HDMI video output. This means it isn't the most convenient MacBook for those that need to connect lots of devices, whether that's a camera, or an adapter to allow for the transfer of images from an SD card. It comes in Rose Gold, Space Grey, Gold and Silver colour options, all of which have a 480p FaceTime camera. Apple MacBook (2016) review: Is port-free still the future? Apple Apple MacBook Air Dimensions: 325 x 227 x 30-170mm, 1.35kg Display: 13.3-inches, 1400 x 900 (125ppi) Connections: Two USB 3 ports, Thunderbolt 2 port, MagSafe power port, SDXC card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 12 hours Price: From £949 to £1409 The MacBook Air is the oldest of the MacBook family and although it is no longer the slimmest, it is the lightest MacBook available for those after power and a larger display. It is also the cheapest MacBook and the only one to start under the £1000 mark. The base model has a 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 128GB of storage, while the top-spec available has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 chip and 512GB of storage. All model configurations feature Intel HD Graphics 6000 and 8GB of RAM.  The MacBook Air is a lot more flexible than the MacBook when it comes to ports, meaning you'll not only be able to pop in an SD card to transfer images, but you'll be able to charge your MacBook Air while doing so, or connecting to another device. For some, one port on the MacBook will be enough, for others it will be a pain, which is where the Air steps in. The MacBook Air comes in Silver and it features a 720p FaceTime camera, meaning video calls will be crisper than on the MacBook. Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (2013) review Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2015) Dimensions: 314 x 219 x 180mm, 1.58kg Display: 13.3-inches, 2560 x 1600 (226ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: Two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, MagSafe 2 power port, HDMI port, SDXC card slot 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1249 to £2419 The MacBook Pro family now consists of five options and last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro is the cheapest in the Pro portfolio. It is heavier and larger than the MacBook, MacBook Air, and the two newer 13-inch MacBook Pros, but it retains those connections, which may come in useful for some. The base model has a 2.7GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model available has a 3.1GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. All configurations feature Intel Iris Graphics 6000. Like the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro (2015) features more flexibility than the MacBook when it comes to ports, as we mentioned. It adds a HDMI port, along with an extra Thunderbolt 2 port to its features in comparison to the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro (2015) comes in Silver and it has a 720p FaceTime camera, like the MacBook Air. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina display (early 2015) review: May the Force be with you Apple MacBook Pro (2016) vs MacBook Pro (2015): What's the difference? Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2016) - Without Touch Bar and Touch ID Dimensions: 304.1 x 212.4 x 149mm, 1.37kg Display: 13.3-inches, 2560 x 1600 (226ppi), 500nits brightness Connections: Two Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £1449 to £2439 This year's 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is the model for those who want the power, aren't fussed about the lack of ports and don't want the Touch Bar and Touch ID, or perhaps don't have the budget for them. The base model has a 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-of-the-range model has a 2.4GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. All configurations have Intel Iris Graphics 540. Like the MacBook, this 13-inch MacBook Pro lacks in the port department, though it does have two Thunderbolt 3 ports over one USB Type-C port, meaning you'll at least be able to charge it, while connecting to another device.  The MacBook Pro (2016) without Touch Bar and Touch ID is available in Silver or Space Gray, comes with a 720p FaceTime camera like last year's MacBook Pro and Air and has two microphones.

The base model has a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model has a 3.1GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. All configurations have Intel Iris Graphics 550. Like the MacBook and MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, this 13-inch MacBook Pro says bye-bye to the ports again. It does however offer more than the previous two models, with four Thunderbolt 3 ports. You'll still need adapters to transfer images from an SD card for example, but the extra ports will allow you to do more simultaneously than you could do with the MacBook especially, but also the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar and Touch ID is available in Silver or Space Gray, comes with a 720p FaceTime camera and has three microphones. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2015) Dimensions: 358.9 x 247.1 x 180mm, 2.04kg Display: 15.4-inches, 2880 x 1800 (220ppi), 300nits brightness Connections: Two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, MagSafe 2 power port, HDMI port, SDXC card slot 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 9 hours Price: From £1899 to £2709 Last year's 15-inch MacBook Pro the cheaper option for those who want the power, larger screen and the ports, but aren't necessarily as fussed about the latest and greatest features. The base model has a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The top-specced model available has a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 1TB of storage. All configurations feature 16GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Like the MacBook Pro (2015) 13-inch, the MacBook Pro (2015) 15-inch features more flexibility than the MacBook and new MacBook Pros when it comes to ports, as we mentioned. It adds a HDMI port, along with an extra Thunderbolt 2 port to its features in comparison to the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro (2015) comes in Silver, has a 720p FaceTime camera, like the MacBook Air and offers two microphones. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) vs MacBook Pro (2015): What's the difference? Apple Apple MacBook Pro (2016) - With Touch Bar and Touch ID Dimensions: 349.3 x 240.7 x 155mm, 1.83kg Display: 15.4-inches, 2880 x 1800 (220ppi), 500nits brightness Connections: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3.5mm headphone jack Battery: 10 hours Price: From £2349 to £4049 The new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID is MacBook for those after the power, the large screen and the latest and greatest features Apple has to offer. You'll need the budget with this one though.  The base model has a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 256GB of storage and Radeon Pro 450 graphics. The top-specced model available has a 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 2TB of storage and Radeon Pro 460 graphics. All configurations feature 16GB of RAM. As with the 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016), you'll need to make sure you allow for buying any adapters you might need because the ports are limited to just Thunderbolt 3, though you at least get a few extra compared to the MacBook's singular USB Type-C port and the two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro (2016) comes in Silver and Space Grey, has three microphones, and it has a 720p FaceTime camera, like all the other MacBooks, except the 12-inch MacBook.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web UK-based AI startup raises $30 million to compete with Intel and Nvidia By Anthony Spadafora Graphcore has raised $30 million to compete against Intel and Nvidia in the field of chips for AI applications. Shares A UK-based startup aiming to compete against Intel and Nvidia in designing chips for artificial intelligence (AI) applications has raised $30 million in funding in order to launch its new processors. The company, which hopes to disrupt the current chip market, is called Graphcore and is planning to ship its chips to companies in a wide variety of fields including cloud computing and driverless cars sometime next year. The company is claiming that its processors will be up to 100 times faster than its competitors when it comes to teaching AI systems how to learn. Not only that, the chips will also be more energy efficient. Today's machine learning applications utilise high-end graphic processing units (GPUs) in order to handle the vast number of computations they perform. Nigel Toon, Graphcore's CEO, believes that this will not be the case going forward and that his company's chips will power these applications in the future. Toon explained how GPUs are not ideal for machine learning, saying: “GPUs have been built to run programs that completely describe the algorithm. Machine learning is different. You are trying to teach the system using data and that requires a different style of compute.” This is why Graphcore has developed a new type of chip it calls an Intelligent Processing Unit (IPU) that will come to market in 2017. The company has spent two years working on this new technology with the goal of reducing data centre costs while at the same time making them more efficient. Graphcore's chips could be used to not only run a data centre, but also to train AI systems during a server's downtime. Deep learning is a quickly growing market that will see continued growth going forward, with the marketing intelligence firm Tractica predicting that $41.5 billion will be spent on the hardware needed to power deep learning projects by 2024. Toon offered more details regarding the companies current investors, saying: “We have Bosch as a strategic investor, we have Samsung as an investor and Bosch is interested in autonomous vehicles and the next generation of transportation, while Samsung is interested in missing word edge of network devices. We are working with partners on some these other applications.”  Image Credit: Wichy / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Microsoft Surface Studio is a bold device aimed at winning more creatives over to the Windows way of life. (Photo: Screen grab from Tested/Youtube) Microsoft Surface Studio all-in-one computer announced as "out of stock" for pre-order on Saturday, October 29, 2016. Shortages of stocks are due to influx of orders. The shipment of deliveries will resume early on 2017. The three models of Microsoft surface studio: 1TB/Intel core i5/8GB RAM, 1TB/ Intel core i7/16GB RAM and 2TB/Intel core i7/32GB RAM, has been delayed for deliveries and unavailable for pre-order for the moment. The Intel core i5 models are scheduled for shipment in December and the Intel core i7 models are for early 2017. Some customers are disappointed about the shortages of the products' stocks, especially for those who pan for the coming Christmas for gifts. The company was overwhelmed on the high demand for the Microsoft Surface Studio but seems had mistaken on calculating the cautions when it comes to production. The company didn't disclose any details of the availability of the products. The price starts at $2,999.00 for the cheaper model up to $4,199.00 for the highest end model of Microsoft Surface Studio. The all-in-one computer introduced by Microsoft at the 'Window's 10' event last Wednesday, October 26, 2016. Due to the intimidating aspects, especially for artists and designers, the unexpected demand from people cause the pushed back f shipments schedule and shortage of inventory. One of the new technologies in the Microsoft Surface Studio is its device called 'Surface Dial'. It is a big puck that is works like a modern paint palette. When it is placed on the model's screen, a radial menu will pops up around it. Different brush and colour options for the user, as example, when a painting app is on screen, other apps create custom menus as well. It can also be used to navigate and pan around an image. There's still no announcement for the official release date of the Microsoft Surface Studio. However, if the pre-orders deliveries delayed, expect the same for the release date of the products.

Review The entry-level, 13-inch MacBook Pro doesn't have the buzz-worthy Touch Bar everyone is talking about, but that doesn't mean this isn't a formidable laptop. For $1,499, you get a brighter and more colorful screen than the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, a bigger touchpad, louder speakers, and speedier performance, all wrapped up in a design that's thinner, lighter and smaller than its predecessor. The battery life is pretty awesome, too. article continued below If you wanted an adaptive, multi-touch screen above the keyboard that provides all sorts of nifty shortcuts, you'd have to fork over $1,799 for the Touch Bar model. Is the more affordable new MacBook Pro we reviewed worth it? Yes, but it isn't as fast as cheaper Windows laptops with Intel's newer 7th-generation processors, and Apple ditched some useful ports to achieve this svelte design. Editors' Note: After retesting the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar multiple times, we've determined that the battery life is just under 10 hours and not 12 hours as originally reported. This is in line with Apple's claims. Design: Honey, I Shrunk the MacBook Pro The new MacBook Pro looks both classic and modern, but I wouldn't call it thrilling. The aluminum body is certainly compact, as it has 23 percent less volume and is 17 percent thinner than the last 13-inch Pro. There is remarkable precision at work here, including the tiny speaker perforations that flank the keyboard, which give the deck a striking symmetry. Then there's the perfectly carved lip, which makes opening the lid effortless. If I had to choose, I'd opt for the new Space Gray color over the Silver, as the former hue has a more sophisticated vibe. But I do wish Apple would be a little more daring with its use of materials; for example, I like the way Dell uses carbon fiber on the inside of the XPS 13 to achieve a soft-touch feel. This is one of the brightest displays around, registering 495 nits in our testing. Measuring 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.58 inches and weighing 3.02 pounds, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller in every dimension than the previous model, which weighed 3.42 pounds and measured 12.35 x 8.62 x 0.71 inches. Still, 13-inch Windows ultraportables weigh less and are just as thin or thinner, such as the 2.7-pound Dell XPS 13 (11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33-0.6 inches) and the 2.8-pound HP Spectre x360 (12.03 x 8.58 x 0.54 inches). The 13.9-inch Yoga 910 measures 12.72 x 8.84 x 0.56 inches and weighs 3.04 pounds. Ports: Too Minimalist I hope you like dongles. This 13-inch MacBook Pro sports two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the left and a headphone jack on the right. The good news is that the Thunderbolt 3 ports, which have a USB-C connector, enable power and data over a single connection. They offer blazing fast transfer speeds (up to 40 Gbps) and will let you connect two 4K monitors. You must charge the laptop using either one of the two ports, as Apple has retired its MagSafe connection. (If you wanted to spend $1,799 on the Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro, you'd get 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports.) Unfortunately, Apple got rid of the SD card slot, which means you'll need to use a USB-C card reader or connect your camera directly to the laptop using a dongle. The similarly-thin HP Spectre x360 and Yoga 910 also ditch the SD card but manage to include one full-size USB port. The thicker XPS 13 includes two USB 3 ports, an SD Card reader and one Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. MORE: Thunderbolt 3 Explained: Why You Need the World's Fastest Port Apple sells a $69 USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter that includes connections for HDMI and a full-size USB port for connecting devices like the iPhone, cameras and other peripherals. You can also pick up a USB-C to USB adapter for $19, but there's also plenty of third-party options that are cheaper. The MacBook Pro isn't as speedy as Windows ultraportables with 7th-generation Intel processors. Display: Super Bright and Colorful Apple says that the 2560 x 1600-pixel Retina display on the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 67 percent brighter than before. We didn't see that much of a difference, but this is still one of the brightest panels around; it registered 495 nits in our testing, which is significantly higher than the 385 nits on the last model. By comparison, the Dell XPS 13 hit just 302 nits, the HP Spectre x360 317 nits and the Lenovo Yoga 910 292 nits. This display also offers rich colors, as evidenced when I downloaded a 4K photo of a sunrise shot through a wave. I saw vibrant blues, greens, yellows and oranges. When watching the Rogue One trailer, I could make out every scratch on a box a rebel was hiding behind, as well as the drops of sweat on his forehead. My only complaint when watching video is that I wish the black levels were higher. These are the best speakers I've heard on this size laptop. On our tests, this screen reproduced 113 percent of the sRGB color gamut (higher numbers are better) while turning in a Delta-E color accuracy score of 1.0 (closer to 0 is best). This makes the MacBook Pro's display more colorful but not quite as accurate as the XPS 13 (93.6 percent, 0.76 Delta-E), Spectre x360 (101, 0.74) and Yoga 910 (98, 0.76). Audio: Best in Class Whether you like to binge watch Netflix, rock out on Spotify or hear every detail in that movie you're scoring in Final Cut Pro, you'll love the improved stereo speakers on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, these are the best speakers I've heard on this size laptop. Apple redesigned the speakers to deliver twice the dynamic range and three times the peak power while minimizing distortion. When I played "Don't Wanna Know" by Maroon 5 and Kendrick Lamar at max volume, Adam Levine's soaring falsetto sounded crystal clear. On Twenty One Pilots' "Heathens," the bass line had plenty of bunch which never got lost amidst Tyler Joseph's vocals. Keyboard and Touchpad: A Better Butterfly Unless you've used the 12-inch MacBook's keyboard, like I have for the last couple years, you'll find the butterfly keyboard on the 13-inch Pro to be disarmingly flat at first. But while this second-generation layout technically has the same low amount of travel (0.5 mm) as that notebook, the new one offers better tactile feedback, thanks to an improved dome switch design. I typed this entire review on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and found it to be plenty speedy and fairly comfortable. On the 10FastFingers typing test, I averaged between 65 and 70 words per minute with 5 to 6 errors. I did miss some keys at times, forcing me to correct small mistakes. The Force Touch trackpad continues to click without clicking like before, as there's a Taptic Engine that delivers precise haptic feedback. What's different is the size; this touchpad is positively huge at 5.3 x 3.3 inches, which is 46 percent larger than the last 13-inch Pro. And yet the trackpad never registered accidental swipes or clicks as I typed. My only advice is to disable the Force Click function in settings; I found myself inadvertently long pressing on words to look up their meanings when I only wanted to select text. Performance: Good, But 7th Gen Would Be Better While other Windows laptops are opting for Intel's latest and greatest 7th-generation Kaby Lake processor, Apple chose to stick with a 6th-generation Core i5 CPU on the 13-inch MacBook Pro running at 2-GHz. You also get 8GB of RAM, 256GB of flash storage and Intel Iris Graphics 540. The result is a notebook that's faster than the previous Pro but not as speedy as the competition. Even when I had more than a dozen tabs open in Chrome, along with Firefox, Safari and Pixelmator running in the background, the MacBook Pro never stuttered like the Core m-powered 12-inch MacBook that I typically use. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the 13-inch MacBook Pro scored 7,053. That's above the ultraportable category average of 6,618, but below the mark posted by the $1,099 Dell XPS 13 with a 7th-generation Core i5 processor (7,287). Powered by 7th-generation Core i7 chips, the $1,300 HP Spectre x360 (8,147) and $1,200 Lenovo Yoga 910 (8,102) also outpaced the MacBook Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Pro should have no problem crunching numbers, but again it fell behind 7th-gen Core-powered Windows notebooks. It took the Apple notebook 4 minutes and 39 seconds to match 20,000 names and addresses. That beats the 6:24 average but is more than 30 seconds slower than the XPS 13 and a good minute behind the Spectre x360 and Yoga 910. The new MacBook Pro does smoke the competition when it comes to its flash storage. It transfered about 5GB worth of files in just 10 seconds, which translates to 508.9 megabytes per second. Graphics: Iris is Pretty Solid Apple opted for Iris 540 graphics on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is backed by 64MB of eDRAM, which is supposed to accelerate both graphics and processor workloads. It delivered mixed results on our tests. You can certainly game on this notebook, as we saw during a playthrough of the Dirt 3 racing game. At full HD resolution at medium settings, the MacBook Pro notched an average of 35 frames per second, which is perfectly playable. That's higher than the Dell XPS 13's 28 fps at the same settings and the 25 fps category average. However, the Core i7-powered HP Spectre x360 (40 fps) and Yoga 910 (50 fps) both scored higher. On the Cinebench OpenGL graphics rendering test, which simulates a car chase scene, the MacBook Pro achieved a decent 35.69 fps, but both the Dell XPS 13 (42.62 fps) and Spectre x360 (43.8 fps) scored higher. Battery Life: Superb Endurance Apple rates the 54.5 watt-hour battery in the 13-inch MacBook Pro for 10 hours of web surfing time, and that's roughly what it gets in real life. On the Laptop Mag web surfing test, in which we set the screen at 100 nits of brightness and surf the web over Wi-Fi, the MacBook Pro lasted a strong 9 hours and 50 minutes. That beats the ultraportable laptop average of 7:58, but it's less than the 2015 MacBook Pro we reviewed (12:04), as well as the HP Spectre x360 (10:06), Yoga 910 (10:36) and Dell XPS 13. Heat: A Quiet Partner The 13-inch MacBook Pro runs cool in some spots and warm in others, but the fan kept things quiet during our testing. After streaming full-screen video for 15 minutes, the touchpad registered just 85 degrees, which is well below our 95-degree comfort threshold. However, both the keyboard and the bottom of the notebook reached 98 degrees. It was noticeable but not uncomfortable. Software: Siri inside, No bloat One of the benefits of opting for a Mac is that you don't have to worry about unwanted third-party software taking up storage space. It's really all about a pure macOS Sierra experience, which gives you Siri on the Mac for the first time. There's also an Optimized Storage feature that can help free up space when you need it, support for Apple Pay purchases online and an improved Photos app that automatically curates images into ready-made collections called Memories. Configuration Options The entry-level, 13-inch MacBook I reviewed starts at $1,499 and includes a 2-GHz 6th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and a 256GB PCI-e based SSD, plus Intel Iris graphics. Upgrading can get pretty pricey, as jumping up to a Core i7 CPU costs $300. Opting for 16GB of RAM will cost you $200, as will 512GB of flash storage. A 1TB SSD will run you $600. If you would prefer to check out Apple's innovative new Touch Bar, which puts a multitouch screen above the keyboard to give you a wide range of contextually relevant shortcut controls depending on the app you're using, you'll have to pay $1,799. You'll also get a Touch ID button for logging into your Mac and making Apple Pay purchases with a tap of your finger, as well two additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and a faster 2.9-GHz processor. Bottom Line The 13-inch MacBook Pro improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way. It's faster, lighter and more compact, and it offers a brighter display than most Windows machines. I also like the rich and powerful stereo speakers. However, while I'm glad Apple included 2 fast Thunderbolt 3 ports, I wish it kept a traditional USB 3.0 port around for charging the iPhone and connecting other peripherals, as well as an SD card slot. At $1,499, the MacBook Pro also has a higher starting price than most premium Windows ultraportables, and it's $200 more than its predecessor. I'm also not a fan of the decision to opt for an older 6th-generation Intel processor, which means you simply don't get as much performance as systems with 7th-gen CPUs, such as the Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre x360 and Yoga 910. The HP and Lenovo have the added benefit of being 2-in-1s with touchscreens you can use as tablets. So, yes, the new MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop, and I strongly recommend it. But I also wish Apple included the latest Intel processors for the price. Which MacBook Should You Buy?

Up in herrre. :/ Barry Says: November 6th, 2016 at 5:02 pm We ALL need ports and not having the right dongle when getting ready to make a presentation is a deal killer. Further, some have posted videos showing that a dongle can cause WiFi to stop working! This long awaited as in years, upgrade STILL has a max of 16GB memory.....how many years on this limit? a decade? I love thinner but a piece of paper is even thinner just does not do what I need. MBP Retina 13" still is going to be about 80% the performance and zero additional cost. No dongles required. (runs 3 displays! 4k Apple Thunderbolt and built in) Manuel Says: November 3rd, 2016 at 6:50 pm Thanks for your feedback, zeyad morsy. Typically I usually use it for research (i.e. sustained writing and browsing) rather than media-intensive work, so I figured it would be sufficient. My wife does some photo and video editing, though, and I don't see why in 3ish years when the 2012 MBP gives up the ghost, she shouldn't be able to use mine. Maybe I'll just pay extra for RAM and let that be that. zeyad morsy Says: November 2nd, 2016 at 4:52 pm No Manuel, I'm pretty sure that you won't be seeing any performance degradation. In fact, you'll be seeing a huge jump in performance. The new ssd is almost 4 times faster than the 2012 model and the GPU is extremely better. only thing that you'll notice will be the reduction in ram. I suggest upgrading the ram if you think that you'll need it, but if you will be using this laptop for browsing and writings. 8 gigs will be just fine, even more than you'll need for those basic tasks. Mark Spoonauer Says: November 2nd, 2016 at 1:01 pm Thanks for the comments. I do mention Cinebench graphics performance in the review and the MacBook Pro fell flat there as well. I'm open to using other cross-platform graphics benchmarks. But so far I'm not seeing evidence last-generation Iris is better. Seylan Says: November 1st, 2016 at 6:26 pm This should have been priced at $1200, while the touch-bar model should have been $1500. I was really looking forward to these new macbooks, but there's not a lot of value for money here. Henry 3 Dogg Says: November 1st, 2016 at 2:19 pm "I wish it kept a traditional USB 3.0 port around for charging the iPhone" Use a Lightening to USB C cable. David Hellmann Says: November 1st, 2016 at 2:16 pm I think about the new non touch version with 16GB or and used Air 13 2.2 / 8GB / 256GB. The new one without TB looks great but I'm not sure if its the best decision to buy this macbook now when in Q1 maybe an update is coming. I don't know but that feels not 100% right. Maybe if alle the prices are 200 $ cheaper it was more easy to decide. Hmmmmm. p_giguere1 Says: October 31st, 2016 at 7:02 pm I think this review isn't entirely fair. The author mentions several times that the fact it uses a last-generation Intel chip is a con. Yet Intel has not launched any Kaby Lake chip with Iris graphics yet. That's the reason Apple is sticking with Skylake. Basically, Apple had to choose between a significantly better GPU (Skylake with Iris 540) or slightly better CPU (Kaby Lake with HD 620), and they went with there former, which was more expensive and which IMO was the right choice. Yet the author doesn't mention this MBP has much better graphics than the other laptops he compared it to. In fact he claims the opposite. This comes from the fact he isn't measuring actual GPU performance, but rather the gaming performance in a specific game (Dirt 3). That game runs worse not because the GPU in the MBP is worse, but because Mac games are mostly quick ports (cider wraps) with much worse performance under OpenGL than the original Windows game under DirectX. The graphics portion of this review is therefore not really representative of graphics performance outside of gaming. It's also not considering that anybody with a Mac that wants good gaming performance will simply use Boot Camp. So yeah, I would personally not have put the fact it uses Skylake as a con, given that's the reason it has Iris graphics. If anything, it's a pro compared to those other laptops that use Kaby Lake chips with HD 620 graphics. Nathan Says: October 31st, 2016 at 9:58 am I understand that your review unit is the 2.0 GHz one, right? I was considering about buying either the last year's 2.7 GHz i5 or this model. This makes me quite sure that the 2.0 GHz model will do the trick for me. Manuel Says: October 31st, 2016 at 7:43 am Thanks for this in-depth review. I'm considering purchasing this entry-level MBP 2016, but I'm a bit spooked by the the lower 2-GHz i5 processor. Do I understand you correctly to be saying that the performance is nevertheless better than the 2015 MBP, which comes with a 2.7-GHz i5 (5th gen)? I'm attracted this latest update because of portability / screen / battery life, but it just feels weird to pay so much money to leave my mid-2012 (non-retina) 16GB ram / 512GB SSD for a laptop with 8GB ram and 256 SSD. Would I see a reduction in performance? John R Says: October 31st, 2016 at 4:32 am They've gone with Skylake because Kaby Lake isn't due to get Iris graphics until Q1 2017. That's why it's beaten the XPS in the graphics benchmarks. Trevor J Says: October 31st, 2016 at 12:45 am Do you think the battery life is greater than advertised because of the slightly bigger battery in the base model, the lower powered CPU, and the lack of the touchbar? James Pope Says: October 30th, 2016 at 6:06 pm I could care less about the processor being last gen. The newer PC's may have the latest processor but the build quality is crap. Ever single PC I have had dies after just a few years and the Mac's just keep on going. I would opt for a higher quality machine any day, and leave the latest processor (which most people don't need) behind every time.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 1:06PM On Oct. 27, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced three new MacBook Pro computers: a premium 15-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, a premium 13-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, and a 13-inch model without the OLED Touch Bar. Image source: Apple. The systems offer several nice improvements over the prior-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, ranging from improved displays and faster processors to sleeker industrial design. Apple has built a great set of machines here, and I suspect that the new models will do very well in the marketplace. Nevertheless, there is one fly in the proverbial ointment with these new machines that needs to be discussed. Soon-to-be last-generation processors Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models use high-end Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. The 13-inch MacBook Pro systems utilize dual-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors with Intel's premium Iris graphics, while the 15-inch models use quad-core Core i7 processors with lower-end vanilla Intel HD Graphics (though for graphics-intensive tasks, Apple has included more powerful stand-alone graphics chips in these systems). As of this writing, Apple's new MacBook Pros have some of the fastest notebook processors available on the planet. Unfortunately, though, these chips have been available for about a year now, and Intel will have more powerful notebook processors available in early 2017. Why did Apple choose older processors? The reality of the situation is that Apple launches its Mac systems -- particularly the MacBooks -- on its own schedule, rather than based on Intel's schedule. Apple likely wasn't ready to launch these new MacBook Pro systems when Intel's sixth-generation Core processors came out, so it simply had to wait until the system hardware and software were ready. Now, Apple could conceivably have waited until Intel released its new seventh-generation Core processors in January (pushing out the MacBook Pro launch by a couple of months), but the company probably didn't want to hold off on releasing these long-overdue updates to its MacBook Pro line any longer than it had to. Furthermore, the differences between the sixth-generation and seventh-generation Core processors don't amount to that much; the seventh-generation Core chips can run at higher speeds for a given power envelope, and they have slightly enhanced media playback capabilities. Nevertheless, since Apple's MacBook Pro systems are marketed as premium products, it's probably going to come as a disappointment to some that soon they will be using one-generation-old processor technologies. Can Apple's Mac get back up to speed? Apple could conceivably update the processors inside of the new MacBook Pro models to incorporate Intel's newer seventh-generation Core processors early next year. The new processors should be pin-compatible with the current sixth-generation Core processors (meaning that the chips can be placed into the same systems without hardware modification), so upgrading the systems from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core wouldn't be too difficult. Even if Apple doesn't do this, there's a pretty simple way for Apple to get back on track -- skip the seventh-generation Core processors altogether. Intel's eighth-generation Core processors -- which should bring significant performance/feature gains over the seventh-generation Core chips -- should be available for notebooks during the second quarter of 2018, per a recent leak that's been circulating on the Web. Apple could just keep selling the recently released MacBook Pro systems until around May of 2018, at which point the company could release updated versions with Intel's new eighth-generation Core processors: problem solved.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 1:43PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been telling investors for quite a while now that one of the business units that it's counting on for long-term growth is its Internet of Things, or IoT, segment. Although IoT is something of a catch-all term for a wide variety of applications, Intel's IoT business -- per a company presentation last year -- focuses on delivering platforms (that is, processors and other related components) into the areas shown in the following slide: Image source: Intel. Altogether, Intel pegged the served addressable market, or SAM, of these segments at $15 billion to $18 billion -- clearly a sizable opportunity for the chipmaker. Given the long-term revenue potential of this market, it's important for investors to keep an eye on how Intel's IoT business performs, and in the company's most recent quarter, it performed quite well. Double-digit growth for the IoT business in Q3 During the third quarter, the IoT business generated $689 million of revenue, up 18.6% year-over-year. Profitability also improved during that period as operating income jumped from $150 million to $191 million, more than 27% growth. That revenue figure, per Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, represented an "all-time revenue record" for this business unit. The executive cited "strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments" for the strong result. Year-to-date, the IoT business has brought in $1.912 billion in revenue for Intel, representing about 14.3% growth over the year-ago period. Operating profit, on the other hand, is up just 5.4%, potentially reflecting the fact that the company has ratcheted up its investments in new products and technologies for this business. Intel is investing more in the IoT Intel Executive VP and former CFO Stacy Smith pointed out on the earnings call that Intel's restructuring program announced earlier this year is allowing the company to make "incremental investments in critical areas like the data center, Internet of Things, and memory." So far, the company has done a good job of capturing a significant portion of the SAM available to it in this market. If we assume that Intel's IoT business closes out the year delivering around 14% revenue growth (approximately $2.62 billion total), then the company will have captured anywhere from 14.5% to 17.5% of its served addressable market. That's a solid market share, but Intel is likely betting that with a more compelling, targeted set of products for the clients that it serves, it will be able grow its share of the overall market. Those "incremental investments" that Smith talked about are likely aimed at allowing Intel to do just that. Intel's automotive-specific chip, known as the Atom A3900. Image source: Intel. In fact, we are beginning to see the first fruits of Intel's increased investments in the Internet of Things. Just this week, AnandTech posted some information about a recently launched set of processors from Intel aimed specifically at IoT applications. Indeed, while Intel has been selling IoT-specific products into these applications, they have usually been based on the same exact silicon as chips used in other segments (PCs, tablets, and so on). In the case of the new Atom E3900 and A3900 chips, Intel has reportedly designed specialized system-on-chip products that incorporate much of the fundamental technologies used in other products (CPU cores, graphics) as well as IoT-specific technologies (you can read more about them on AnandTech). Time will tell if these investments in IoT-specific chips will pay off, but the odds -- especially considering the success that Intel has enjoyed in this market thus far -- look good.

Is the chipmaking giant about to stomp on Ambarella’s toes? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:00PM Last month, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) purchased computer vision start-up Movidius in a bid to beef up its RealSense depth-sensing cameras with AI capabilities. In late October, Movidius inked a major deal with Hikvision, the world's biggest surveillance company, to install its low-power Myriad 2 VPUs (visual processing units) into its security cameras. A Myriad 2 reference board (L) and a Hikvision camera (R). Image source: Company websites. The new chips will help Hikvision's new cameras analyze activity in real-time using artificial intelligence. Hikvision CEO Hu Yangzhong declared that there were huge "gains to be made when it comes to neural networks and intelligent camera systems." He also noted that "embedded, native intelligence is a major step toward smart, safe, and efficiently run cities." Hikvision controls about 30% of the global market for security cameras. It's also one of chipmaker Ambarella's (NASDAQ:AMBA) biggest customers. So as Intel and Movidius seal a major deal with Hikvision, should Ambarella investors worry about the company eventually losing a top customer? What computer vision means to Intel Over the past few years, Intel's primary goal has been to diversify away from its slow-growth PC and data center businesses with new investments in Internet of Things (IoT) modules, non-volatile memory, and new technologies like depth-sensing cameras with built-in artificial intelligence. In the drone market, Intel partnered with AT&T (NYSE:T) to test automated drone flights across AT&T's LTE network, and combined its Atom chips with RealSense cameras to create a reference design for drone makers. In the VR and AR markets, Intel introduced Project Alloy, a "mixed reality" headset which is powered by Intel's sixth generation Core processor and RealSense depth-sensing cameras. The device, which is similar to Microsoft's HoloLens, projects computer images on top of real-life objects. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. In the connected car market, Intel acquired smaller companies like the computer vision start-up Itseez and Yogitech, a company that ensures that the chips powering driverless vehicles are operating properly. It also partnered with BMW and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) to develop new technologies for self-driving cars. Therefore, Intel's expansion into the security camera market is another adjacent move which complements those other efforts. How could this hurt Ambarella? Movidius and Ambarella aren't really direct competitors. Movidius generally produces lower-powered VPUs for IoT devices, while Ambarella produces higher-powered image processing chips that process high-detail images. Therefore, the two chips generally work in tandem in many devices, like DJI's Phantom 4 drone. Ambarella's chips process the images and video captured by the sensor, but Movidius' VPUs allow the Phantom 4 to fly autonomously and avoid obstacles. The chips also work together in security cameras -- Ambarella's SoCs process the details, while Movidius' VPUs analyze the movements. But looking ahead, Intel would likely benefit from producing "all-in-one" reference designs that use its Core CPUs for image processing, its RealSense cameras for "seeing", and its Movidius VPUs for analyzing the viewed objects. That bundle could lock Ambarella out of the lucrative computer vision market. Ambarella is clearly aware of that threat -- that's why it acquired the computer vision firm VisLab last year for $30 million. It also plans to launch a dedicated computer vision chip by the end of this year. If Ambarella plays its cards right, it can leverage its reputation as the "best in breed" manufacturer of image processing SoCs to secure its spot in the budding computer vision market. But if it waits too long, major customers like Hikvision and DJI could be lured away by Intel's all-in-one solutions. The key takeaways Movidius and Ambarella's technologies currently complement each other, but this could change next year as Intel expands more aggressively into the computer vision market. Another major threat is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has been aggressively courting major Ambarella customers like DJI and GoPro with its Snapdragon-powered computer vision platforms.  The next few years could be tough for Ambarella as it tries to hold those larger rivals at bay with new image processing and computer vision chipsets. But they could also be fruitful if Ambarella maintains its lead as the "best in breed" chipmaker in image processing and computer vision solutions.   Leo Sun owns shares of AT&T and Qualcomm.

Following her visit, Dunn brought further awareness to the Intel She Will Connect app at a hands-on-session where leading NGO and media personnel could learn ways to adopt the tool to reach more girls, especially in rural areas, to educate them on digital literacy. Marne Dunn is known for her strong passion to close the gender digital divide, and she continues to inspire people to lifelong learning. She currently leads the Intel She Will Connect Program which is a Corporate Affairs initiative of Intel aimed at closing the gender digital divide and enabling women through technology. With a goal to lead her team over the next 3 years to reach 5 Million women and to create lasting change in communities by enabling 10,000 women by the end of 2020, Marne and her team will leverage the Intel She Will Connect App. As part of this drive, Marne’s recent visit to Lagos, Nigeria was dedicated to the Intel® She Will Connect app which is a highly useful tool that connects more women and girls with the internet. These participants learn to use mobile devices and PCs to empower themselves, while remaining safe. Girls can learn to use technology to access the Internet, set up email accounts, research health and wellness topics, practice Internet safety on social media platforms like Facebook, while also getting inspirational stories of women who have benefited greatly by connecting to the internet. Using the Intel She Will Connect App The She Will Connect App is a simple easy to use app that comes with four categories: Inspire, Learn, Connect and Explore. Inspire: To help users to understand why they should use the internet, and also share inspiring stories of women using the internet. Learn: To help users learn how to computer and mobile device basics, as well as using a keyboard, using touch features, connecting to Wi-Fi, understanding Data Usage and Cost, protecting your devices. Connect: To help users learn how to create an account, send email, use Social Media, like creating a facebook account, sharing information, and downloading content, like Mobile Apps. Explore: It opens users to the endless possibility available on the internet. The device helps users to learn to explore the internet for information like learning how to start a business, Finding access to education, health and info, as well as reading local and global news, and also read about the inspiring lives of many women on My Digital Journey. Challenges of bridging the technological divide in Nigeria. A report from the ITU World Telecommunication/ICT indicator database states that globally, there are more men than women using the internet. We have 37% of women online compared to 41% of men across the globe. This means 1.3billion women and 1.5billion men. In the developing world, which includes Nigeria, this means about 826million female internet users and 483 million male internet users. In essence, the gender divide is more prominent in the developing countries, where 16% less women than men use the internet. While there are several challenges that women and girls face in bridging the gender gaps in technology, most prevalent ones include education, infrastructure, skills, financial resources, and power and decision making. The internet can open up opportunities and close some of these gaps—there are increasing online courses on the internet for women who want to educate themselves to acquire new skills, learn how to start a business, access funding organisations or even learn the basics of decision making in business. With a population of 162.5 million people in Nigeria, with 49% female, access and control of the technology in relations to opportunities is a challenge. Benefits of the apps The number of women without access to internet access is slowly being bridged by efforts like the Intel She Will Connect App. Currently, the Intel® She Will Connect Program has successfully connected over 40,000 females to the internet, and the Awareness app will open even more possibility for more girls to become digitally literate The app will offer women and girls the opportunity to be empowered, enjoy access to health and educational information, and benefit from capacity building. With the app, more women and girls can enhance their social and economic knowledge, and in the long run this would empower, increase productivity and in the long run reduce poverty.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 11:42AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has bet its future on its data-center group, or DCG. In 2016, this business unit is expected to rake in around $17 billion in revenue and a little under half that in operating income. Though not quite as large as the company's Client Computing Group, or CCG, in terms of either revenue or profit, it -- unlike CCG -- is exposed to a number of growing markets rather than mostly declining ones.  Intel Xeon E5 v2 processors. Image source: Intel.   This makes DCG Intel's best hope at being able to deliver consistent revenue growth. And that's why investors get a bit freaked out when this segment fails to deliver the kind of growth the both management and investors expect -- if the DCG party slows, Intel's longer-term prospects begin to look much dimmer.  Crucial to keeping the growth story going, particularly over the next couple of years, will be Intel's ability to build products compelling enough to keep the many chip companies looking to eat into its near-total dominance of the server processor market. That's why it was interesting to hear that Intel's next-generation server processor platform, known as Purley -- and referred to in leaked Intel slides as a platform that "changes the game" -- has begun sampling to major customers. What is Intel Purley? Purley is Intel's next-generation server processor platform, succeeding the company's prior-generation Grantley platform. The new platform is expected to deliver a bevy of new features, including enhanced connectivity, the ability for the processors to transfer data to and from memory at a much faster rate, and other features. More importantly, though, new platforms bring support for new processors. Under Intel's current product-development methodology, the introduction of a new platform also means the release of processors based on an all-new architecture, or design, relative to the prior-generation platform. These platforms do need to last anywhere from two to three years, depending on Intel's ability to roll out new platforms and associated processors, so Intel will usually release a follow-on set of processors that work with the same platform. The second-generation of processors on an Intel platform generally use mildly enhanced versions of the all-new processor architecture that comes with the introduction of the platform. The good news, though, is that this second wave of products is manufactured on newer manufacturing technologies that allow the company to cram many more processor cores into a given power envelope, thereby delivering significantly enhanced performance. What does Purley mean for investors? If Intel is sampling Purley to customers now, then the platform should begin volume shipments during the first half of 2017, if all goes as planned. Interestingly, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated on the company's most recent earnings call that Intel isn't seeing evidence that major customers are holding off buying today's Grantley platform to wait for Purley and Skylake-EP. If Krzanich is right about that, then investors may not want to bet on seeing Purley catalyze additional growth. Instead, the success of the Purley platform in that case will largely depend on the health of the data-center markets that Intel serves, as well as its ability to use Purley to defend against competitors. Nevertheless, Krzanich did talk about some of the non-CPU technologies that Intel will offer alongside Purley that it doesn't include with its Grantley platform today: "[Customers are] seeing not only just an overall [total cost of ownership] performance advantage that we see with each one of these [new server processor launches], but this also continues [Intel's] integration of things like the omni-path fabric; it has more integration of the silicon photonics, so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong; and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint." In other words, in addition to aiming to deliver the right performance and power efficiency to help fend off competitors, Intel is betting on Purley to be the way it encourages customers to buy more "non-CPU" products such as omni-path fabric, silicon photonics, and 3D XPoint memory modules. At its investor meeting in late 2015, Intel said the total addressable markets for these three technologies would be $1.6 billion, $5 billion, and $34 billion by 2020, respectively. Although Intel's data-center group revenues will ultimately live and die by the end demand for its server platforms, capturing share in these adjacent market opportunities would certainly be welcome revenue to the company and its investors.

Is the chipmaking giant about to stomp on Ambarella’s toes? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:00PM Last month, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) purchased computer vision start-up Movidius in a bid to beef up its RealSense depth-sensing cameras with AI capabilities. In late October, Movidius inked a major deal with Hikvision, the world's biggest surveillance company, to install its low-power Myriad 2 VPUs (visual processing units) into its security cameras. A Myriad 2 reference board (L) and a Hikvision camera (R). Image source: Company websites. The new chips will help Hikvision's new cameras analyze activity in real-time using artificial intelligence. Hikvision CEO Hu Yangzhong declared that there were huge "gains to be made when it comes to neural networks and intelligent camera systems." He also noted that "embedded, native intelligence is a major step toward smart, safe, and efficiently run cities." Hikvision controls about 30% of the global market for security cameras. It's also one of chipmaker Ambarella's (NASDAQ:AMBA) biggest customers. So as Intel and Movidius seal a major deal with Hikvision, should Ambarella investors worry about the company eventually losing a top customer? What computer vision means to Intel Over the past few years, Intel's primary goal has been to diversify away from its slow-growth PC and data center businesses with new investments in Internet of Things (IoT) modules, non-volatile memory, and new technologies like depth-sensing cameras with built-in artificial intelligence. In the drone market, Intel partnered with AT&T (NYSE:T) to test automated drone flights across AT&T's LTE network, and combined its Atom chips with RealSense cameras to create a reference design for drone makers. In the VR and AR markets, Intel introduced Project Alloy, a "mixed reality" headset which is powered by Intel's sixth generation Core processor and RealSense depth-sensing cameras. The device, which is similar to Microsoft's HoloLens, projects computer images on top of real-life objects. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. In the connected car market, Intel acquired smaller companies like the computer vision start-up Itseez and Yogitech, a company that ensures that the chips powering driverless vehicles are operating properly. It also partnered with BMW and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) to develop new technologies for self-driving cars. Therefore, Intel's expansion into the security camera market is another adjacent move which complements those other efforts. How could this hurt Ambarella? Movidius and Ambarella aren't really direct competitors. Movidius generally produces lower-powered VPUs for IoT devices, while Ambarella produces higher-powered image processing chips that process high-detail images. Therefore, the two chips generally work in tandem in many devices, like DJI's Phantom 4 drone. Ambarella's chips process the images and video captured by the sensor, but Movidius' VPUs allow the Phantom 4 to fly autonomously and avoid obstacles. The chips also work together in security cameras -- Ambarella's SoCs process the details, while Movidius' VPUs analyze the movements. But looking ahead, Intel would likely benefit from producing "all-in-one" reference designs that use its Core CPUs for image processing, its RealSense cameras for "seeing", and its Movidius VPUs for analyzing the viewed objects. That bundle could lock Ambarella out of the lucrative computer vision market. Ambarella is clearly aware of that threat -- that's why it acquired the computer vision firm VisLab last year for $30 million. It also plans to launch a dedicated computer vision chip by the end of this year. If Ambarella plays its cards right, it can leverage its reputation as the "best in breed" manufacturer of image processing SoCs to secure its spot in the budding computer vision market. But if it waits too long, major customers like Hikvision and DJI could be lured away by Intel's all-in-one solutions. The key takeaways Movidius and Ambarella's technologies currently complement each other, but this could change next year as Intel expands more aggressively into the computer vision market. Another major threat is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has been aggressively courting major Ambarella customers like DJI and GoPro with its Snapdragon-powered computer vision platforms.  The next few years could be tough for Ambarella as it tries to hold those larger rivals at bay with new image processing and computer vision chipsets. But they could also be fruitful if Ambarella maintains its lead as the "best in breed" chipmaker in image processing and computer vision solutions.   Leo Sun owns shares of AT&T and Qualcomm.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 11:42AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has bet its future on its data-center group, or DCG. In 2016, this business unit is expected to rake in around $17 billion in revenue and a little under half that in operating income. Though not quite as large as the company's Client Computing Group, or CCG, in terms of either revenue or profit, it -- unlike CCG -- is exposed to a number of growing markets rather than mostly declining ones.  Intel Xeon E5 v2 processors. Image source: Intel.   This makes DCG Intel's best hope at being able to deliver consistent revenue growth. And that's why investors get a bit freaked out when this segment fails to deliver the kind of growth the both management and investors expect -- if the DCG party slows, Intel's longer-term prospects begin to look much dimmer.  Crucial to keeping the growth story going, particularly over the next couple of years, will be Intel's ability to build products compelling enough to keep the many chip companies looking to eat into its near-total dominance of the server processor market. That's why it was interesting to hear that Intel's next-generation server processor platform, known as Purley -- and referred to in leaked Intel slides as a platform that "changes the game" -- has begun sampling to major customers. What is Intel Purley? Purley is Intel's next-generation server processor platform, succeeding the company's prior-generation Grantley platform. The new platform is expected to deliver a bevy of new features, including enhanced connectivity, the ability for the processors to transfer data to and from memory at a much faster rate, and other features. More importantly, though, new platforms bring support for new processors. Under Intel's current product-development methodology, the introduction of a new platform also means the release of processors based on an all-new architecture, or design, relative to the prior-generation platform. These platforms do need to last anywhere from two to three years, depending on Intel's ability to roll out new platforms and associated processors, so Intel will usually release a follow-on set of processors that work with the same platform. The second-generation of processors on an Intel platform generally use mildly enhanced versions of the all-new processor architecture that comes with the introduction of the platform. The good news, though, is that this second wave of products is manufactured on newer manufacturing technologies that allow the company to cram many more processor cores into a given power envelope, thereby delivering significantly enhanced performance. What does Purley mean for investors? If Intel is sampling Purley to customers now, then the platform should begin volume shipments during the first half of 2017, if all goes as planned. Interestingly, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated on the company's most recent earnings call that Intel isn't seeing evidence that major customers are holding off buying today's Grantley platform to wait for Purley and Skylake-EP. If Krzanich is right about that, then investors may not want to bet on seeing Purley catalyze additional growth. Instead, the success of the Purley platform in that case will largely depend on the health of the data-center markets that Intel serves, as well as its ability to use Purley to defend against competitors. Nevertheless, Krzanich did talk about some of the non-CPU technologies that Intel will offer alongside Purley that it doesn't include with its Grantley platform today: "[Customers are] seeing not only just an overall [total cost of ownership] performance advantage that we see with each one of these [new server processor launches], but this also continues [Intel's] integration of things like the omni-path fabric; it has more integration of the silicon photonics, so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong; and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these.

But is the added price worth the upgrade?  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple recently unveiled new MacBook Pro models after a long time of not giving enough attention to the MacBook Pro. One of the biggest features in the new 13-inch and 15-inch models is Apple's Touch Bar, a secondary OLED multi-touch panel that changes interfaces depending on the app currently used. Also on board the new MacBook are sixth-generation Skylake processors and Touch ID. Apart from the aforementioned features, there's not much to say about the new MacBook Pro models, aside from having extra power and losing some of the ports from before. This begs the question, is it really worth the upgrade? What's New? The base 13-inch model MacBook Pro doesn't come with the Touch Bar or the Touch ID, but it does come with a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an SSD with 256 GB. It has 8 GB of RAM that can be configured to 16 GB, and it sports an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. Another 13-inch model with the Touch Bar is available for an extra cost, which comes with a more powerful 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Iris Graphics 550 GPU. The 15-inch model comes with the Touch Bar as a standard feature, and the most expensive model has a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, an SSD with 512 GB, integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 and a beefed-up Radeon Pro 455 for its GPU with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. The new butterfly-style keyboard and Force Touch trackpad are also present in the new MacBook Pro models. Beyond that, the changes aren't huge. It's the same Retina display that came with the MacBook Pro in 2015, only 67 percent brighter. Aside from slight cosmetic changes and a considerably thinner chassis, the new MacBook Pro models don more powerful processors, with the higher end 13-inch and the 15-inch model coming with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Overall, it's not a colossal departure from last year's models. Are The New Features Worth The Added Cost? Despite the sizable possibilities with the new Touch Bar, it's safe to say that there was never a demand for the feature in the first place. In fact, what users actually wanted more from an Apple laptop was a touchscreen. There's no telling what developers can come up with Touch Bar, but for something largely unexplored, the Touch Bar seems like a nice add-on instead of a compelling selling point. Consumers aren't likely ready to break bank on the newer models just for the Touch Bar alone. If anything, maybe they'd put more consideration into the sixth-generation processors on these models as a defining factor. For now, the Touch Bar and Touch ID are nice bonuses for the more powerful MacBook Pro models, but it's an exaggeration to call it something revolutionary since the MacBooks are perfectly functional even without them. Should You Upgrade? One of the best deciding factors to arrive at a conclusion is to ask yourself what exactly will you use the MacBook for. Will you use it as an all-around laptop that can do basic functions such as web browsing, word processing, intermediate photo or video editing? Or are you intending to use graphics-intensive software as part of your profession? Apple is targeting filmmakers, editors, designers and creative professionals in trying to sell the Touch Bar as a necessary innovation in the way we interact with software. So if you're not part of that demographic, it's highly unlikely that you'll find the Touch Bar a compelling feature to have to justify the added cost. If you're itching for a MacBook Pro but you aren't that enthusiastic about the added bells and whistles of the newer models, then last year's MacBook would serve you just fine. In fact, those who are planning to get the new MacBook pro models are in for some hefty dongle purchases since they only come with two to four USB-C ports compared with last year's model that carried an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SD card reader and two USB 3.0 ports. In conclusion, if you're willing to shell out the added cost and upgrade, then do as you please. But if you're a bit skeptical, it's probably best to trust your gut. A comprehensive comparison of last year's MacBook Pro models should equip you sufficiently and let you know exactly what you're getting if your eyes are set on the older MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2015 model starts at $1,299, while the newer base model sans the Touch Bar starts at $1,499. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2015 model costs $1,999, while the newer 15-inch model costs $2,399. You can compare different models directly at Apple's website.

Oct 31st 2016, 9:30 PM 9,691 Views 5 Comments Share17 Tweet Email1 Image: Movidius THE HEAD OF Movidius, one of the country’s most prominent tech companies, has said that the company’s Dublin base could become the centre of the artificial intelligence industry in Ireland. Remi El-Ouazzane, the company’s chief executive, also said that the firm has plans to significantly ramp up its operations and hopes to hit $1 billion in sales by 2021. Based in Dublin, Movidius designs computer chips which handle advanced vision-processing duties in computers and devices such as cameras and drones. The firm was recently acquired by US computer giant Intel in a deal thought to be worth at least €300 million, making it one of the largest sales involving an indigenous Irish company so far this year. El-Ouazzane, who is speaking at the Drones, Data X conference in Dublin next week, said that the firm is now planning to dramatically expand with Intel’s support. “The goal I have is for the company, by 2021, to hit $1 billion revenue,” he said. It is not ludicrous because you need to think of the company as diversified. He said that the company’s revenue is divided into relatively even thirds, with sales from the drone, security camera and ‘augmented reality’ industries. Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane Source: Youtube Drones Crucially, the Irish firm has a partnership with Dajiang Innovation (DJI), a Hong-Kong based firm which was estimated to account for 70% of the commercial drone market last year. Movidius’ Myriad 2 chip, which is being used in the company’s drones, gives unmanned aircrafts human-like sight capabilities. DJI has developed specialized software algorithms and 3D ‘depth sensing’. These algorithms, coupled with the Movidius’ chip, gives DJI’s drones the ability to sense and avoid obstacles in real-time. This means that the drones can make more autonomous flight functions, and gives them an improved awareness of space while in the air, allowing them to adjust their flight and avoid obstacles in real-time by themselves. DJI had sales of about $1 billion last year. Movidius’ technology debuted in DJI’s flagship Phantom 4 aircraft in March and also powers its new Mavic line, which has received positive reviews. As long as demand for DJI’s drones hold up, Movidius should also see good demand for its chips. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=hX0UELNRR1I&t=) Source: Movidius/YouTube “The (drone) market is growing quite fast, and when you combine that with the machine vision on our devices, the drone market is sizable,” El-Ouazzane said. He declined to say how long Movidius’ agreement with DJI is set to run for, although he said that it is a “solid partnership”. He also confirmed that the Irish company is looking for other drone companies to partner with, but declined to give more detail. Security Earlier this week Movidius also announced a deal to partner with another Chinese company, Hikvision, which is the world’s largest supplier of CCTV and video surveillance equipment. Movidius’ Myriad 2 will be powering a new line of the Zhejiang-based company’s smart cameras. El-Ouazzane said that this agreement will likely be as significant for Movidius as its agreement with DJI. Movidius was founded by David Moloney and Sean Mitchell Source: Maxwell Photography “Hikvision is to security cameras what DJI is to the drone market, they have a very strong presence,” he said. Work on Movidius’ technology hasn’t come cheap. The firm made a loss of $19.5 million (€18 million) last year, bringing accumulated loss to $82.6 million as it focused on research and development. Dublin expansion El-Ouazzane declined to reveal a break even aim for the company, but said that its recent agreements will spur a huge growth in sales. “In 2014 our revenue was roughly $1 million, in 2015 it was in excess of $10 million,” he said. This year, if we are not constrained by supply issues, you can expect revenue to grow by 200%. “We need to expand from Dublin as we are growing the number of products we are building.

The EUV light needed to expose wafers is created near the bottom of the scanner, on the side visible in the foreground of this photograph. The far end of the machine is attached to a “track” that coats the wafers before exposure and processes them once they are done. Even after you don a bunny suit and get deep inside Fab 8, it’s hard to get a sense of scale. Rows upon rows of tall machines, known as tools, dominate this US $12 billion GlobalFoundries facility, built amid forest north of Albany, N.Y. Carriers containing silicon wafers zip overhead along ceiling-mounted tracks, like tiny inverted roller coasters. If your timing is good, you’ll be standing by a tool when one of those carriers descends to join it, moving a wafer along to the next step in the three-month-long process it takes to turn a dinner-plate-size disk of raw silicon into chips that could be used inside smartphones, personal computers, and servers. That’s right: Begin making a microprocessor here on New Year’s Day and it may just be finished by the start of spring. Photos: ASML Inside the Machine: To generate EUV, pulses of CO2 laser light are sent into a vessel [top and middle] where they collide with tiny tin droplets to create plasma. This partially assembled EUV scanner [bottom] at ASML’s headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, is one of the company’s more recent models. More than 60 times in the course of this advanced manufacturing process, a wafer will be coated with a light-sensitive substance and enter a light-tight box called a scanner. There, in a process called photolithography, laser light shines through a patterned surface and casts shrunken versions of that pattern onto the wafer, creating the ultrafine features that are needed to build the minute transistors and wiring inside cutting-edge processors. There is little to distinguish these lithography machines from the myriad other tools in this vast ocean of automation. There is no big red sign that flashes “Critically important step here!” But lithography, explains Fab 8 general manager Tom Caulfield, “is the heartbeat of the fab.” Think of these scanners as the front line of Moore’s Law, the repeated doubling of the density of integrated circuit components that has defined more than 50 years of astounding technological progress. For decades, a steady series of remarkable breakthroughs, many of them in photolithography, have enabled chipmakers to repeatedly shrink chip features, keep the length of R&D cycles under control, and economically pack more and more transistors on a chip. Those advances have taken us from chips with thousands of transistors in the early 1970s to billions today. But to keep the good times rolling, GlobalFoundries and other leading-edge chipmakers won’t be able to rely on the brilliant lithographic advances of the past. And so they’re contemplating another radical shift, one that could prove to be the most challenging yet. For the entirety of its existence, semiconductor lithography has been done with electromagnetic radiation that was more or less recognizable as light. But for the change chipmakers are now weighing, the radiation is something else altogether. It’s called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, but don’t let that name fool you. Unlike the ultraviolet light used in today’s scanners, EUV can’t travel in air, and it can’t be focused by lenses or conventional mirrors. And it’s also difficult to produce; the process begins by firing laser light at a rapid-fire stream of tiny molten tin droplets. The hope is that scanners built to use the resulting 13.5-nanometer light—a wavelength that is less than a tenth of what is used in today’s most state-of-the-art machines—will save chipmakers money by allowing them to print in a single step layers that would otherwise require multiple exposures.   Photo: ASML Inside the Scanner: To make patterns with EUV, engineers had to leave lenses behind. A series of mirrors brings EUV radiation from the scanner’s light source [bottom right] to a mask, which carries the patterns to be printed, and then on to the wafer. An attached “track” [left side, not shown] brings wafers in and out of the scanner. The masks have a separate entrance. But creating EUV systems that are bright and reliable enough to operate in the fab—nearly 24 hours a day, 365 days a year—has proved to be a monumental engineering challenge. For many years, EUV faced significant skepticism and repeatedly failed to live up to predictions that it was almost ready for prime time. Now, though, the technology really does seem to be turning a corner. The brightness of the EUV light source made by Dutch lithography-tool manufacturer ASML Holding seems to be closing in on a figure long targeted for commercial production. ASML, which has emerged as the technology’s standard-bearer, is now shipping EUV scanners that it says should be ready to mass manufacture leading-edge microprocessors and memory starting in 2018. The world’s most advanced chipmakers are working hard to determine when and how these machines will be incorporated into their production lines. The stakes are high. Moore’s Law is facing significant challenges, and no one is sure how the semiconductor industry—which grossed more than $330 billion last year—will navigate the next five or 10 years or what a post-Moore’s-Law semiconductor industry will look like. A decline in revenues might be inevitable. But if keeping the “law” in effect avoids, say, a 15 percent drop in the industry’s income, that would keep an amount of money flowing that is twice as great as the total revenues of the U.S. video game industry. The fineness of the details that can be made with a photolithographic system depends on several factors. But a powerful way to make dramatic improvements is to shorten the wavelength of the light it uses. For decades, lithographers have done just that, shifting their wafer-exposing tools from operation at the blue edge of what’s visible to the human eye down to successively shorter wavelengths in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Images: ASML Curves and Corners: EUV promises to create sharper shapes [right] than those that can be created through multiple patterning with today’s 193-nanometer light [left]. The lines in these micrographs have a minimum width of 24 nm. In the late 1980s, the semiconductor industry was beginning the process [PDF] of shifting from mercury lamps to lasers as the light source of choice, reducing the wavelength from 365 nm to 248 nm in the process. But some researchers were already contemplating a far bigger jump, into the X-ray range. Hiroo Kinoshita, then at the Japanese telecommunications firm NTT, reported the results of early work on this idea way back in 1986, using 11-nm radiation. Others, at AT&T Bell Laboratories and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also explored the technology independently. In 1989, some of these researchers met and traded notes at a lithography conference. In ensuing years, research into the notion got infusions of investment from government and industry. ASML and several partners began work on what was by then known as EUV lithography in the late 1990s. That was when Anton van Dijsseldonk, who grew up in Veldhoven, the Dutch town where ASML is headquartered, became the company’s first full-time employee on the project. “The end of Moore’s Law was predicted,” he recalls, and the semiconductor industry was hunting for ways to keep resolution improvements going. Chipmakers were also struggling to improve overlay—the ability to put a wafer back in the scanner again after its peregrinations through the fab and have the next set of patterns print in exactly the right place. “People were looking in those days at the alternatives,” van Dijsseldonk says, “and EUV was the exotic one.” But from the beginning, ASML’s EUV researchers were convinced they could make the technology work—and that it would be the most economical option for chipmakers. Before the decade was out, the company had decided to build demonstration scanners that could be used by other researchers to test the approach. Nothing about it was easy. Physics offers few favors for engineers hoping to cast patterns with what are essentially X-rays. At 13.5 nm, the wavelength the company ultimately chose, light is readily absorbed by many materials. Even the air we breathe “is absolutely black,” absorbing every last bit of the radiation, van Dijsseldonk notes. So he and his colleagues realized early on that the only way an EUV scanner could work was in vacuum, with each wafer entering and leaving the scanner through an air lock. And then there’s the problem of bending the radiation. EUV is also absorbed by glass, so directing it through the machine would require a shift from lenses to mirrors. And not just any mirrors. A simple polished surface would not be nearly reflective enough, so they’d have to use Bragg reflectors—multilayer mirrors that can constructively reinforce many small reflections into a single, reasonably strong one. Photos: ASML Headed East: A portion of an ASML NXE:3350B EUV scanner is loaded onto a 747-400 extended-range freighter at the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, for shipment to a customer. The scanner is split into nine parts (some larger than others) for shipping. Today, the mirrors inside ASML’s EUV machines consist of 40 pairs of alternating silicon and molybdenum layers—each just a few nanometers thick. Zeiss, the company that developed these mirrors, constructs their aspheric surfaces with great precision. But at the end of the day, van Dijsseldonk says, “if you do it fantastically [well], you get a mirror with a reflectivity of 70 percent.” That level of reflectivity means that, for every pair of mirrors used in the system, the light is cut by half. And a scanner could easily require a dozen mirrors to take light from the source to the mask—itself a mirror—and then on to the wafer. After an EUV beam has traversed this gauntlet, less than 2 percent of the light may be left. The less light that reaches a wafer, the longer a wafer must remain in the scanner to be exposed. And in a fab, time means money. For EUV to make it into commercial use, it needs to be able to compete with the cost of existing lithographic methods. So the losses among the mirrors have to be compensated by a radiation source that is extremely bright. And that proved to be really, really hard to engineer. In the early days, EUV researchers used just about everything they could think of to generate X-rays, including lasers and particle accelerators. But the method that won out, which seemed to offer a practical and economical way to get sufficient brightness, employs plasma. Zap the right material with a powerful enough laser or electric current and you can separate electrons from the atoms they’re attached to. The resulting plasma will radiate EUV as the superhot blob cools back to its prezapped state. The oft-repeated target for such plasma-based light sources has been 250 watts at the intermediate focus, the location where the EUV light exits the source and enters the scanner. That level of light would enable the machine to produce in the neighborhood of 125 wafers per hour, a mass production target that is about half the rate of today’s advanced 193-nm machines. But for a number of years, progress was slow, and brightness improvements consistently lagged behind predictions. By 2011, some five years after ASML delivered its first test scanners to two customers, one of the leading light-source developers, San Diego–based Cymer, had succeeded in developing a source that could consistently deliver 11 W. “We probably underestimated how difficult it would be,” concedes ASML’s Hans Meiling, who is responsible for EUV product marketing. In the end, in an effort to accelerate development, ASML put in a bid for Cymer, formally completing the reported €3.1 billion acquisition in 2013. To create EUV light, Cymer uses an approach called laser-produced plasma, which fires 50,000 microscopic droplets a second of ultrapure molten tin across a vacuum chamber, hitting each with powerful CO2-laser light generated by a series of amplifiers derived from a design originally used for metal cutting. When a laser pulse hits a molten tin droplet, it heats it up into an EUV-emitting plasma. A collector mirror reflects light created in this process and casts it into the scanner. Because the approach generates EUV light as well as tin debris, hydrogen gas constantly flows across the collector mirror to keep it from being rapidly covered with a layer of tin. “The first time I heard about it, I thought it was insane,” admits ASML’s Alberto Pirati, who joined the company’s EUV light-source program in early 2013. But little by little, the team achieved the seemingly impossible. One of the biggest breakthroughs came with the introduction of a technique the Cymer team began exploring before being acquired by ASML. They found that if they fired a “prepulse” before the main laser, they could flatten each tin droplet into a pancake, creating more surface area for the main laser to hit and increasing how much of the tin droplet was converted to plasma. The change has boosted the laser-to-EUV conversion efficiency from a meager 1 percent to some 5 percent. Earlier this year, thanks to the prepulse and other optimizations, ASML reported that it had reached 200 W in the lab. Another light-source developer, Gigaphoton, has also reported great progress. The long-awaited production target of 250 W no longer seems far off. But the true test of whether EUV is ready to go into production will happen in the labs and fabs—and spreadsheets—of ASML’s chipmaking customers. Nobody doubts that EUV machines can make fine features. Go to a semiconductor conference and you’ll probably come across a presentation with sharp-looking micrographs of EUV-made patterns, juxtaposed against blurrier ones made using today’s conventional methods. The question now is what role EUV will play in the mass production of major commercial chips—and when it will do it. Certainly, the cost of adopting EUV seems daunting. The list price of ASML’s newest EUV machine exceeds €100 million, more than twice that of an average 193-nm scanner, says spokesperson Niclas Mika. It is about the height and width of a New York City bus and is shipped in multiple 747s. Customer estimates suggest such a machine, run at mass-production levels, could consume some 1.5 megawatts or so of electricity, significantly more than a 193-nm machine. Images: ASML The Evolution of a Droplet: To create EUV light, molten tin droplets are flattened by one laser pulse and then converted to light-emitting plasma by a second pulse. But a simple comparison of specs won’t capture all the costs of manufacturing. Today’s state-of-the-art 193-nm lithographic systems can produce chip features with dimensions that are a small fraction of that wavelength. This feat was made possible by two major breakthroughs. The first was immersion lithography, which places water between a silicon wafer and the optics that project a pattern onto it. The second was multiple patterning, which splits the process of making the features in a layer into two or more steps. To create a set of closely spaced holes, for example, a wafer can be run once through the scanner to fashion half of them, and then again to fashion the other half, slightly offset. Because wafer position can be determined with great precision, multiple patterning lets engineers create features that are more closely spaced than would be possible in one step. In principle, the more steps used, the finer the features. But each addition makes the process of bringing a chip into the world costlier and more complex. Today, GlobalFoundries uses triple patterning when it makes its 14-nm chips, the most advanced ones currently created in Fab 8. This means that, for certain critical layers, a chip takes two extra passes through a scanner—and every other tool that is used to make those layers. And the company anticipates going to quadruple patterning at 7 nm, its next chip generation, says George Gomba, who is leading the company’s task of evaluating the technology at a SUNY Polytechnic Institute facility in Albany, along with colleagues from IBM. For now, GlobalFoundries plans to roll out its 7-nm chips in 2018 without EUV, but it is reserving the option of pulling the technology in when it is ready. A key question for Gomba and his colleagues is when the cost of EUV will break even with multiple patterning. And it’s a very tricky question to answer because it depends on a number of unknown factors, including how bright EUV light sources will become and the uptime of an entire EUV lithographic system—the percentage of time it’s actually available to be used.   Source: ASML; Illustration: Mark Montgomery Tin Power: To generate EUV, ASML’s light source hits a rapid-fire stream of molten tin droplets with laser pulses. The process begins beneath the fab floor, in a system that generates two sets of laser pulses. Each tin droplet is flattened by a “prepulse” and then hit with a “main pulse,” which heats the droplet to create a plasma. A collector mirror directs the resulting radiation into the scanner. GlobalFoundries and IBM are not the only ones that have poured money into EUV. In 2012, Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) committed a total of €1.38 billion in R&D funding to ASML for next-generation lithography research (the same deal garnered ASML €3.85 billion for nonvoting shares in the company). ASML’s Meiling estimates about 4,000 people work on EUV for the company, a figure that does not include the researchers at leading chipmakers and research institutions with EUV programs of their own. The reason for all this investment is not only that EUV is hard but that chipmakers are coming around to the idea that, soon, they may not be able to move forward without it. If you ask Anthony Yen, who leads EUV lithography development at TSMC, how critical EUV is to Moore’s Law, he won’t beat around the bush: “Totally critical. 100 percent critical. Very, very critical.” TSMC expects to adopt EUV in 2020, when the company aims to begin producing chips on its 5-nm manufacturing line. For now, though, there are still some engineering challenges. At the top of Yen’s list is protecting the mask, the stencil-like surface that carries a pattern to be printed on the wafer. Just as the optical components of the EUV scanner are reflective, so too is the mask. And here, once again, the pesky matter of reflectance becomes an issue. In a 193-nm immersion machine, the mask is protected by a thin film called a pellicle, which is suspended a short distance away and stretched across it like a piece of plastic wrap. At current feature sizes, a piece of dust too small to see with the naked eye is still big enough to blot out hundreds of transistors. Thanks to the magic of optics, if a piece of dust falls on the pellicle, it will be too out of focus to create a pattern on the wafer. But these 193-nm pellicles aren’t designed to be transparent to 13.5-nm light; EUV would quickly obliterate them. ASML planned to build the scanners without pellicles, but chipmakers weren’t comfortable with the potential downside. “If one particle gets on a mask,” Yen explains, “every single die on your wafer is damaged. Basically, you can end up with zero yield.” Months of work and, depending on the number of wafers produced, tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of chips would be lost. As a result, ASML has been researching ways to make a pellicle that can withstand the harsh onslaught of EUV radiation. The pellicle has to be as transparent as possible, so that little additional light is lost before it gets to the wafer. And it’s doubly difficult in this case: Because EUV masks are reflective rather than transmissive, light must go through a pellicle twice—once on the way in and once on the way out. There are still other challenges with EUV that its potential customers want to see resolved before they commit to the technology. One is the ability to make EUV masks free of defects—and develop efficient ways to confirm that they are in fact defect free. Another piece of the puzzle is the photoresist—the light-sensitive layer that is coated on a wafer to take a mask’s pattern. Today’s resists, known as chemically amplified resists, are made from polymeric chains of molecules that multiply the effect of incoming photons. But these materials are not especially efficient absorbers of EUV light, explains Andrew Grenville, CEO of the EUV-resist startup Inpria. What’s more, the recorded image tends to blur slightly as the light-triggered amplification reaction diffuses through the material. To make finer features than we have today, “you really need much smaller and more robust building blocks,” Grenville says. Inpria is working on a resist made of smaller tin-oxide components that are designed to absorb EUV five times as readily and create patterns without amplification. Will it all be ready in time to keep Moore’s Law from dissolving, either permanently or temporarily? Lithography expert Chris Mack doubts that all the pieces will come together for chipmakers by 2018. Planning for a new chip-manufacturing generation happens years in advance. Making a commitment to use EUV in just a few years’ time, he says, “is too risky.” Mack, a notorious EUV skeptic who once wagered his Lotus Elise sports car against the technology, does, however, admit to a “glimmer of hope” for it. Chipmakers are struggling to keep miniaturization on track and costs under control; the timing between successive chip generations seems to be getting longer, and chip features are not shrinking as aggressively as they used to. These struggles could give EUV an opening, he says: “There’s a real possibility that this slowdown in Moore’s Law could enable EUV to have enough time to catch up.” Enough time, that is, before costs cause Moore’s Law to grind to a halt. EUV may well reach a point where it is ready for adoption and will reduce manufacturing costs, Mack says. But by that point, he says, the overall cost of the next generation of advanced chips may prove too much—and the performance benefits not impressive enough—for chipmakers to pursue it. Already, Mack says, older chip-manufacturing generations are staying in the mix longer: “I think we’re going to see the marketplace splitting up and lots of companies doing lots of different things.” As it has in the past, the fate of Moore’s Law will hinge not only on how finely we can print features but on how well physicists and engineers can keep improving the resulting transistors and circuits. Even a rapid-fire sequence of tin plasma flashes won’t be able to shed any light on exactly when the world’s greatest technological winning streak will finally end. But it just might light the path ahead.  A version of this article appears in the November 2016 print issue as “The Molten Tin Solution.” Advertisement Recommended For You Breaking the Multicore Bottleneck For Racing Glory, Students Built a Mountain-Busting Electric Motorcycle Online Voting Isn’t as Flawed as You Think—Just Ask Estonia China’s 2,000-km Quantum Link Is Almost Complete Inside the Development of Light, the Tiny Digital Camera That Outperforms DSLRs Social Media’s Dial-Up Ancestor: The Bulletin Board System Learn More EUV lithography Moore's Law devices extreme ultraviolet lithography immersion lithography lithography optical lithography photolithography semiconductors Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Topics Aerospace At Work Biomedical Computing Energy Gadgets Geek Life Green Tech Robotics Semiconductors Telecom Transportation Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ RSS IEEE Spectrum Contact Us About Newsletters Mobile Site Reprints & Permissions IEEE Partners Advertising & Media Center IEEE Job Site Buyer’s Guide The Magazine Subscribe Now Digital Download © Copyright 2016 IEEE Spectrum Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies | Accessibility | Nondiscrimination Policy Join IEEE About IEEE Conferences & Events Education & Careers Membership & Services Publications and Standards Societies & Communities © Copyright 2016 IEEE — All rights reserved.

That said, the first benchmarks for the laptop have emerged, proving that the MacBook Air replacement is faster than last year’s base MacBook Pro option. DON’T MISS: Apple should kill the iPhone’s Lightning port next According to the first benchmark scores found on Geekbench, the entry level MacBook Pro sports an Intel i5-6360U Skylake processor that goes up to 6970 in tests. Comparatively, last year’s base 13-inch MacBook Pro has an average score of 6497. The high-end early 2015 MacBook Pro scores 6983, while the mid-range option reaches 6782 according to these tests. macbook-pro-late-2016-benchmark-1More What’s also important to note, aside from the marginal speed gains, is the energy efficiency of the new silicon. It might not be Intel’s latest chips powering the late 2016 MacBook Pro, but Skylake chips are more efficient than Broadwell-based 2015 Intel chips. According to MacRumors, the new chips consume 15-watt, which is almost half of the 28-watt power requirement of last year’s I5 chips. That’s why the 2016 MacBook Pro has comparable battery life to last year’s model even though Apple had to reduce battery size from 74.9-watt-hour to 54.5-watt-hour. The late 2016 MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and Touch ID will be available for testing in about a month, and they’re likely to score even higher than the dumb option, as they all ship with slightly faster chips.

The last decade has seen chipmakers shift strategy from faster-and-faster to more-and-more cores in search of performance improvements. Dual-core and quad-core chips have shown great benefits in modern PCs and devices, however scaling beyond to 8, 10, 16, or more cores provides diminishing returns. Worse still, poorly optimised software can lead to further speed-impacting hotspots on multi-core processors. The problem is down to the need for the CPU cores to communicate with each other to work in concert - but this process brings significant overhead with the proliferation of cores, explains a recent report published by IEEE Spectrum. One possible solution, devised by Intel and at NC State scientists, is moving the software queue to hardware. As explained in the above linked report, "This effectively turned three multistep ­software-queue operations into three simple instructions: Add data to the queue, take data from the queue, and put data close to where it's going to be needed next." In practical use a hardware queue management device (QMD) noticeably sped up tasks using data processing simulations. With QMD more cores show stronger gains – a 16 core CPU with QMD performed 20 times faster, for example. Furthermore, as the QMD is capable of simple computational functions it can aggregate data from multiple cores, expediting some basic computational functions. Interestingly the researchers tested expanding the QMD logic to handle other core-communications-dependent functions and got good results. This shows that moving frequently used software elements to hardware to find a sweet spot seems worthwhile going forward. Whether QMD logic will be added to future Intel processors is uncertain but Intel is spending money researching this tech, so it looks positive for the future as processors gain more and more cores.

Chips and chipsets that were compatible with Intel/IBM kit. They didn't need to cover the costs of R&D as they weren't producing anything innovative, so they could compete on price. Unfortunately Intel aggressively prices it's entry level chips too, top-loading the pricing on their high performance components that AMD can't touch.

Sarah Zhang personal frontiers Science Date of Publication: 10.31.16. 10.31.16 Time of Publication: 4:00 pm. 4:00 pm How Doctors Could One Day Use Your DNA to Cure You The Voorhes “I don’t mean to be morbid,” Eric Dishman told a friend as he was winding down his job at Intel. “But this may be the last time you see me.” Dishman, a longtime leader of the company’s health research division, was preparing to die. The kidney cancer he’d been diagnosed with in college had caught up to him two decades later. His kidneys had failed, and the chemo drug that kept him alive was incompatible with dialysis. Eric Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health.Joe PuglieseBut that friend happened to work for a DNA sequencing company, and he offered to analyze the genome of Dishman’s cancer cells. What could it hurt? Weeks later, Dishman got two 1-terabyte hard drives by courier, loaded with his genomic data. Another copy went to his doctors. And just days before he was to start dialy­sis—he already had the surgical port in his arm—his doctors called. Dishman’s kidney cancer mutations looked like they actually belonged to a form of pancreatic cancer. He switched to a drug designed for tumors in a totally different organ. It worked. Dishman is finally cancer-free after more than 20 years—and, following a successful kidney transplant, he now heads the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program at the National Institutes of Health. There, he’s in charge of recruiting 1 million Americans to share their DNA and medical histories for a massive study. As research like this pinpoints links between genetic variation and disease, doctors could someday look up a patient’s DNA and use it to prescribe custom treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Dishman’s case is still an anomaly. “I was ­triple lucky,” he says: lucky to have his DNA sequenced, lucky his doctors waded into the data, and lucky—most of all—that the information led to a cure. But Dishman hopes his million volunteers will help him discover more markers that lead to successful tailored treatments. And that would make the survival equation a little less luck and a lot more science. This article appears in our special November issue, guest-edited by President Barack Obama. Subscribe now.

Dr. Farhadi, a computer scientist at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence here, calls his advance "artificial intelligence at your fingertips." The experimental program could drastically lower the cost of artificial intelligence (AI) and improve privacy because you wouldn't need to share information over the internet. But the AI system is emblematic of something even more significant for the microelectronics industry as it inches closer to the physical limits of semiconductors made with silicon: It uses 1/32 of the memory and operates 58 times as fast as rival programs. There is a growing sense of urgency feeding this sort of research into alternative computing methods. For decades, computer designers have been able to count on cheaper and faster chips every two years. As transistors have shrunk in size, at regular intervals, computing has become both more powerful and cheaper at an accelerating rate - a concept known as Moore's Law. Two years ago, with manufacturing costs exploding and severe technical challenges growing, the cost of individual transistors stopped falling. That has ended - at least temporarily - the ability of computer makers to easily make new chips that are faster and cheaper. But if silicon has its limits, ingenuity may not. Better algorithms and new kinds of hardware circuits could help scientists continue to make computers that can do more and at a lower cost. "It's been a fun ride," said Thomas M Conte, an electrical engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "Today you're entering this patchwork world where you are going to find a better solution for a particular problem, and that's how we're going to advance in the future." This summer, for example, Intel acquired Nervana Systems, a small maker of specialised hardware designed to run AI programs more efficiently. Earlier this month, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory, Rice University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign published research demonstrating how a programming technique for an Intel microprocessor chip uses significantly less power to accomplish the same work. The new approach is significant, according to supercomputer designers, because the high energy requirements of the fastest computers have become the most daunting challenge as scientists try to move from today's petaflop - a quadrillion computations per second - machines to exaflop computers, which could perform a quintillion computations per second. Such computers are considered necessary to solve fundamental scientific problems like predicting the risk of climate change to the future of humanity. Because of the slowdown in Moore's Law, the arrival of exascale computing has repeatedly been pushed back. Though it was originally expected in 2018, projections now set the next generation off as far as 2023. The Argonne paper notes that a future supercomputer capable of an exaflop will multiply energy costs by a factor of a thousand. To reduce those energy demands, the researchers demonstrated how they used a conventional Intel chip and turned off half of its circuitry devoted to what engineers call mathematical precision. Then they "reinvested" the savings to improve the quality of the computed result. "Mathematical precision is like a knob you can turn," said Krishna V Palem, a Rice University computer scientist. "The question is what you do with the saved energy." The researchers experimented with using the various modes of the microprocessor in a manner similar to a gearshift in a car, automatically shifting from higher to lower precision and back as needed to solve a problem. "There is a lot to be done by thinking more carefully on how you can save energy," said Marc Snir, a veteran supercomputer designer and University of Chicago computer scientist. The Argonne researchers are exploring ideas put forward by Dr. Palem, who in 2003 first proposed an idea he described as "inexact computing." He suggested trading off precision to make dramatic gains in computing efficiency. Originally, he explored the idea of inexactness as a way to make use of imperfect chips where portions of the transistors were not working because of manufacturing flaws. More recently, he has turned to using his ideas to gain significant energy savings from today's common processors. Dr. Palem said that the group was planning to extend the Argonne research to more efficiently run mathematical models that relate to climate change. ©2016 The New York Times News Service John Markoff Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 DBS to buy ANZ Bank's business Business Standard Squeezing more out of chips to cut artificial intelligence cost John Markoff  |  Seattle  November 1, 2016 Last Updated at 00:05 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel reveals Kaby Lake desktop CPU and chipset lineups by Wayne Manion  12:06 PM on October 31, 2016 The specs for the desktop versions of Intel's "Kaby Lake" CPUs have leaked onto the internet, thanks to an Intel-provided PDF intended for manufacturing partners. In addition to that, a separate informational release confirms existing speculation that Intel has new chipsets on the way. Kaby Lake will work on many existing 100-series motherboards, but Intel will have 200-series chipsets ready for those who can't bear to mix a new CPU with an old motherboard. The leaked info provides limited data about desktop Kaby Lake Core i5, Core i7, and Xeon E3 chips. Core i3 SKUs are conspicuously absent, though. The leaked document contains base clock speeds, but Turbo Boost clocks, core counts, TDPs, and thread counts are not specified. The top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K will have a base clock of 4.2GHz, presumably with an unlocked multiplier and an arrangement of four cores and eight threads. The top Core i5, the i5-7600K, also likely unlocked, will probably have the same concert of four cores and four threads as previous high-end desktop i5 chips. A second leaked document names five new 200-series chipset SKUs, but provides no information about them save for revised handling procedures for a new type of packaging. The five desktop-oriented chipsets appear to be the B250, Q250, Q270, H270, and Z270. Intel also mentions two mysterious chipset names, C422 and X299. The C422 appears to be a workstation or server chipset for use with the Xeon E3-1205 v6. Meanwhile, the X299 moniker suggests an upcoming high-end chipset for desktop systems, likely to replace the X99.

The ATP DDR3L-1866 modules are available with capacities of 4GB and 8GB and address the need for low voltage (1.35V) DDR3 memory running at 1866MHz (instead of 1600 MHz). As a result they can maximize system performance when used in conjunction with Intel Apollo Lake processors. The new ECC SODIMM is available in both commercial temperature (CT 0°C to 85°C) and industrial temperature grade (IT -40°C to 95°C) options, providing the flexibility to meet the operating conditions of a wide variety of IoT (internet of things) systems. The industrial temperature range durability feature is especially beneficial in harsh environments and embedded applications such as industrial IoT and automation devices, telecommunication systems, healthcare technology and outdoor data collection systems. Intel Apollo Lake-based IoT and embedded systems are architected for operation with DDR3L memory running at 1866MHz and using ECC and non-ECC SODIMMs at full speed to achieve the best system performance. Until now, however, the general market has only provided DDR3L ECC SODIMMs capable of operating at 1600MHz. ATP is able to tune its ECC SODIMM technology to support operation at 1866MHz. The modules are designed, tuned, fully tested and validated without any system degradation or side effects. “The successful implementation and validation of the DDR3L ECC-SODIMM at 1866MHz demonstrates ATP’s leading technical know-how, and its creativity to bring a solution to maximize the throughput of the Intel IoT platforms,” said Jerry Wang, ATP DRAM Product Manager. “ATP looks forward to any opportunity to work with our current and future OEM/ODM and IPC partners on their IoT and industrial/embedded projects.” Further information on ATP products is available from local ATP sales representatives or by email to Info@atpinc.com or visit www.atpinc.com .

A startup that is designing a processor aimed specifically at machine learning and artificial intelligence applications is getting a $30 million boost from a range of investors, including Samsung. Graphcore, which has been working for the past two years in Bristol, England, laying the groundwork for its upcoming intelligent processing unit (IPU), came out of stealth mode Oct. 31 and announced the $30 million in Series A funding, which included not only investments from the Samsung Catalyst Fund but other venture capital firms like Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Amadeus Capital Partners and C4 Ventures. Company officials said the goal is to create processors that will speed up machine learning by 10 to 100 times over systems running on current processors from the likes of Intel and graphics engines from Nvidia and others. At the same time, Graphcore officials want to make artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible to a wide range of businesses, developers and devices. "Graphcore's mission is to make machine learning faster, easier and more intelligent," Graphcore co-founder and CEO Nigel Toon wrote in a post on the company blog. "Our technology will reduce the cost of accelerating AI applications in the cloud; the same technology will bring AI to low power consumer devices. It will enable recent deep learning applications to evolve more rapidly towards useful, general artificial intelligence. While innovation at the algorithmic level in machine learning has been unprecedented, the same cannot be said about processors." GPUs are getting a lot of attention in the deep learning space because they are the only parallel-processing chips on the market, Toon wrote. Microsoft is investigating field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)—chips that can be reprogrammed—but they are expensive and difficult to program, the CEO said. "These are stopgaps not long term solutions," Toon wrote. "Machine intelligence has a very different compute workload from anything that has come before and needs a new approach." Graphcore engineers are looking to build highly parallel processors that come with software tools and libraries that are faster, more flexible and easier to use than current offerings, he wrote. Graphcore officials expect to bring the first IPUs to market in 2017, powering what they are calling the IPU-Appliance that is designed to speed up AI applications in the cloud and in enterprise data centers while driving down the overall cost. The system will accelerate the training and inference tasks in machine learning operations by as much as 100 times, they said. The company is targeting such jobs as natural language capabilities, self-driving vehicles, personalized health care, intelligent mobile devices and robotics. AI refers to systems that can collect input (such as voice commands or images from the environments around them), process the data instantly and then react accordingly. It can be seen in such technologies as Siri on Apple iPhones and movie recommendation programs on Netflix, and will play an increasingly important role in other spaces, such as autonomous cars. Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at Nvidia, told eWEEK in September that "AI is everywhere. We believe it's the most important computing technology in the industry right now."

Download Drivers for MSI’s GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI Notebook The files are compatible with the Windows 10 64-bit platform Oct 31, 2016 11:34 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  MSI has rolled out all the drivers for its GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI notebook model compatible with the 64-bit version of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system, which should provide improved performance and usability. When it comes to the producers that have developed these files, Intel takes care of the chipset packages for the Management Engine (ME), Chipset, RST and RST Preinstall (Rapid Storage Technology), and Thunderbolt. In addition to that, Realtek ensures the well-functioning of the Card Reader and HD audio components, while Synaptics enables the notebook’s touchpad and implements several touch-related features. Last but not least, Rivet Networks ensures the Ethernet, Wireless LAN, and Bluetooth connections through the related drivers, while NVIDIA, along with Intel, fully enables the notebook's graphics chipsets (dedicated and embedded, respectively). As far as installation goes, to properly apply these drivers, just save and extract the files, run the available setups one at a time, and follow all instructions displayed on-screen for a complete upgrade. However, bear in mind that installing the drivers on other operating systems might result in malfunctions. Also, once finished, make sure to manually perform a system reboot (if not requested automatically) to ensure that all changes take effect. That said, if you own this device, download MSI GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI Drivers, apply them to the unit, don’t forget to perform a reboot, and constantly check our website to stay up to speed with the latest releases.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI#MSI#Notebook#Drivers reddit it! flip it share it tweet it MSI GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI Notebook (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Download Drivers for MSI’s X99A Gaming Pro Carbon Motherboard MSI’s GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook Receives Drivers for Windows 10 Download Drivers for MSI GT72VR 6RD Dominator Tobii Notebook Download Drivers for GT73VR TITAN and TITAN SLI Notebooks Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Panasonic Rolls Out Firmware 2.6 for its DMC-GH4 Camera - Download Now ASRock Rolls Out New BIOS Update for Some of Its Motherboards Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 5 photos    MSI GT73VR 6RE Titan SLI Notebook New Apps AVS Document Converter: Perform conversion operations between DOC, PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, HTML, GIF, PNG, EPUB, or other file format in a batch mode using this handy app Power-user: Take advantage of an extensive collection of templates, maps, diagrams, charts and illustrations, as well as a number of useful tools, by installing this handy PowerPoint add-in AIO Boot: Create a bootable USB drive or HDD with Grub2 or Clover, and integrate multiple support packages, with this minimalistic utility DxWnd: Open games and other applications that only run in full screen in a custom window mode that you can resize and lock anywhere on your screen with this app ChemPlot: Create chemical molecule structures using simple drawing tools wrapped in an intuitive interface, lock, group and edit objects, save projects and print results Portable Firefox: A reliable, fast and secure web browser that enables you to easily navigate on the Internet on the go, directly from a portable device GdPicture.NET Document Imaging SDK: Full-Featured and Royalty Free Document Imaging toolkit for .NET allows you to implement viewing, processing, printing or scanning files Reader comments NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now more on: GeForce 375.86 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Prototype SIMD vectorized code effortlessly. Download source code - 692 KB Introduction Introduction Simple Example Drawing a Circle Circle Cover Effect Hexagon Cover Effect History Reference Introduction Many a times, when we convert the computation code to SIMD using intrinsic, the SIMD code take more time and effort to write and it is unreadable and harder to maintain, compared to the scalar code. We do have to maintain a version of scalar code so that the application can fallback on when executed on a system without the SIMD support. More often than not, we discovered, to our dismay, the vectorized code is lower in performance. It is one thing to use well-optimized SIMD library and another to hand-code our own library using SIMD. In this article, we will introduce some SIMD vector class and their overloaded operators (+,-,*,/) that shipped with Visual C++ (the class are actually from Intel C++ Libraries) to ease our SIMD writing and lessen the effort to write readable SIMD code. Would you rather read/write z = x + y; or z = _mm_add_ps(x, y);? The answer is obvious. In this way, we can throw away our hand-written vectorized code without much heart pain in the event that they are found to be slower in execution. Simple Example Let me illustrate with an simple example of using SSE (not SSE2) float vector class, F32vec4, for integer to do addition of four numbers. F32vec4 is defined in the fvec.h header. F32vec4 vec1(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);
F32vec4 vec2(5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f);

F32vec4 result = vec1 + vec2; Without using the F32vec4 class and using pure SSE intrinsic, the code would be as follows. As you can see, using intrinsic, we have to either remember them or look them up in the documentation whenever we need to use them. For those who are looking into delaying the onset of dementia or Alzheimer, can try memorizing those hard-to-remember intrinsic names. __m128 vec1 = _mm_set_ps(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);
__m128 vec2 = _mm_set_ps(5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f);

__m128 result = _mm_add_ps(vec1, vec2); Below is the table which lists the vector classes and their associated header files from Optimizing software in C++ ebook. Vector class Size of each element, bits Number of elements Type of elements Total size of vector, bits Header file Is8vec8 8 8 char 64 ivec.h Iu8vec8 8 8 unsigned char 64 ivec.h Is16vec4 16 4 short int 64 ivec.h Iu16vec4 16 4 unsigned short int 64 ivec.h Is32vec2 32 2 int 64 ivec.h Iu32vec2 32 2 unsigned int 64 ivec.h I64vec1 64 1 __int64 64 ivec.h Is8vec16 8 16 char 128 dvec.h Iu8vec16 8 16 unsigned char 128 dvec.h Is16vec8 16 8 short int 128 dvec.h Iu16vec8 16 8 unsigned short int 128 dvec.h Is32vec4 32 4 int 128 dvec.h Iu32vec4 32 4 unsigned int 128 dvec.h I64vec2 64 2 __int64 128 dvec.h F32vec4 32 4 float 128 fvec.h F64vec2 64 2 double 128 dvec.h F32vec8 32 8 float 256 dvec.h F64vec4 64 4 double 256 dvec.h Optimizing software in C++: It is not recommended to use the 64-bit vectors in ivec.h because these are incompatible with floating point code. If you do use the 64-bit vectors then you have to execute _mm_empty() after the 64-bit vector operations and before any floating point code. The 128-bit vectors do not have this problem. The 256-bit vectors require that the AVX instruction set is supported by the microprocessor and the operating system. Most of the integer vector class do not support vector multiplication operations and all integer vector class do not support vector division operations, while float and double vector class do support vector addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Here is an example to implement your own integer (32bit) division operator using the scalar division. And of course, using scalar operation will be slower. static inline Is32vec4 operator / (Is32vec4 const & a, Is32vec4 const & b) 
{
    Is32vec4 ans;
    ans[0] = a[0] / b[0];
    ans[1] = a[1] / b[1];
    ans[2] = a[2] / b[2];
    ans[3] = a[3] / b[3];
    return ans;
} Drawing a Circle We will use the F32vec4 class (128 bit float vector) to draw a circle. I'll show a plain scalar C++ code to do it first. The code uses Pythagorean theorem to determine if the pixel falls within the circle. Using X and Y coordinates from the center of the circle, we calculate the hypotenuse, using sqrt(X2+Y2). The hypotenuse is the pixel distance from the center point. If it is smaller than the radius, then it is within the circle and the pixel should be set to green color. // Draw Circle without optimization

    // ... non-relevant GDI+ code is not shown here

    if( !pixelsCanvas )
        return;

    UINT col = 0;
    int stride = bitmapDataCanvas.Stride >> 2;

    float fPointX = 100.0f; // x coordinates of the circle center
    float fPointY = 100.0f; // y coordinates of the circle center
    float fRadius = 40.0f; // radius of the circle center

    float fy=0.0f;
    float fx=0.0f;

    UINT color = 0xff00ff00;
    for(UINT row = 0, fy=0.0f; row < bitmapDataCanvas.Height; row+=1, fy+=1.0f)
    {
        for(col = 0, fx=0.0f; col < bitmapDataCanvas.Width; col+=1, fx+=1.0f)
        {
            // calculate the index of destination pixel array
            int index = row * stride + col;

            // Subtract center X from the pixel X coordinates
            float X = fx - fPointX;
            // Subtract center Y from the pixel Y coordinates
            float Y = fy - fPointY;

            // compute the square of X, that is X * X = X to power of 2
            X = X * X;
            // compute the square of Y, that is Y * Y = Y to power of 2
            Y = Y * Y;

            // Add up the X square and Y square
            float hypSq = X + Y;

            // Find the hypotenuse by computing square root
            float hyp = std::sqrt(hypSq);

            UINT origPixel = pixelsCanvas[index];
            if(hyp<=fRadius)
            {
                pixelsCanvas[index] = color;
            }
            else
            {
                pixelsCanvas[index] = origPixel;
            }
        }
    }

    graphics.DrawImage(m_pSrcBitmap,0,0,
      m_pSrcBitmap->GetWidth(),m_pSrcBitmap->GetHeight());
} I have to admit this is an inefficient way to draw circle. A better and faster way is to draw a circle with a stroke and then use floodfill to fill the circle with a solid color. And there is also no antialiasing at the circle boundary. Our demo at the end requires circles to be drawn in such a way. Below is the version written with intrinsic (not using F32vec4 yet). I will not try to explain this intrinsic version but I'll explain the F32vec4 version. Both version are similar. // Draw Circle with SIMD intrinsic
void CScratchPadDlg::OnPaint()
{
    // ... non-relevant GDI+ code is not shown here

    UINT col = 0;
    int stride = bitmapDataCanvas.Stride >> 2;

    float fPointX = 100.0f; // x coordinates of the circle center
    float fPointY = 100.0f; // y coordinates of the circle center
    float fRadius = 40.0f; // radius of the circle center

    // vector of 4 x coordinates of the circle center
    __m128 vecPointX = _mm_set_ps1(fPointX);
    // vector of 4 y coordinates of the circle center
    __m128 vecPointY = _mm_set_ps1(fPointY);
    // vector of 4 radius of the circle center
    __m128 vecRadius = _mm_set_ps1(fRadius);

} The benchmark result is as below. Intel i7 CPU (Quad Core) Debug Mode

Release Mode

Scalar : 4ms
SSE Intrinsic : 1ms
SSE vector class : 1ms. As the reader can see, the benchmark result for the SSE vector in debug build is very bad and is not acceptable for our demo application which animates the expanding circle on a interval of 30 milliseconds. The reason is probably because in debug build, the inline constructor and methods are not inline'd by the compiler. I work around it by always running the program in release mode. After all, it is a simple graphics program which does not need debugging, I figure out what is wrong by observing. Now I begin to explain the previous code snippet. float fPointX = 100.0f; // x coordinates of the circle center
float fPointY = 100.0f; // y coordinates of the circle center
float fRadius = 40.0f; // radius of the circle center

// vector of 4 x coordinates of the circle center
F32vec4 vecPointX(fPointX);
// vector of 4 y coordinates of the circle center
F32vec4 vecPointY(fPointY);
// vector of 4 radius of the circle center
F32vec4 vecRadius(fRadius); This code merely initialize the two vector of X coordinates and Y coordinates of the circle center. The third vector is circle radius. float fy=0.0f;
float fx=0.0f;

UINT color = 0xff00ff00;
for(UINT row = 0, fy=0.0f; row < bitmapDataCanvas.Height; row+=1, fy+=1.0f)
{
    for(col = 0, fx=0.0f; col < bitmapDataCanvas.Width; col+=4, fx+=4.0f)
    {
        // calculate the index of destination pixel array
        int index = row * stride + col;

        // vector of X coordinates of the 4 pixels, it is inverse of of little endian
        F32vec4 vecX(fx+3.0f, fx+2.0f, fx+1.0f, fx+0.0f);
        // vector of Y coordinates of the 4 pixels
        F32vec4 vecY((float)(fy)); This is a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates the rows while the inner loop iterates every 4 columns. vecX and vecY are the columns and rows of the pixels. You may have noticed that the float arguments to vecX constructor is reversed. This is due to little endianness of Intel processor. Below is what it looks like if they are not reversed. // Subtract center X from the pixel X coordinates
vecX -= vecPointX;
// Subtract center Y from the pixel Y coordinates
vecY -= vecPointY;

// compute the square of X, that is X * X = X to power of 2
vecX = vecX * vecX;
// compute the square of Y, that is Y * Y = Y to power of 2
vecY = vecY * vecY;

// Add up the X square and Y square
F32vec4 vecHypSq = vecX + vecY;

// Find the hypotenuse by computing square root
F32vec4 vecHyp = sqrt(vecHypSq); Now we subtract the circle center from the XY coordinates of the pixels to get where the pixels are in relative to te circle center. We may get a negative X or Y result but we do not have to convert them to the absolute value because the next multiplication operation to compute for the squared value (e.g., X2, Y2), will convert negative values to positive values because the product of two negative numbers gives a positive result. The rest of the code computes the hypotenuse. // Generate the mask for condition of hypotenuse < radius
F32vec4 mask = cmple(vecHyp, vecRadius); The first statement generates a mask if the hypotenuse of the triangle is less than the circle radius. The mask is all ones (0xffffffff) when the condition is true, else is all zeroes // all 4 pixel in mask vector, falls within the width

} The first if condition test whether column + 3 is less than the image width. If it is, it will assign the color to the pixelCanvas[i] according if the mask is 0xffffffff. If mask is all zeros, the original color will be applied to pixelCanvas[i] instead. The else block executes when column + 3 is more than the image width and we have to test every pixel whether it is within the boundary before assigning the color to pixelCanvas[i]. Out of curiosity, I modified the earlier code snippet to draw a circle with a gradient. You noticed the gradients color 'spiked' into the center. This is okay because our final demo does not involve gradients. // Draw Circle with gradient

} Circle Cover Effect In this section, we are going to use the code which we developed previously for drawing circle to implement a circle cover effect where a circle keep expanding and exposing the image underneath. So how does the code know when to stop expanding (that is when the entire image is already covered/replaced)? Look at the image below. When you mouse-click on the client area, the distance from the 4 corner are calculated and the longest distance (red line) is selected as the maximum radius to expand. Tip: you can replace the flickr1.jpg and flickr2.jpg in the res folder with your own images (just rename them to be flickr1.jpg and flickr2.jpg but their dimension have to be equal), the CircleCover application will automatically resize its client dimension to be the same as the 1st embedded image on startup. Hexagon Cover Effect The hexagon cover effect is similar to the circle cover application. The only difference is the expanding edge is replaced by little hexagons. As with the CircleCover application, you can replace the images before compilation. This is how it works. The difference between each hexagon center and the mouse point is calculated. If the difference is greater than the hexagon, then the hexagon should be displayed. If the difference is smaller, then a pre-computed mask (which store the distance of each pixel from the hexagon center) is used to determine whether the pixel underneath should be displayed. I did not convert this application to use SSE, simply because the speed gain will not be much as the number of distance to compute between each hexagon center and the mouse point, are not many. And the distance of each pixel from the hexagon center is pre-computed as a mask. I leave it as a exercise for the reader to convert this code to use SSE. The source code is heavily commented. Conclusion We has seen how to use the SIMD vector class provided by Visual Studio for code clarity and code speedup. However, we have also seen the speed penalty in debug build is quite bad (40x). Only simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root are provided by SIMD vector class. There is no trigonometry functions (like sine and cosine). This is why I restricted my effect to use Pythagorean theorem. The source code is hosted at CodePlex.

Slowness in debug Chris Losinger31-Oct-16 4:34 Chris Losinger 31-Oct-16 4:34  Quote:The reason is probably because in debug build, the inline constructor and methods are not inline'd by the compiler. It's probably because of the way the compiler handles register usage in debug mode, with certain optimizations set (I forget which). I've found that, in debug mode, the compiler keeps almost nothing in SSE/XMM registers between calls - it actually writes all of the 'return' values from the intrinsics out to memory and then reads the value back to a register for the next call. For example, in debug mode, this: __m128i Z = _mm_setzero_si128(); becomes: pxor	xmm0, xmm0
movdqa	XMMWORD PTR $T209723[ebp], xmm0
movdqa	xmm0, XMMWORD PTR $T209723[ebp]
movdqa	XMMWORD PTR _Zeros$[ebp], xmm0 Which is ridiculous.

Good code; algorithm could be better Phil Atkin21-Feb-12 0:12 Phil Atkin 21-Feb-12 0:12  I've written SIMD code in assembler; anything that makes it easier to apply this technology has to be good news! I commend your efforts in this regard. But you haven't chosen a good example to optimize. It's usually much more important to use an efficient algorithm than to code it efficiently - particularly in the case of imaging operations. In this case you state that the algorithm isn't efficient, but the alternative you mention (flood fill) would be even worse! With image operations you should always think most about the inner loop: try to make it as simple as possible, and with as few branches as possible. The clue in the case of the circle drawing should be that, apart from the endpoints, each pixel is identical. All the conditional code, including the square root, is redundant. A far better algorithm is to calculate the positions of the endpoints of each chord (horizontal line) of the circle. You need just one square root per line. You then have the endpoints of a horizontal line, which can be conveniently drawn with the graphics processor. Alternatively, to do the sort of "cover effect" you describe, you can use a simple copy loop between the endpoints. By the way, if you really need to test every pixel for inclusion in the circle (you don't if you adopt my suggestion above), much better to proceed as follows: * Calculate r2 = r * r, the square of the radius, outside the loops. * Calculate y2 = Y*Y in the outer (y) loop, since it doesn't change in the inner loop. * Your test is then X*X + y2 < r2 - this avoids the square root. I realize that the point of your article is to describe the helper classes, not to expound on circle-drawing algorithms. But in my view it's always better to use an example that shows a useful gain from the application of the technique. Phil Atkin Cambridge, UK Totally right, but... KarstenK16-Dec-14 4:36 KarstenK 16-Dec-14 4:36  for demonstration purposes is it a good example. The algorithm is the MOST significant optimization. The second: use a short algorithm. The last but not least: only optimize if you really need Press F1 for help or google it.

Working in conjunction with the U.S. Border Patrol, the primary mission is to detect transnational threats to the homeland in order to prevent terrorists’ weapons, including, weapons of mass destruction, from entering the United States. Several drug trafficking organizations smuggle high volumes of illegal narcotics from Mexico to the United States for mass distribution. Drug smugglers use the heavy vegetation of to avoid surveillance and observation from U.S. Border Patrol in an attempt to evade detention and processing. When apprehended by USBP, undocumented aliens or UDAs are processed and then are transferred to other government agencies for final disposition such as release with court date or deportation. In cases where drugs are involved, the drugs are confiscated and handed over to the Drug Enforcement Agency for proper disposal. Having the Marines there provides a second set of eyes to support the mission. Marines place these sensors along the border in areas of interest known to be popular for crossing. “These sensors allow the border patrol agents to cover more territory with fewer personnel, allowing them to capture UDA’s and Drug Trafficking Organizations personnel smuggling narcotics from Mexico into the U.S.,” said Col. Russ Draper, the Regional Support Team Chief, Joint Task Force North. “The Marines are providing a valuable service by helping to increase the capacity to secure the border.” Another device Marines use is an imager, which set up similar to a sensor, is not easily detected. Unlike a sensor, when the imager is activated it captures a picture which can make for easy identification of traffickers. “The Marine Corps is providing a unique capability that not many organizations have,” Draper said. “Their professionalism and behavior is impacting JTF-N and enhancing the relationships with the partners they work alongside.” Marines rotated 12 or 24 hour duty evolutions depending on the station they were at. During their duty, Marines watched for activations and when they saw something suspicious they would call it in to the Border Patrol, who would relay the message to agents they have in that area to investigate. The set-up of some of the stations allowed the Marines to work side-by-side with the Border Patrol agents, but for other stations it is important they maintained good communication with each other. With good cooperation, it makes working together easier and allows the group to achieve their common goal. “It’s been a lot of fun, and is really cool to work with another government agency,” said a tactical remote sensor systems technician with 3rd Intel Bn, GSP. “We learn a lot from each other which makes for a really good experience.” Working with the Border Patrol provided mutual benefits for the Marines. Not only were they able to help, but as a deployment they gained experience in handling and utilizing their equipment. “We have been coming out here for several years now,” said the section leader with 2nd Intel Bn, GSP. “It’s a great way to employ our gear and get real-world training. You can’t recreate this kind of environment and it allows us to test all our capabilities with our equipment.” In past years, the Marines had supported a two-month mission where they would spend only a little time at each station before moving on to the next. This year’s mission enabled them to bring more gear and cover a greater expanse of the border so they could monitor all stations for the entire operation. “We love supporting the Border Patrol and want to catch the illicit activity that comes across just as much as they do,” said the section leader with 2nd Intel Bn, GSP. “The mission allows us to support the Border Patrol for an extended period of time without losing coverage along the border.” With great success during the operation, the Marines have high hopes of returning in the upcoming years. “We all play a really pivotal role here and we work well together,” said a tactical remote sensor systems technician with 3rd Intel Bn, GSP. “I believe we’ll have a lot of success in the future.” LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 09.01.2016 Date Posted: 10.30.2016 13:38 Story ID: 213275 Location: TX, US Web Views: 249 Downloads: 0 Podcast Hits: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN   This work, Marines, USBP Team up to Protect Border, by Cpl Brianna Gaudi, identified by DVIDS, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

Trial opens for 15-year-old charged in killing of girl, 16 News Maryland Crime Former Maryland prison officials say firings harm corruption fight Michael DresserContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Two fired officials say Maryland's prison investigation unit is being dismantled. Top officials fired last week by the department that runs Maryland's prison system said their former unit's ability to investigate corruption is being thwarted amid innuendo and bureaucratic infighting. Steve Geppi and Debra Gonzalez Morin ran the investigation and intelligence operations at the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. They told The Baltimore Sun they were suspended just one week after they played key roles in putting together a case in which 80 people — including 18 correctional officers — were charged with corruption at a prison on the Eastern Shore. Geppi and Gonzalez Morin said they received no explanation when they were fired about two weeks later by Secretary Stephen T. Moyer. They contend they were brought down by baseless allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship. "For me, that shows a lack of backbone at the very top," said Geppi, a 24-year veteran of the Maryland State Police who said he was hired by Moyer with the charge of eliminating corruption in the scandal-plagued prison system. "When the going got rough, he caved in at the knees." Gonzalez Morin, a 16-year veteran of the department who had run the intelligence unit since 2013, said seven other members of her team have since been put on administrative leave. "If you think anyone would want to be in Intel now, after seeing this, it's not going to happen," she said. Three Maryland public safety officials leave jobs following misconduct investigation Michael Dresser and Justin Fenton Three high-level officials in the Maryland department that runs the state prison system, including its top intelligence officer, have been removed from office after being investigated for alleged misconduct. The three officials in the office of Secretary Stephen T. Moyer were removed from the state... Three high-level officials in the Maryland department that runs the state prison system, including its top intelligence officer, have been removed from office after being investigated for alleged misconduct. The three officials in the office of Secretary Stephen T. Moyer were removed from the state... (Michael Dresser and Justin Fenton) State personnel law forbids department officials to explain disciplinary actions against state employees. The secretary declined to be interviewed but released a statement. "Management must be held to the same high standards as any other member of this department. In fact, they should be held to a higher standard because of their level of responsibility," Moyer said. "Our former employees absolutely know the allegations against them and understood that they served at the will of the secretary." He denied the firings and suspension would hurt anti-corruption efforts. Feds charged 80 people with racketeering conspiracy at Maryland prisons A federal grand jury has indicted 80 defendants for racketeering conspiracy operating at the Eastern Correctional Institution in Westover, Maryland. (Baltimore Sun video) A federal grand jury has indicted 80 defendants for racketeering conspiracy operating at the Eastern Correctional Institution in Westover, Maryland. (Baltimore Sun video) See more videos "Our intelligence and internal investigation units remain strong," he said. Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan, said the governor stands behind Moyer. "The secretary has the green light from the governor to handle allegations of misconduct in the manner he feels is most appropriate, especially allegations of sexual misconduct," Mayer said. Moyer, a former Maryland State Police lieutenant colonel, was brought in when Hogan took office in January 2015 with a mandate to clean up corruption. The investigation at the Eastern Correctional Institution found evidence of a conspiracy to smuggle contraband including heroin, cocaine, cell phones and pornography into the Somerset County prison. Prosecutors charged that 18 corrections officers, 35 inmates and 27 others took part in the scheme. The indictment accuses officers of taking bribes and in some cases having sex with inmates. Geppi, 64, said he and Gonzales Morin, 51, were staunch allies in the effort to root out corruption. They insist they are nothing more than friends and colleagues. The two said they were surprised Oct. 11 when they were put on administrative leave amid reports of unspecified misconduct. Geppi said his team was praised and applauded at a meeting with Moyer that morning for their role in the ECI investigation. "In the morning I got an ovation. In the afternoon I got suspended," he said. Both said that while suspended, they were interrogated by David Kitzinger, commander of the Maryland State Police internal affairs unit. Geppi and Gonzalez Morin said questions focused on the night of Oct. 4 at a hotel outside Salisbury, where federal and state law enforcement officers slated to take part in arrests the next day gathered to prepare. Geppi and Gonzalez Morin said the investigator asked them about an alleged sex party. They said he asked about drinking that night and about room assignments. Gonzalez Morin said she was asked how many times she used an access door to a room adjoining her own — one she said she hadn't noticed. Both said they committed no sexual misconduct and knew of none involving team members. Greg Shipley, spokesman for the Maryland State Police, said an investigation is continuing and that he could not comment on any findings. Geppi said tensions had been growing between himself and the public safety department's internal affairs division. He said he believed it was not shouldering a sufficient caseload. He said Gonzales Morin's stepped-up vetting of officers in line for promotions had generated more cases that required investigation, leading to resentment. Some professional associates of Geppi and Gonzalez Morin said they are highly capable and ethical. Moyer said Monday that David A.

News & Analysis U.S. Convenes Chip Study Group White House explores China, Moores law Rick Merritt 10/31/2016 05:30 PM EDT 9 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – In the final weeks of his administration, President Obama has convened a group of semiconductor veterans to study the top issues affecting the chip industry in the U.S. The group is expected to submit a report to the next administration recommending significantly higher federal spending on semiconductor research. A new working group under the well-established President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) will look at ways to strengthen the U.S. industry in the face of competition from China and the growing cost and complexity of pursuing Moore’s law. “Some countries that are important in this domain are subsidizing their domestic semiconductor industry or requiring implicit transfer of technology and intellectual property in exchange for market access,” the White House said in a thinly veiled reference to China in a statement online announcing the new work group. Indeed, China has prepared a $20 billion investment fund in semiconductors. It also helped organize a $100 billion private fund to spur increasingly active investments in chip M&A deals. “The industry may also be approaching technological and economic inflection points,” around the slowing pace of Moore’s law, the new U.S. group added. Indeed, Intel is already stretching out its time between process nodes beyond the traditional 18-24 months. Engineers are working harder to find new ways to deliver performance increases and power and price declines given traditional scaling techniques are breaking down as processes approach physical limits. The statement suggested it will recommend “additional public and private investments in R&D” as part of a “set of recommendations on initial actions the Federal government, industry, and academia could pursue to maintain U.S. leadership in this crucial domain.” It gave no specifics of how long it will take to arrive at those recommendations. In a sign of the importance the administration gives the issues, it appointed a top White House technology advisor and PCAST chair John Holdren to co-chair the work group along with former Intel chief executive Paul Otellini. Other members of the group include: Wes Bush, CEO of Northrop Grumman John Hennessy, President Emeritus of Stanford Paul Jacobs, Executive Chairman of Qualcomm Ajit Manocha, former CEO of GlobalFoundries Craig Mundie, a former senior advisor to Microsoft Mike Splinter, former CEO of Applied Materials Laura Tyson, a professor at UC Berkeley and NEC Director The Semiconductor Industry Association recommended forming such a task force on policy for the semiconductor industry, SIA chief John Neuffer said in an online statement applauding the move. Its very important for the U.S. government to signal the semiconductor industry is important to the U.S economy and national security, said Neuffer in an interview. The SIA has long lobbied Washington to raise federal spending on semiconductor research and lower U.S. statutory tax rates which at 35% are higher than rates of competing countries. It also has lobbied for more visas for foreign-born students receiving advanced STEM degrees in the U.S. and for expanding free trade with deals including the Trans Pacific Partnership, a position neither current presidential candidate supports. Separately the SIA has started work on a report outlining the industrys vision for the chip sector's road map. As many as a dozen small groups have been helping the SIA draft the document which it will finish before the end of the year. Next week, the SIA will host the first gathering for the whole group working on the vision statement. The new PCAST group comes after years of lobbying an administration that is widely seen as closely engaged with the tech community. Obama’s recovery act funded work on smarter electric grids, a manufacturing effort spawned numerous research centers and policy efforts at the FCC sought to protect so-called Net neutrality. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: On Chinas List: Memory, Market Share, M&A Chinas Chip Jackpot Teases Intel Debuts 14nm+ Processors Moore on his Law and More Email This Print Comment More Related Links Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Electronica: CEO Forum Rambles on IoT Security, Safety Chip Forecast Rises Through 2017 ASML Invests $1.9B in Next-Gen EUV U.S. Needs Big Bet on Chips Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Can private industry in the US really resist China and its Trillions ? lilzz   11/6/2016 12:13:10 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate what a bunch of BS.

Massacre of '89 ) the PRC became an attractive source of regimented low cost labor for our "Masters of the Universe" and Wall St. started pushing low tech US Corp.s to outsource their manufacturing to China. Even high tech Co.s like the now defunct Motorola were baited by fraudulent US consultants ( with Ivy League pedigree ) w/ visions of monopolizing the huge Chinese market ( which back in the early '90s was almost non existent  ) but being naive Mid Westerners got their "clocks cleaned", their technology ( e,g. Base Stations ) pirated, the whole Corp. compromised by a termite like invasion. Guided by Henry Kissinger who has been on the pay of Communist China for the last 4 decades and aided by his "cousins and nephews" on Wall St. and Ivy League, China knows exactly how to exploit US weaknesses and has done so very effectively for the last 30 years. The results are for all to see. Their huge war chest to acquire semiconductor companies are just the tip of the iceberg. The Trillions that China made by maufactiuring Shirts, Shoes and Toys ( and later assembling Consumer Electronics too ) have been turned into Military strength to challenge the US not just in E. Asia but also around the World. Just yesrday they demonstrtaed their brand new Stealth Fighter at an Air Show ! What is to stop China buying small & hungry technology Co.s in the USA ? Just last year they bought a smallish Co. in our City that was originally started by people from Motorola to replicate some of the Adv. Packaging that I myself had pioneered. Now those guys have been pushed out and China has access to technology for 3d integration. All bets are off unless Obama's successor RIGHTAWAY creates a FUND aimed at start ups and small technology Co.s in the US so as to protect them from predatory acquisitions by China or its surrogates ( unfortunately now that includes even some NATO member countries ). The same goes for hiring practices at Grad Schools, University faculty as well as Industry so as to stop the "free for all" spying and piracy thats been going on for the last quarter century. Restoring US COMPETITIVENESS and stopping the technology hemmorhage should be HIS Top Goal. Roads and Bridges will follow automatically once there are enough well paid and productive jobs and the Tax Base is restored.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Hope for better mixed signal design rick merritt   11/1/2016 1:44:34 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate @MWagner_MA  We have been hearing about this problem for years.

One of the biggest announcements out of Apple's MacBook event last week was the unveiling of the new MacBook Pro keyboard, which includes a feature dubbed the Touch Bar. This OLED display at the top of the keyboard has two nifty features.

Second, it is a screen that runs the length of the keyboard and provides context-aware buttons, actions, and UI depending on which app is currently selected on the main Mac screen. Developers, we'll show you how to create Touch Bar extensions for your apps, and how to use the Touch Bar simulator to run the apps you build for Touch Bar. SEE: New MacBook Pro is an Intel/ARM hybrid, and here's why it's a big deal (TechRepublic) Human Interface Guidelines for Touch Bar Before you start writing apps for the Touch Bar on macOS Sierra, it's important that you read and understand Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for Touch Bar. This guide has all of the information you need to know about the touch interaction and UI elements that the Touch Bar apps can include. SEE: Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016) review (CNET) Building an NSTouchBar app Building a Touch Bar app utilizes the class known as NSTouchBar. You can implement this in your window controllers where each window can contain its own custom Touch Bar. The window controller conforms to the NSTouchBarProvider delegate by default, so you only need to override the methods called makeTouchBar() and touchBar(_ touchBar: NSTouchBar, makeItemForIdentifier identifier: NSTouchBarItemIdentifier). The first methods returns an NSTouchBar instance that has placeholders for the items that are included on the bar (such as label, button, etc.), and the second method is where you will configure each item on the Touch Bar and return those items to the system. The following is an example of these two methods. @available(OSX 10.12.1, *)
    override func makeTouchBar() -> NSTouchBar? {
        
        let touchBarIdenitifier = NSTouchBarCustomizationIdentifier(rawValue: "com.corybohon.TouchBarExample")
        let touchBarLabelIdentifier = NSTouchBarItemIdentifier(rawValue: "com.corybohon.TouchBarExample.label")
        
        let touchBar = NSTouchBar()
        touchBar.delegate = self
        touchBar.customizationIdentifier = touchBarIdenitifier
        touchBar.defaultItemIdentifiers = [touchBarLabelIdentifier, .fixedSpaceLarge, .otherItemsProxy]
        touchBar.customizationAllowedItemIdentifiers = [touchBarLabelIdentifier]
        
        return touchBar
    }
    
    @available(OSX 10.12.1, *)
    func touchBar(_ touchBar: NSTouchBar, makeItemForIdentifier identifier: NSTouchBarItemIdentifier) -> NSTouchBarItem? {
        
        if identifier.rawValue == "com.corybohon.TouchBarExample.label" {
            let custom = NSCustomTouchBarItem(identifier: identifier)
            custom.customizationLabel = "Label"
            
            let label = NSTextField.init(labelWithString: "Hello, World!")
            custom.view = label
            
            return custom
        }
        
        return nil
        
    } In the above code, a Touch Bar is created that has a single label that says "Hello, World!" The only other code needed is to conform to NSTouchBarDelegate and implement the method to handle taps on the items. This method gets called whenever the user taps a Touch Bar item. For more information on getting up and running with Touch Bar in your macOS apps, check out the documentation for NSTouchBar. Running an app that uses NSTouchBar When you run an app that implements NSTouchBar, you can open the Touch Bar simulator by selecting Xcode | Window | Show Touch Bar. The Touch Bar will appear on the screen as a floating modal that appears over the top of all other windows (Figure A). You can even navigate around the system and see the Touch Bar in action, changing to match the current app that's on screen. Figure A The Touch Bar as it appears when running the sample code from above. Notice the "Hello World!" label placed on the right hand side. Touch ID on Mac Another addition to the new MacBook Pros and the macOS available APIs is the addition of the same LocalAuthentication framework found on iOS. You can use the exact same code from your iOS apps that support Touch ID to request authentication with the user's fingerprint. Do this in your Swift-based project by using the following code for basic LocalAuthentication fingerprint checking. import LocalAuthentication
    
    let context = LAContext()
    let reasonString = "Touch ID Authorization"
    
    var authError: NSError? = nil
    
    if context.canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, error: &authError) {
    
        context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: reasonString) { (success, evaluateError) in
            // TODO: Handle success or failure here
        }
    } else {
        // TODO: Device doesn't have Touch ID, handle appropriately here
    } The above code simply asks the user to authenticate with their fingerprint. You receive a Boolean value that determines whether the user's fingerprint check succeeded or failed.

My intention is to inform the public about critical facts that are missing from the discussion about the taxation of the marijuana industry, and why they should view with skepticism the major claim of Proposition 205 proponents; namely, that the legalization will bring in additional tax revenue, particularly for schools. The marijuana industry in Arizona has failed to follow basic state law regarding the listing and reporting of their business personal property in Arizona. What is business personal property? Basically, every business owns personal property that they utilize to operate their business. This can range from basic things like computers, office furniture and storage racks to specialized equipment that a marijuana growing facility might use like grow boxes, air filtration systems, misting and drip systems, special lighting. These items all have value and must be reported to the county assessor in the county that they are located each year. The law requiring the listing and reporting of business personal property is a self-reporting, or “on-your-honor” system, which law-abiding businesses in this state comply with. Businesses as large as Intel, Discount Tire, Wal-Mart, and then on down to those smaller “mom and pop” business owners do their best to accurately and timely report business personal property to my office. In fact, there are nearly 10,000 separate business personal property accounts listed with the Maricopa County Assessor’s Office. Marijuana business owners, growers and dispensaries, on the other hand, have failed to file anything since they became legal to operate in 2012. By my best estimates, there are approximately 50 dispensaries in Maricopa County, and not a single one has complied with the law. Why does this matter? Because nearly 70 percent of taxes collected from the assessment of business personal property taxes goes to fund local education. This means that non-compliance by the marijuana industry in Arizona in listing their business personal property and their subsequent failure to pay any taxes whatsoever is impacting the education of our children. After the Great Recession, with leadership from Governor Ducey, Arizonans approved Proposition 123 to get over $1 billion in new funding to schools. Yet, at the same time state leaders are looking for ways to obtain more dollars for schools, the marijuana industry shirks their legal obligations to pay their fair share of taxes on the personal property used in the creation of a product still illegal under federal law. I hear talk by the marijuana industry that the passage of recreational marijuana will bring more tax dollars into Arizona, and also that the passage of Proposition 205 will legitimize what has previously been a black market business. My response is, how can we trust the marijuana industry, which will be, by law, comprised  of the same actors already in business, to act like legitimate business owners when they have evaded their responsibility to follow the law like everyone else? There is an old saying that bears repeating here: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.” Arizonans would be wise to remember this when they decide how they vote on Proposition 205. I, however, refuse to be made the fool by the marijuana industry and will vote “No” on November 8.

One might expect a tax assessor to be consistently hard on these issues. Where’s Petersen’s renunciation of Trump? Nowhere. More hypocrisy. Dave K October 31, 2016 , 11:02 am at 11:02 am The crooks that support this prohibition are truly getting desperate and they care little about protecting people in Arizona. They ignore that many in Arizona already use marijuana and that our underground market is controlled by some of the most violent criminals in the hemisphere, the Mexican drug cartels. These folks do not ask for ID’s and they also make available fentanyl, cocaine, crystal meth, ecstasy, and black tar heroin to our kids. Call me crazy but it makes sense to me to have marijuana sold by legal retailers who do not sell other drugs and ask for ID’s. This is working to decrease underground sales in Colorado. While they fight marijuana that has never killed by overdose in all of human history they ignore the fact that more Arizonans die of opiate overdose deaths than die of traffic accidents. We need to focus our priorities on those substances that do kill Arizonans. “The elimination of the unregulated black market is often cited by legalization proponents as a benefit of creating a legal, commercial marijuana market. In Colorado and Washington, those black markets have persisted to an extent, frustrating regulators and providing fodder for legalization critics. The new report suggests, however, that the black market is being significantly reduced by legalization, and that those reductions will continue.” http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-colorado-marijuana-industry-20161031-story.html Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

There are plenty of reasons to disagree. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 31, 2016 at 1:42PM Image source: IBM. Shares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) haven't fared well over the past few years. Revenue and earnings have been in a prolonged slump as IBM aims to transform itself, and the market hasn't shown much patience. The stock is down about 30% from its peak in 2013. Despite the poor performance of the stock, IBM is still a great company worth buying and holding for the long run. Here are 10 reasons to buy IBM and never sell. 1. A long track record of adaptation Founded over a century ago, IBM originally manufactured and sold products such as commercial scales, cheese slicers, and tabulators. Recognizing that its lucrative mechanical tabulating equipment would soon be no match for computers, IBM invested heavily to build its first mainframe system in 1964. IBM sells mainframes to this day. In the early 1990s, the company was forced to transform itself once again, after its business nearly collapsed. The software and services model was adopted, and IBM grew into a global powerhouse offering integrated solutions. Today, IBM is undergoing yet another transformation, this time to a cloud and cognitive-computing company. The changes have been painful, but IBM's history of reinventing itself is a good reason to believe that the company can succeed. 2. Making hard choices IBM has never been shy about getting rid of businesses that no longer provide adequate returns. The company was once the leading seller of PCs, but it sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2004. This move reduced revenue, but the revenue was extremely low margin. Jumping ahead to today, with the PC market in a prolonged slump, IBM's move away from PCs looks prescient. In 2014, IBM sold its x86 server business, also to Lenovo. This move also reduced IBM's revenue, but the company recognized that it could gain no advantage selling hardware consisting of commodity parts. IBM has been shifting toward higher-value products and services for years, and its constant optimization of its portfolio of businesses is a trait few companies can match. 3. A sticky customer base IBM's push to offer integrated solutions involving hardware, software, and services has created significant switching costs for its customers. Approximately 80% of IBM's clients have deployed multiple IBM solutions, making the task of moving away from IBM more difficult. The list of IBM clients is impressive. According to IBM's 2015 investor briefing, 90 of the top 100 global banks, nine of the top 10 oil and gas companies, 92 of the top 100 healthcare organizations, and 80% of the top 50 retailers rely on IBM solutions. This broad customer base gives IBM the ability to maintain impressive profitability even as it completely transforms its business. Image source: IBM. 4. A surging cloud business At the end of the third quarter of this year, IBM's cloud computing business had produced $12.7 billion of revenue over the past 12 months. IBM's as-a-service cloud annual revenue run rate, which includes infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service, reached $7.5 billion, up 66% year over year. IBM is far from the largest cloud infrastructure provider, and it will probably never be as big as Amazon.com's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. But IBM's cloud strategy is to offer high-value, differentiated solutions, such as analytics and security. The business of renting commodity computing resources, while an important part of IBM's cloud business, is not the main focus. 5. Making smart bets IBM has largely avoided the kinds of large, transformative acquisitions tech giants make that rarely turn out well. Instead, IBM generally buys up smaller companies to build out its product offerings. Between 2011 and 2015, IBM spent $13 billion on acquisitions, along with $48 billion on research and development and capital expenditures. Recent acquisitions include Promontory Financial Group, a financial consulting firm; EZSource, an application discovery company; and Bluewolf Group, a cloud consulting provider. None of these acquisitions is a game changer on its own, but they collectively represent IBM's attempt to broaden its portfolio and capabilities. IBM's ability to avoid making disastrous acquisitions as many of its peers have is a real asset. 6. Watson The face of IBM's transformation is Watson, the company's cognitive-computing system. Watson is expected to eventually become a major business, and IBM has been entering partnerships for the past few years in an effort to push Watson into a broad array of industries. The company expects 1 billion people to use Watson in some form by the end of next year, a milestone that suggests that Watson is gaining traction. Recently, General Motors announced that it will use Watson in a new version of its OnStar system to provide personalized offers. The recently acquired Promontory Financial Group will also use Watson to help clients reduce spending on compliance. Slack, an enterprise messaging start-up, plans to use Watson to improve its customer-service bot. The list goes on and on. Watson may not yet contribute much revenue for IBM, but the future looks bright. 7. The healthcare moonshot One area where Watson is actively being used is the healthcare industry. Through various partnerships with healthcare organizations, Watson is helping doctors provide better diagnoses and treatment options. The system can churn through an immense amount of data, including medical records, journal articles, and books, giving doctors the information they need to make better decisions. Earlier this month, IBM and Quest Diagnostics expanded a partnership that will see Watson more broadly available to consume genomic information from tissue samples and provide better treatments for cancer patients. The global healthcare industry is immense, and IBM's aggressive push to apply Watson to a broad set of healthcare problems could pay dividends down the road. Image source: IBM. 8. OpenPOWER Intel currently dominates the market for server chips, enjoying a near monopoly and abundant profit margins. IBM, through the OpenPOWER foundation, aims to chip away at Intel's lead by teaming with a broad set of companies to build an ecosystem around its Power chips. The OpenPOWER foundation includes giants such as Alphabet's Google, NVIDIA, Micron, and Samsung, as well as more than 100 other member companies. The process of reclaiming meaningful market share from Intel has been slow, but some good news emerged earlier this year. Google is developing an open server architecture based on IBM's upcoming POWER9 processors, a move that could see the company, as well as other cloud computing providers, move away from being 100% Intel. That's good news for IBM's Power business. 9. A solid dividend IBM has paid a quarterly dividend without fail since 1916, and it's raised that dividend for 21 years in a row. The most recent quarterly dividend payment, $1.40 per share, puts the stock's dividend yield at roughly 3.7%. IBM's payout ratio, based on its guidance for non-GAAP EPS this year, is just 41%, meaning that the company has room to grow the dividend faster than it grows earnings. Expecting continued high-single-digit dividend growth going forward seems realistic, and it makes IBM a stock to buy and hold. 10. An attractive valuation IBM expects to produce $13.50 in per-share adjusted earnings this year, which puts the P/E ratio at about 11.4. Earnings have been in decline, but the company's transformation is making progress. Strategic imperatives now account for 40% of revenue and are still growing at a double-digit rate, and the company appears tantalizingly close to turning the corner. The market is pricing IBM at a pessimistic valuation, with the assumption that the company won't be able to return to robust earnings growth. Given IBM's history, I wouldn't underestimate Big Blue.

I’ve blogged on it and a good summary of lots of opinions about the topic can be found here: http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/. This post is more of an introspective piece about me, so fair warning. I’m what you’d probably call a mid-time Mac user. I used Macs growing up in school and learned my first “real” programming language on one during school (Pascal). However, I didn’t actually start owning Macs until the Intel transition. At the time, I was fairly deep in the Windows platform. My first computer that I had purchased (my actual first computer was a Packard Bell, 486 25MHz machine) with my own money was one of the first convertible laptops that Microsoft helped usher out: the Toshiba Protégé 3500. ￼￼ Mind you, this was like back in 2003. Pen computing was new (at least in the consumer space), and it was going to be huge. Well… or so I thought. Turns out, the novelty wore off pretty quickly. The hardware and the software just wasn’t very compelling. The truth is, even over the years, there’s not been a single Windows PC that has ink that really felt much different than that Toshiba. I had been eyeing the Mac for some time. I’d even used one of the old white plastic iBooks that a friend lent to me to help on a project. I was pretty turned off because I thought the hype of Mac OS was supposed to be better than this! It turns out, those iBooks were just pretty terrible machines. Their touch pads sucked and they were missing a bunch of the features that their bigger brothers, the PowerBook had. Now, I wanted a PowerBook, but I simply wasn’t able to give up running Windows. Also, as a freshly out-of-college graduate, I certainly didn’t have the money to buy both a PC and a Mac, even though I did just land a job at Microsoft (which I still work at today, for full disclosure). It turns out living in Kirkland is pretty expensive. And then the announcement: I was sold. Done. Over the next 12-18 months, I would transition over to Mac OS X for all of my home use. Eventually, the Windows Boot Camp partition would be gone. It’s hard to explain exactly, but there was just something so refreshing and so emotionally engaging about OS X. I know that doesn’t exist for everyone, but for me, it was a huge pull. It’s why I still use a Mac today. It’s why even after using Win 10 with all its improvements (and sadly the only real vessel for playing games), switching back to my Mac just feels like home. Over the years I’ve got to see the Mac flourish, OS X make great improvements, the iPhone, and the iPad. It was a really great time to be an Apple enthusiast. It seems like every product that came out was, “YES, I WANT! DONE!”. And then the “big” iPhones starting coming out. And then the WATCH came out. It’s kind of ironic as this was near the end of the time that Apple was making fun of fragmentation in the Android market, and well, here we are with fragmentation of a different sort now: form factors and platform variations. But for me, this was also the first time since 2006 in which I didn’t want to buy what Apple was creating. Side Note: I have an WATCH series 2 now, and my quick review would be: it’s ok. I set my expectations low going in as I only wanted it as a watch and a fitness tracker. It has reminded me how much I miss wearing a watch though.  No big deal right? More consumers in the space now, more needs and compromises to be made. Yeah? Maybe. But the cracks were already showing with each software update adding new features and not fixing bugs – some of which that have been around for years now, like the incomplete progress bar – ok, an exaggeration, they were fixing some of the bugs. But there was a lot of stuff that was just not working well or at all (Maps, iCloud, and MUSIC as examples). Sure, some of this has gotten better, but some not, and some has just changed to a new kind of pain. Then we got the PENCIL. I went to the Apple store to use one, it felt great! Remember that Protégé from above? Nothing like that. This was smooth, almost no latency, awesome. I have an iPad Pro. How often do I use the PENCIL? Honestly cannot tell you the last time. Frankly, how much do I use my iPad Pro? Remember all those Apple jokes about a giant phone app on an Android tablet? Yeah… say hello to iPad apps on an iPad Pro. We also got Swift. The “Objective-C without the C” language. Now Swift has a lot of nice features in it, but it’s a pain to use right now. The tooling (namely Xcode and the debugger) is really terrible, it’s extremely unstable from version to version. It has huge discrepancies between optimized and non-optimized builds in terms for performance, and in some cases, functionality (though I think nearly all of those are fixed now). I could go on, but the point is, Swift is not really the language for me at the moment (nor is necessarily the direction I’d hoped for, but maybe I’ll reflect on that more later). That will definitely change when things settle down, but it’s not there yet, including some of its broader cross-platform implications. But, like I’ve said, I’m in desperate need of a new dev machine, but: Luckily there is the event, “hello again”, right? Let’s start with TV. Besides the obvious “TV in a TV” jokes because of the questionably lazy design of the app icon… wasn’t is just last year that Cook said, “We believe the future of TV is apps”? And now, you’re going to shove all of this “content” into a single location… well, not all of it as TV is still missing Amazon Prime and the new app doesn’t include Netflix. This covers the rest better than I care too: http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html. And of course, the MacBook Pro, or the MBPTB (MacBook Pro with Touch Bar) edition. You know, I’m torn on this. The Touch Bar seems gimmicky. It also seems like it’s something that is just really not that usable in the same way that the tactile functions keys are (which I do use). I can also see how much of the entire demo that was featured could be done in the UI as well, and in many cases, just as well, if not better. But besides the touch bar, the performance updates just look, well, rather lackluster? The questions come up: Why not the Nvidia 1060 and 1080 chips? Why not sacrifice some thinness gains for more power or more battery life? Why not the 7th generation Intel chips? Why not more than 16GB of RAM? Why not …? After reflecting about it some more, I think the answer is simply: because Apple can. Every update to the MacBook and MacBook Pro have been wrought with various trade-offs. Sometimes we mock the choices, but even in my poking, I’m glad there is a company that is trying to push just how thin can we get a computing device. I don’t think Apple is willing to stop until it’s paper thin. Sometimes it’s really disheartening looking out at the PC landscape of hardware and seeing all of these options that make different sets of trade-offs. Maybe those trade-offs align with more of what I’d like personally, which make it even more troublesome. Do I really want to buy a new PC? Is that where I want to move to? I mean, I play games on a PC, but I’m reserved to that fact already that Mac has just lost the battle there as is unable to recoup. Now, the MacBook Pro is not everything I want in a laptop. It is most certainly not everything that I want in a desktop computer. But, when the dust settles, it’s still a Mac. With all of the warts that macOS has, with all of the mind boggling decisions that Apple makes with some of their products at time, is there really any other platform I’d rather be using? No. The answer is that I do not want to. Even with many things at Apple seemingly going a direction that I might not like, I still have hope that Apple can start to tighten the reins in (if the rumors of project Titan being cancelled or scaled way back are true, I think that may be a good indication that some retraction is indeed starting). And who knows… maybe the Mac Pro will get updated in March. Maybe Apple is on a three year cycle with it because it thinks that’s roughly the upgrade cycle of desktop Mac users. I don’t know… but I do know that I cannot risk waiting until then only to be potentially severely disappointed by a lack of announcement. But, if this it the slow, twisted demise of macOS, then I guess I’m going to ride it down to the ground. Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like Loading...

Yesterday, that came to fruition. Qualcomm entered an agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors for an estimated $39 billion on Thursday morning, a deal that will create the world’s third largest pure semiconductor company behind Intel and Samsung with projected annual revenues of more than $30 billion. The purchase nets Qualcomm market-leading positions in the fields of wireless, processing, and security, and also provides the company with an opportunity to diversify its portfolio as the consumer smartphone/mobile market continues to plateau – according to a letter from Rick Clemmer, CEO of NXP Semiconductors this morning, the combined company will be able to offer scalable solutions for automotive, networking, and, of course, the Internet of Things (IoT). While Qualcomm has had a strong footprint in connectivity and communications systems, NXP brings general-purpose compute, applications processors, and additional RF technology to bear for attacking the IoT market, while the company’s automotive-grade processing and sensor offerings will further enable Qualcomm to deliver more complete advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), infotainment, and autonomous drive vehicle solutions. In addition, NXP’s secure authentication portfolio applies to nearly every vertical deploying connected systems. The cost of doing business Given the magnitude of the acquisition, which is the largest deal ever in the semiconductor industry, the transaction isn’t expected to complete until the end of the 2017 calendar year. Until then, Clemmer wrote, “it will be business as usual” for NXP employees, a conventional response in such situations. However, the implications of the combined Qualcomm/NXP are much farther reaching. On the engineering side, the vestiges of Freescale’s tradition of research and development coupled with the aggressive technological innovation of Qualcomm (see the patent wall in Qualcomm’s headquarters) will hopefully create a culture of advancement that serves industry well. Given the engineering talent Qualcomm has amassed and the increased access to technology, tools, and resources from across the two organizations now at their disposal, the likelihood of market-altering products on the order of the i.MX, Snapdragon, and Power architectures would appear to be trending upwards. In this regard, at least, bigger is certainly better. From a business perspective, the acquisition of NXP actually opens up an old can of worms for Qualcomm. As you may or may not know, about a year ago Qualcomm heavily considered spinning off its patent licensing from its chipmaking business, but decided against it after an extensive internal strategic review. The reasons for the potential split were largely financial, as stagnant revenues prompted shareholder interest in creating a separate organization of Qualcomm Licensing Technologies (QTL) – which accounts for 31 percent of the company’s total revenue but 74 percent of its operational income; Qualcomm’s chip business, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), accounted for the reverse (67 percent total revenue and 26 percent of operational income). While initially staggering, those numbers are to be expected when one considers the cost of doing business in the semiconductor industry. However, adding NXP’s broad portfolio of semiconductor solutions that currently ranges from low-power microcontrollers (MCUs) to sensors to power management may bolster the QCT portfolio enough to warrant a standalone entity, providing each division of Qualcomm’s business with the agility to be successful moving forward. Of course, only time will tell as Qualcomm/NXP begin down the long road of integration. As they say in M&A, it typically takes six months just for a buyer to figure out what they’ve bought.   Topics covered in this article Internet of Things Processing automotive wireless nxp IoT Advertisement Embedded Computing Design Articles White Papers Products News Blogs 5-Minute Interviews Part Search © MMXVI Embedded Computing Design An OpenSystems Media publication.

Austin, TX (PRWEB) October 31, 2016 Leading global sales training provider Imparta announces today the release of the Virtual Sales Academy™. The Virtual Sales Academy is an immersive, cloud-based, experiential technology platform that replicates a full sales academy in a digital form, allowing salespeople and managers to learn, refine and apply the skills that are central to success. The Academy reimagines the delivery of sales training, and significantly raises the bar for online sales training. The Academy was originally designed in collaboration with Cisco for their Global Virtual Sales & Customer Success Organization. “Face-to-face training is expensive and does not always engage a largely millennial salesforce, yet traditional e-learning fails to build real-world skills,” said Richard Barkey, the founder and CEO of Imparta. “We’ve reimagined sales training by taking the best of what we know works in the traditional sales training world: the skill building, the assessments, the importance of manager interaction and coaching, and the play on the natural competitive instincts of salespeople. We’ve combined all that with the advantages digital learning offers: 24/7 learning, experiential scenarios and simulations, gamification and online social interactions. We have been determined to give learners the best possible experience.” The Curriculum At the heart of the Virtual Sales Academy is the concept of customer-centricity. This concept is central to Imparta’s proven Creating Client Value sales methodology, as deployed by many leading sales organizations, including GE, Intel, Cisco and Telefonica. Participants learn how to build their position as a trusted advisor to their clients, bringing insights that drive new opportunities. They hone their ability to understand and influence the customer’s decision process in order to add value to it, but also to make sure that they maximize their win rate and the return on their invested time. The Virtual Sales Academy curriculum also includes modules around interpersonal skills and negotiation, and an option to cover the organization’s core products and services. The curriculum can be customized as required, and also adapts itself to the strengths and weaknesses of each participant.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte builds Brix on Apollo Lake SoCs by Zak Killian  10:00 AM on October 31, 2016 Just a few weeks after refreshing the Brix lineup with Kaby Lake CPUs, Gigabyte is launching a couple of Brix mini-PCs based on Intel's Apollo Lake SoCs. The awkwardly-named GB-BPCE-3455 and GB-BPCE-3350 are minuscule black boxes packed with the latest low-power silicon from Santa Clara. The GB-BPCE-3455 uses the quad-core Celeron J3455, while the GB-BPCE-3350 comes with a dual-core Celeron N3350 SoC. The machines are otherwise identical. Don't be fooled by that picture. The new machines are much smaller than the Brix Pro and Brix Gaming mini-PCs we've reviewed. In fact, they're even smaller than the last Brix mini-PCs we looked at earlier in the month, at only 2.2" x 4.2" x 4.5" (or 5.6 cm x 10.7 cm x 11.4 cm). Recent Brix models have a somewhat flat form factor, but the new models have a boxy shape since they include a 2.5" drive bay, despite their diminutive dimensions. That drive bay hooks up to a SATA 6Gbps port and can take in drives up to 9.5 mm tall. Put the biggest disk you can afford in that slot. Apart from dual DDR3L SO-DIMM slots and MicroSD card reader, that's all the expansion you get with the baby Brixes. There's an M.2 slot, but it's occupied by an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi card with Bluetooth. Given the 10W-or-less nature of the SoCs inside the new Brixes, we'd expect them to be fanless. Update: Alan from Gigabyte tells us that the quad-core 3455 model has a fan, while the dual-core 3350 model is fanless. Displays can be connected to Gigabyte's new ultra-compact PCs via a HDMI 2.0 output and a side-firing VGA port. Both ports can be used simultaneously, and Gigabyte says the little Brixes can output 4096x2160 video at 60Hz from the HDMI connector. Realtek chips power the Gigabit Ethernet and analog audio jacks. These machines get four USB 3.0 ports—more than some laptops we could name—and a regular old 3.5mm headphone jack, too.

October 31 AAPL: 113.54 -0.18 MacBook Pro Diary: My take on some of the criticisms being levelled at the new models Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro MacBook Pro Diary View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The new MacBook Pro models have been coming under a fair amount of criticism on the Internet. Many are saying that the new machines just aren’t wowing them, especially just after Microsoft demonstrated that it is still possible to do so even in the boring old desktop PC market with the new Surface Studio. That criticism is absolutely fair enough, and echoes my own views when I said that I was buying it despite not being excited by it. But some criticisms being directed at the machines seem to me to be misplaced … Many have been saying that Apple has launched a brand new model with a year-old CPU. That one isn’t fair: right now, Skylake is the latest processor available in i7 quad-core form. The Kaby Lake version won’t be available until December if Intel delivers it on time, which is never a certainty. Microsoft, it should be noted, did exactly the same thing in sticking to Skylake in its shiny new computer. Sure, Apple could have waited, but there are a couple of downsides to that. First, it would have further delayed an update to a machine we were all complaining was now four years old. Second, Kaby Lake isn’t going to be a massive improvement over Skylake – it’s very much a second ‘tock’ update – so it would have been a further delay for limited benefit. And it wouldn’t – as some are suggesting – simply have been a one-month delay, from November to December. Once the new chips are available, Apple would need to do a lot of testing before they were ready for release. As Gizmodo noted: While Samsung wasn’t mentioned, the horror show that’s been the Note 7’s launch and subsequent recall can’t be ignored in this context. The now famous screw up involved a huge company that reportedly rushed a product to market, only to see it literally blow up in its customers’ faces. Second, there has been a lot of grumbling over the maximum 16GB RAM, even in maxed-out build-to-order machines. Phil Schiller says that’s for reasons of power efficiency. Should we take his word for it? Well, I can say one thing: Apple doesn’t usually like to leave money on the table. Historically, it has charged quite a steep premium for RAM upgrades, so if it isn’t even offering 32GB as an expensive option, there is likely a very good reason for that. To me, there’s no reason to doubt the one Schiller has given. Then there’s ports. Here I’ve heard both more and less reasonable comments. Engadget, for example, said this: Sadly, your fancy new iPhone 7 won’t directly connect to your new MacBook Pro. Think about that for a second. Two flagship devices from a company that prides itself on its ecosystem won’t connect to each other without a special converter. But that’s not exactly true. You do have to buy a new cable, yes, but you don’t need any clunky adapters. Now, if you want to instead argue that Apple should have included both USB-A and USB-C cables in the iPhone 7 box, I’ll agree entirely. It was silly to launch a new iPhone one month and a new Mac the following month and not supply a cable that would connect one to the other. But let’s not talk about dongles here. And most iPhone owners won’t even need that, as they probably never connect their iPhone to their Mac anyway. Most people use iCloud backup. A bigger complaint is the complete loss of all USB-A ports. Some have been saying that Apple should at least have included a mixture of old and new ports, but I disagree. Here’s what I said before: You could argue that a mix of ports would be useful, but that would be true for maybe the first year of ownership. After that, we’d be moaning about the fact that we have only two USB-C ports because there’s space taken up with those huge, ugly, old-fashioned USB-A ones. I think Apple made the right call here. It’s trading off a slight inconvenience now against spending most of the machine’s life (4-5 years for me) with two completely redundant ports. So I still say Apple got this right. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 There was this amusing tweet about the 17 different dongles Apple now sells, with one piece suggesting that the new machine required users to buy $250 worth of dongles. This is, of course, pure clickbait. The reality for most users is that they’ll need one or two at most. I haven’t ever seen any stats, but my guess would be that the vast majority of MacBook owners never connect anything other than power to their machine. For those that do, mostly it will be just one or two USB devices, like a USB key and external drive. That requires exactly one dongle: a USB-A to USB-C adapter that costs $22 if you buy an Apple one or about $8 for a third-party one. Or, if it’s just a USB key, a $19 dual USB-A/USB-C one will allow connection to both old and new computers. Now, we’re techies, and we connect lots of things to our Macs, but even so, what I needed personally was exactly three adapters or cables: one each for USB-A, Thunderbolt 2 and Lightning. Most of my existing USB-A devices are connected through my monitor, so a single adapter is all I need for things like external drives. (Admittedly, things will get messier if I upgrade my monitor as well to one with USB-C ports, but that’s a separate issue.) I do agree with one port criticism: the loss of MagSafe. I’d really like to have retained this, so will be trying the Griffin Breaksafe which Chance reviewed to see whether that does the job. Which brings us to price … So far in our poll, this is the number one reason people aren’t buying the new models. The new machines are undoubtedly very expensive, but some have been suggesting that Apple has repositioned itself from a premium to a luxury brand where MacBooks are concerned. I don’t think that’s the case at all. We currently have $999 as the entry-point, for the 13-inch MacBook Air, just $100 up on the previous entry-level. That machine probably meets the needs of 95% of Mac owners, who use it for web, email, basic photo editing and maybe writing that novel. If you value sleekness enough, you can instead pay $1299 for a less powerful but sexier machine. The minority who need power can start at $1499 and go up to, well, the level I did. Bottom-line: there’s still something for everyone who was ever in Apple’s price-range at all. As for the shiny new MacBook Pro models, they are extremely expensive today, but I’d expect the price to fall in time. If you look at the precedent set by the 27-inch 5K iMac, it launched two years ago at a starting price of $2499. Apple’s current pricing starts at just $1799 (and you can get it for a bit less on Amazon and elsewhere). Now, the spec is different, but basically they launched the best machine they could at a high price, then a slightly more modest one at a much more affordable price. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the same thing happen here with MacBooks just as it has in the past. So sure, views vary, and it’s absolutely fine to criticize the new machines. But I think we do need to recognize that some of the criticisms being levelled at Apple over the new machines are, at the very least, over-blown.

After weeks of insisting that only Apple could help the feds unlock the phone of San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook, the Justice Department suddenly revealed that a third party had provided a way to get into the device. Speculation swirled around the identity of that party until an Israeli newspaper reported it was Cellebrite.  It turns out the company was not the third party that helped the FBI. A Cellebrite representative said as much during a panel discussion at a high-tech crimes conference in Minnesota this past April, according to a conference attendee who spoke with The Intercept. And sources who spoke with the Washington Post earlier this year also ruled out Cellebrite’s involvement, though Yossi Carmil, one of Cellebrite’s CEOs, declined to comment on the matter when asked by The Intercept. But the attention around the false report obscured a bigger, more interesting truth: Cellebrite’s researchers have become, over the last decade, the FBI’s go-to hackers for mobile forensics. Many other federal agencies also rely on the company’s expertise to get into mobile devices. Cellebrite has contracts with the FBI going back to 2009, according to federal procurement records, but also with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and DHS’s Customs and Border Protection. U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies use Cellebrite’s researchers and tools as well, as does the U.S. military, to extract data from phones seized from suspected terrorists and others in battle zones. The company is poised to seize a prominent and somewhat ominous place in the public imagination; just as Apple has come to be seen as a warrior for digital protection and privacy against overreaching government surveillance, Cellebrite is emerging as its law-and-order counterpart, endeavoring to build tools to break through the barriers Apple and other phone makers erect to protect data. “Vendors … are implementing more and more security features into their product, and that’s definitely challenging for us,” says  Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. “But we’ve solved these challenges before [and] we continue to solve these challenges today.” In July, months after the unknown third party provided the FBI with a method for getting into the San Bernardino phone — an iPhone 5C running iOS 9 — Cellebrite announced that it had developed its own technique for bypassing the phone’s password/encryption lock. And the company is confident that it will be able to deal successfully with future security changes Apple may make to its phones in the wake of the San Bernardino case. “If it’s going to be done, it’s going to be done in this building,” Carmil told The Intercept during a visit to the company’s Israeli headquarters earlier this year. Cellebrite’s ascent comes at a time when mobile forensics has never been more important to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Data extracted from phones has eclipsed data extracted from desktop and laptop computers in recent years, since the former can yield not only detailed logs about a user’s activities, interests, and communications, but also, in many cases, map the user’s whereabouts over weeks and months to produce a pattern of life.  The story of Cellebrite’s emergence as a forensic powerhouse is the story of how mobile forensics itself has evolved over the years — beginning first in the late ’90s with a simple tool for migrating user contacts from one cellphone to another, which morphed in 2007 to a solution for harvesting address book data from PDAs and feature phones, to the complex multistage operations needed today to bypass the sophisticated security mechanisms built in to smartphones. Ahead of Competitors Cellebrite isn’t the only forensic game in town. It has a number of rivals around the world, each with varying strengths and weaknesses. They include the Swedish firm MicroSystemation AB, also known as MSAB, whose XRY tool is used by the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military and others; the U.S. firms Susteen, Paraben, and BlackBag Technologies; Magnet Forensics, a Canadian firm; and Oxygen Forensics, a Russian firm whose customers include, according to its website, the IRS, U.S. Army, DOD, DHS, and the Justice Department. But Robert Osgood, an FBI supervisory agent for more than 25 years until he retired from the bureau in 2011, says that Cellebrite and MSAB are the leaders. “They’re the two 800-pound gorillas in the mobile forensic device world” when it comes to extracting data, says Osgood, who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University. “I would be lying to say it is still close — because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition.” —Heather Mahalik, advanced mobile forensics trainer, SANS Institute. Although he says the FBI buys other forensic tools, they are primarily used in specific niches — for example, parsing and analyzing subsets of data, such as data associated with social networking apps, after it has already been extracted using a Cellebrite or MSAB tool. Heather Mahalik, who trains about 400 federal and local law enforcement workers a year in advanced mobile forensics for the SANS Institute, says that even among these two giants, Cellebrite has been edging out its competitor over the last two years. “There are uniqueness and little tricks in both of them that really help … but I would be lying to say it is still close [between them], because I know that Cellebrite works better for acquisition,” she told The Intercept. Mahalik says she surveys her students each year to see which tools they’re using on the job. Two years ago, Cellebrite and MSAB were almost neck and neck, but these days, she says her students mention only Cellebrite. A 2012 annual report from MSAB acknowledges that Cellebrite penetrated the U.S. market before it did, which helped it gain an advantage as a result. Cellebrite’s forensic tools include the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), hardware bundled with proprietary software that acquires, decodes, and analyzes data from smartphones, tablets, and portable GPS devices; the UFED4PC, which is standalone software for use on a PC; and the UFED Pro, an add-on to the UFED that does something called physical extraction, which siphons data directly from a phone’s flash memory chip. This can include deleted SMS messages and call histories as well as data collected by the phone and apps that the user is unaware is being collected. The company doesn’t help governments remotely hack into phones for real-time surveillance, as the NSO Group, another Israeli firm, reportedly does; Cellebrite focuses only on forensics — collecting data and artifacts already created and stored on phones. Physical access to the phone is required for their work. Cellebrite’s edge lies in its ability to extract data from more mobile operating systems and chips than its competitors, often producing solutions faster than rivals. Each time a new version of a mobile phone or an update to an existing operating system is released, Cellebrite’s team of reverse engineers goes into assault mode to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other hidden pathways that will give the engineers access to data the phone makers have worked hard to block. In some cases, they’re already working on new phones before they’re released. That’s because some vendors — Cellebrite won’t say which ones, but Apple isn’t among them — ship a sample of their new phones to Cellebrite three months before they’re released, giving Cellebrite engineers a head start in cracking the devices. It’s a practice that dates back to the company’s original business, selling gear to cellular carriers that helped their customers migrate contacts from one phone to another.  The company doesn’t put all of its forensic techniques into its automated tools, however. To prevent competitors from reverse-engineering its software to uncover and steal its unique methods and to prevent phone vendors from discovering the vulnerabilities used in its techniques and patching them, some exploits are only performed manually by its staff. Its new solution for extracting data from iPhone 5C’s running iOS 9 — the San Bernardino phone — can only be performed by a Cellebrite worker as part of the company’s Advanced Investigative Services division, also known as CAIS. This is a premium unlocking subscription service that costs $250,000 a year in the U.S., according to a DEA procurement record, and will also get customers help in bypassing encryption on the iPhone 4S and 5, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5, and some Galaxy S7s, among other devices. Though Cellebrite will also unlock phones as a one-off service, for about $1,500 per phone. Bypassing encryption, the most vexing problem law enforcement faces today in mobile forensics, is one of Cellebrite’s biggest selling points. The company says it has been able to “crack the code to the screen locks” on a number of phone models, allowing it to access data on the phones without a password. “Encryption is a show stopper for most of the industry,” Tal told The Intercept. “Except for us.” Technology used to extract data from mobile phones, developed by Cellebrite, is pictured at an international forensic laboratory in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 22, 2013. Photo: Colm O'Molloy/Boston Globe/Getty Images How It Began Cellebrite employs about 520 people, most in Israel, including workers at a manufacturing facility in the southern part of the country that makes its UFED devices. The company is a subsidiary of the Japanese Sun Corporation, which took ownership of 80 percent of the firm in 2007. And although Sun doesn’t influence the company’s strategy or direction, Carmil says, its secretive corporate culture appears to have affected Cellebrite’s approach with the media. “We are not telling so much about ourselves. What we tell is what Sun has allowed us to publish,” Carmil told The Intercept. Cellebrite’s headquarters in Israel occupies several floors of a mid-sized office tower in Petach Tikva, a small city east of Tel Aviv that was once a malarial swamp until Jewish pioneers drained it in the 19th century to make way for citrus groves. The groves have largely been replaced today with hi-tech business parks like the one Cellebrite shares with IBM and Intel. Its modern office space was dim and quiet during an afternoon visit by The Intercept in June, except for the sound of Hebrew rock playing softly on a floor where researchers worked. Down a hallway leading to the research offices was a device lab resembling a large, highly organized shoe closet that contained more than 15,000 mobile handsets stored in carefully marked boxes. These are phones that Cellebrite has bought or received in advance from vendors over the years to analyze.  About 200 new phones arrive to the lab monthly, each containing different versions of operating systems and configurations, since carriers like Verizon and AT&T like to customize the branded phones they offer customers by tweaking the operating system to disable and enable different features. There are also burner phones – pre-paid throwaway phones that criminals and terrorists often favor because they offer anonymity – and phones from China that pose a special challenge to extracting data because they often lack uniformity and standardization in their design. Each phone that arrives to the lab gets a manual inspection to determine the software that’s running on it and any operating system changes the vendor has made since previous versions. A screen outside the device lab in Cellebrite’s office shows the system for tracking devices that have been assigned to researchers. Photo: Kim Zetter for The Intercept Cellebrite has five forensic research teams: the team that reverse-engineers phones to find zero-day vulnerabilities and other means of extracting data; a team that focuses on translating binary data into a readable format; a cloud data team; and two teams who work on analytics, which involves mining data to create leads from different sources of data — for example, to cross-reference data extracted from a phone to determine all the locations a suspect has been in the past month. The analytics team is also working on being able to automatically identify activity in video extracted from mobile devices — an act of violence, for example. The reverse-engineer team that Tal leads, which is responsible for finding ways into phones, has about two dozen people. “I don’t know what the NSA has for mobile research, but in the forensics industry I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have,” says Tal, who joined the company late last year after leading the vulnerability research team at the Israeli security firm Checkpoint.  All of this belongs to Cellebrite’s new life as a mobile forensics firm. But the company didn’t begin life in forensics. “In the forensics industry, I’ve not been made aware of any sizable research team like we have.” —Shahar Tal, director of research at Cellebrite. Cellebrite launched in December 1999 with a tool that was only designed to transfer the contents of an address book from one phone to another. Back then, transferring contacts was a time-consuming task that was generally done manually. But Cellebrite developed the Universal Memory Exchange, a handheld device that resembled the clunky credit card readers airline stewards use to charge for in-flight beers, which could transfer data between any two phones, regardless of make and model. They later added capabilities for backing up, restoring, and synchronizing data as well. They sold the device initially only to telecoms and phone stores — first in Israel and Europe, then in the U.S. By 2005 Cellebrite says the UME was in more than half of all Verizon and T-Mobile phone shops in the U.S, in addition to the phone departments of big-box chains like Best Buy and Wal-Mart, something The Intercept was unable to confirm. “Every place that offers cellular-handset selling, repair, and exchange activity, Cellebrite was there,” Carmil asserts.  The UME became so integral to the mobile phone business that any time a vendor launched a new phone, it shipped an advance sample to Cellebrite to ensure that the UME would work with it. “Because we got all of [the phones] from the mobile operators … no one could compete with our phone support offering for a long time,” says Carmil, who was vice president of Siemens’s commercial division in Israel before joining Cellebrite. “We came with 1,500 [phones] supported, where the competition … were struggling for 100 or 150.” Cellebrite touts this advance look at phones as one reason for its competitive advantage in forensics. Though MSAB and Paraben, which don’t receive advance phones, naturally downplay early research like this, saying it can be counterproductive. “Many of the times the device firmware will change so much before the release that a lot of the deep research required for forensics must be redone [if done in advance of a device’s release],” Amber Schroader, CEO of Paraben, told The Intercept. By 2006, Cellebrite was selling its UME devices to law enforcement and security forces in Israel and abroad. It was at this point that the company’s new customers developed a novel use for the UME that caught Cellebrite’s attention — they were using it to extract call logs and other data from phones seized in criminal investigations. The method worked well for generating investigative leads, but the extracted data wasn’t forensically sound to serve as evidence in court. So the customers, Cellebrite won’t say which ones, asked for a way to show courts that data hadn’t been altered after it was removed from a phone. Cellebrite only had 18 employees at the time, but Carmil and co-CEO Ron Serber immediately saw the potential in steering the company in a new direction. “We realized that there is a market [for mobile forensics] which is already existing and established,” Carmil says. The next year, they released their first forensic tool, which was basically an extension of the software they were already using to transfer, back up, and restore data, but with a hash function thrown in to certify the integrity of extracted data. “That was the beauty of the whole story,” Carmil says. “We brought the same capabilities to a completely different core business.”  A hash is a cryptographic representation of data. Run text or data through a mathematical algorithm and you get a value that represents the data. But alter the data or text, and you get a different hash when run through the same algorithm. By comparing the hash of data on a phone with the hash of data presented in court, prosecutors could show it hadn’t been altered. It can also verify that the output from two different forensic tools grabbed the same data — if hashes of the two sets of extracted data are the same. Over time, as the number of mobile phones and data formats grew, Cellebrite added features for decoding varying formats and analyzing extracted data.  The company wasn’t the first to enter the mobile forensics field. Micro Systemation beat them to it with a mobile forensics tool in 2003; Paraben came out with a forensic tool for PDAs in 2001, followed in 2004 by a tool for mobile phones. But Cellebrite’s solution could process data from CDMA and TDMA phones, unlike competitors.  It was easy to extract data from mobile phones a decade ago, says Leeor Ben-Peretz, executive vice president for products and business development at Cellebrite. The devices had none of the sophisticated security protections they have today and there was a lot of public documentation that detailed programming interfaces, so researchers for the most part didn’t have to reverse-engineer operating systems and applications to understand how they worked. All of that changed in January 2007 when Apple introduced the iPhone, a smartphone that blended music, email, text messaging, web browsing, camera, and desktop applications with an easy-to-use touchscreen interface. The following year, Apple added GPS to the phone. It was a forensic bonanza for law enforcement, but Apple wasn’t generous with its documentation the way other phone makers had been. And as subsequent versions of the iPhone came out, Apple added security protections, including encryption, that made it even more difficult to extract data. Cellebrite scrambled to expand its research team. Carmil won’t say why — he’s silent on a lot of things about the company — but it seems to have coincided with the forensic challenges the iPhone brought. Cellebrite went looking for skilled reverse engineers, particularly among former members of the Israeli military’s Unit 8200, the famed tech and signals intelligence unit where many of the country’s elite hackers and vulnerability researchers hone their skills. Tal, Cellebrite’s 33-year-old director of research, hails from the unit. The research efforts paid off and the company’s forensic business soared, as shown by federal procurement records, particularly among U.S. law enforcement. Cellebrite has held about 230 federal contracts over the years, with the first dating to late 2007 when it signed contracts with the DEA, Secret Service, and the Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. The National Guard Bureau of Tennessee purchased six UFED devices in 2008, noting in its procurement document that the DEA already had “over 200” of them. On September 11, 2009, the FBI appears to have signed its first contract with Cellebrite. And by the end of that year, the company says more than 4,500 UFED devices were in use around the world.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images Something else was happening to push sales in the U.S., according to Christa Miller, Cellebrite’s former director of mobile forensics marketing from 2012 to 2015. Wireless carriers were storing customer text messages for only short periods of time, and law enforcement was desperate to find a way to get evidence from customer devices even after it vanished from telecom servers and after users deleted it from their phone, Miller says. So in November 2009, Cellebrite launched a new product, the UFED Physical Pro, to extract data from the flash memory chip of phones, including deleted data.  There are two primary ways to retrieve data from mobile phones — logical extraction and physical extraction. Logical focuses on content and data the phone allows you to extract naturally through its application programming interface, or API, such as contacts and text messages. Sometimes the method for extracting the data is well-documented, sometimes it’s not and requires reverse-engineering; but in general, the presence of the data is readily apparent to a user or piece of software. Physical extraction, by contrast, gets data from a phone’s flash chips that’s not normally available, like deleted information. In August 2010, Cellebrite developed the means to do physical extractions from iPhones on the market at the time. By 2012, the company was also able to extract deleted messages from BlackBerry and Motorola devices, the latter using a technique that bypassed the user lock.  And in 2014, Samsung’s Galaxy S4 family of devices fell to the company’s physical extraction methods as well. MSAB began offering its own physical extractions from flash memory in 2010. Cellebrite is secretive about its methods, but a lawsuit the company filed against MSAB in 2013, accusing its competitor of stealing its Samsung and BlackBerry techniques, offered a few clues about the company’s process. It asserted, in regard to Samsung devices, that the technique didn’t require the phones to be powered-down first to do the extraction and that the solution involved a vulnerability in the phone’s memory, or RAM. Cellebrite’s researchers also had to locate several “landing addresses” in the RAM where they could inject a custom bootloader they created. A bootloader is code built in to a smartphone that launches the phone’s operating system when someone turns on the device. But Cellebrite’s custom bootloader halts the normal boot process in a way that allows their tool to then access and read the phone’s memory. Cellebrite’s other solution, for the BlackBerry smartphone, relied on a vulnerability the company found in the process that BlackBerry phones used for authenticating BlackBerry software delivered from a desktop computer to the phones, which allowed them to load their bootloader to the phones. The Cellebrite bootloader, the company wrote in its lawsuit, piggybacked on the official signed BlackBerry bootloader, “thus tricking the extremely sophisticated BlackBerry security protocols” into allowing the Cellebrite bootloader to run on BlackBerry devices in place of the legitimate bootloader.  Methods like this for doing physical extractions, however, were soon thwarted by Apple and other vendors, who began to increase the security of their phones by encrypting data stored on the devices and adding other security protections. A physical extraction yields a greater wealth of information over a logical extraction, unless the data extracted is encrypted and therefore unreadable. The problem was particularly acute with iPhones. “Modern iPhones, if the user configures them correctly, are virtually impossible to get into,” says Osgood.  In June 2009, for example, Apple introduced full-disk encryption with iOS 3 and the iPhone 3GS (the term “full-disk encryption” has come to refer to routine encryption of all data stored on a device, even those, like the iPhone, that do not actually use a physical disk). It was the first stage in the Going Dark problem for law enforcement, though it was only a partial eclipse, since the encryption key was not user-generated but was generated from a unique ID embedded in the phone, which meant Apple still had the ability to unlock phones. With iOS4, Apple introduced a file-encryption scheme that used a key derived from the user’s password and the embedded ID. Apple also added a time delay of 80 milliseconds to password guesses, which made it harder, though not impossible, to bruteforce the user’s password. Then with iOS 8, Apple expanded the data it encrypted on the phone — photos, messages, contacts, call history — and added even more delay to password guesses. By the ninth failed password, the wait became an hour before another password could be tried. If the user enabled an erase feature, the decryption key would disappear altogether after 10 failed password attempts. Despite measures like these, Cellebrite has developed methods to get around or disable encryption in a number of phone models, including iPhones, though certainly not all of them. “If you can do it, the competitive barrier is huge,” says Ben-Peretz. “And this is where we excel.”  In June 2015, for example, Cellebrite developed a way to unlock Apple devices running iOS 8, without the risk of erasing the encryption key. Earlier this year, a forensic specialist in Italy, stymied by an iPhone 5 running iOS 8, reportedly paid $1,500 for a Cellebrite team to help get him into the phone. This doesn’t mean full-disk encryption isn’t still a challenge. Encryption is “definitely more complex than it was five years ago or 10 years ago,” Tal says. “There are more and more mechanisms involving encryption. … And today our typical forensic capability would be constructed out of several chains of blocks, each of which [is] solving a different technology layer or mechanism in order to provide the eventual result.” To defeat password locks and encryption, the company has developed custom bootloaders that in some cases can interrupt the boot process of the legitimate bootloader on a phone before the operating system loads and before the password-locking mechanism kicks in. The details of how it does this vary depending on the phone, says Tal. And the process for cracking an iPhone is much more complicated than this, though he won’t elaborate. A lawsuit Cellebrite filed last year against Oxygen Forensics touched on its solution for disabling the screenlock on some Samsung Android devices. According to a court document in the case, Cellebrite developed special lock disabler code — commands that can run on the phones, despite their screens being locked, and disable the locks. Cellebrite did something similar with LG Android phones, by identifying which files on the phone control the screen-locking function and manipulating them to disable the lock.

Photo: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Limits of Encryption Cracking Bollö, the MSAB CEO, admitted that encryption is hard for his company to address, though he told The Intercept, “we have solutions for either working around or trying to bypass” encryption. Asked to elaborate on those methods, however, he couldn’t provide a clear example.  “It is not as simple as getting around encryption or not,” he wrote in an email. He noted that these days, the problem isn’t just the extra security and encryption built in to phones themselves, but also the encryption in mobile apps. “I think both Google and Apple have more than 2 million apps on their app stores, and each app has their own database or encryption — they are updated 10 times as often [as phone operating systems],” he said during an interview in the company’s Virginia office. “That’s a much bigger challenge than specific phones.” Indeed, each forensic tool can only extract data from a small percentage of apps, so they focus on the most popular ones that are likely to yield important forensic data. The data for each app requires decoding if it’s in a special format. And once data is extracted, it has to be analyzed and presented in a format customers can understand. This is largely what makes mobile forensic tools so expensive — the many variations of phones, operating systems and applications they have to address. Mobile forensic tools can cost $10,000 to $14,000 for the base tool or software, with an additional annual subscription for upgrades — the release notes for new versions of Cellebrite’s tools and software list dozens of mobile apps and mobile handsets and operating systems that are newly supported by each upgrade. Tal says the breakthroughs they achieve in cracking phones are rewarding, but his research team gets other satisfaction from the work. “You see murderers, you see child molesters get behind bars because of data that we extracted yesterday, and it’s a very immediate connection with the purpose of what we’re doing here,” he says. “We’re not just security researchers who work on this forensic capability to make money for the company; there’s a story behind this for the people.” Cellebrite, he insists, gives highly skilled researchers a more ethical and acceptable outlet for their talents than, say, selling vulnerabilities and exploits to questionable buyers as some researchers do. He doesn’t name names, but researchers at the Citizen Lab in Canada recently found that Cellebrite’s compatriots at the NSO Group had supplied iPhone zero-days to the United Arab Emirates government to install a spy tool on a phone used by a local human rights activist. “[T]here are a lot of very good people, very good talents in this space who don’t necessarily feel very comfortable working for someone who may sell their product to a foreign government that may or may not use it against journalists in their countries and oppressive regimes,” Tal says.  He says their customers are first-world Western law enforcement agencies and notes that he’s had interest from a lot researchers lately who have been expressing an interest in working for Cellebrite “because they know the research we do doesn’t go into the ‘shady’ areas. We have a strong ethics backbone, a clear-use case for our capabilities, and dramatically less potential for abuse should ‘evil customers’ attempt to deceive us.” This doesn’t mean that Cellebrite is without controversy. The company works at the epicenter of an increasingly important U.S. policy debate about government use of computing vulnerabilities and exploits for surveillance purposes and about how keeping those vulnerabilities secret leaves the devices of millions of people vulnerable to intruders of all sorts. Apple still doesn’t know what iOS vulnerability the mystery party used to help the FBI hack into the San Bernardino phone, leaving many iPhone users at risk of someone else using the same vulnerability on their phones. Tal says Cellebrite’s researchers have deliberated at times about disclosing vulnerabilities they found to vendors, but won’t say if they’ve actually disclosed any. “Sometimes we do want to disclose a vulnerability because we think that’s in the best interest of our customers and in the best interest of maintaining some aspect of privacy and security,” he says. “But then of course [the] forensics business is entailed with getting access to information the vendor maybe did not want you to have access to. So there’s somewhat of a delicate dance around this.” Related Contact the author: Kim Zetter✉kkzetter@​gmail.comt@kimzetter Additional Credits: Additional Reporting: Jenna McLaughlin.˅ ⎕ 20 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

Lenovo Yoga Book. 1 2 Chris Griffith The Australian 12:00AM November 1, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Chris Griffith Technology reporter Sydney https://plus.google.com/116849779175391500455 @chris_griffith Within 100 years very few will be able to read the cursive handwriting we mastered in bygone centuries. It’s on the way out and very rarely do I use it now, except for signatures and writing Christmas card greetings. Soon you’ll need the services of a handwriting expert to decipher it. I don’t mean someone expert at identifying the writer, but expert at just working out what it says. This was in my mind when I began reviewing Lenovo’s tiny 2-in-1 Android Yoga Book. It’s so thin and light that in portrait mode it mimics the dimensions of a school notebook: just 26cm wide and 9mm thick, weighing 690 grams. It comes with Windows 10 or Android Marshmallow (6.0.1) installed. I chose to review the latter because it runs more efficiently with Intel’s lower power Atom x5-Z8550 Cherry Trail processor. Yoga Book is a curious mix of past and future. Open it, and you have an IPS full high definition display on the left, and a capacitive touch-sensitive area on the right where you draw, scribble and write cursive script with Lenovo’s stylus, provided in the box. Whatever you write is instantly replicated on the display to the left and you can save images of handwritten notes electronically. Further, you can take out the stylus tip out and replace it with an ink cartridge, and write on paper on the right and everything is replicated to the left. You end up with both physical and digital copies of screeds of notes. The Lenovo Yoga Book. When you’re not using the Yoga Book to take handwritten notes, you press a button and the blank digitised pad area lights up as a virtual keyboard. You can then use Yoga Book as a regular 2-in-1. It has a well-engineered watchband hinge that lets the screen rotate 360 degrees around the pad. You get the four standard 2-in-1 modes: notebook, tablet, display and tent plus angles in-between. It took Lenovo three years to develop the Yoga Book and with its innovative design and functionality, you can see why. But there are issues with Lenovo’s approach. First, I wouldn’t use Yoga Book to record screeds of handwritten notes as I rarely create them. In image form, handwritten notes aren’t searchable unless you convert your handwriting to digital text. Depending on your handwriting quality, that can be hit and miss. Depending on your handwriting quality, that can be hit and miss. Second, I am used to seeing my handwriting appear under the pen as I write it, not off to the left on a display. That rules out me using the stylus without the ink cartridge. And that means every so often paying for ink refills. If you sketch in colour, you’ll have normal dark ink flowing underneath your pen with the colour appearing on the display on the left. In concept Lenovo has taken sketching on a tablet screen directly and shifted it to sketching on a separate Wacom-style device next to the screen. That may suit some but not me. Lenovo Yoga Book. Another issue is the keyboard. It’s cooler than school to have an electronic, virtualised keyboard suddenly appear on an otherwise blank capacitive touch area. It’s even cooler that it works as a real keyboard and you can type on it. In practice it has limitations. The main issue is accuracy. On a regular keyboard you can feel when you hit the edge of a key or mis-hit it altogether. You don’t get that feedback with this keyboard. There’s no travel. You can suddenly look up and see your text littered with mistakes. Lenovo understands the ergonomics of keyboards, having produced excellent ones for its X1 Carbon notebooks with curved keys that help your fingers slide to the centre. I managed to adapt to the Yoga Book keyboard over a few days, but I couldn’t type that quickly and there were occasional latency issues with it not keeping up with my keystrokes as I speeded up. Should Lenovo persist with the Yoga Book concept? Definitely “yes”. I’ve seen the online interviews and there’s great passion behind this product. I love the size and feel of the lightweight Lenovo Book, but I’d prefer one that relied less on dealing with handwriting and sketching for its raison d’etre. Lenovo Yoga Book Instead I’d love a Yoga Book that uses the latest in voice recognition technology that companies like Google are developing, that it becomes a voice dictation powerhouse of the future. Given its small size and weight, versatility as a 2-in-1, decent battery life, good screen resolution and also decent sound reproduction, it would be a winner. As for the electronic virtual keyboard concept, Lenovo could look for alternatives that don’t hamper typing speed. Perhaps they should contact Australian company Sonder which has been developing some interesting alternative keyboards. We recently reported Sonder’s dealing with Apple but a takeover hasn’t been announced yet. The Yoga Book comes in gunmetal grey and champagne gold and has 8 and 2 megapixel rear and front facing cameras. You get a microUSB port for charging, mini HDMI, a headphone jack and slot for a microSD card. But there’s no full USB slot. I was able to connect and read a regular flash drive using a microUSB to USB connector but it wanted to reformat my entire WD 1TB external hard drive when I connected it. I easily read the contents wirelessly of my external NAS box. There are limitations with running a 2-in-1 on Android, here Android Marshmallow, but you need a lightweight operating system of sorts on Atom powered devices. Having said all this, I still give credit to Lenovo for coming up with such an original design. It’s great. This is more a concept product but over time could morph into a great product.

Ad Less than three years from its founding, smart-device maker Eve Tech has already inked a partnership with Microsoft, and more recently secured a six-figure investment from Intel. The team's ambitions are high. Referring to Eve Tech's playfully announced goal, to revive Finnish consumer tech prowess and surpass Nokia, the company's co-founder and CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis has said to Finnish paper Iltalehti: “Nokia is a separate story. They weren’t able to change fast enough. We don’t have that problem.” All of this got started at a poker table in Helsinki. During Karatsevidis' last year of studies he met his future co-founder, Mike, at a poker night; an evening that would evolve into a long discussion about startups and tech. Karatsevidis tells Business Insider Nordic that the two agreed on one thing in particular: “Smart devices were either 'affordable' devices with tasteless design, poor performance and full of bloatware – or Apple devices, nice but terribly overpriced.” Soon afterwards, they founded Eve Tech around a vision to build the perfect product that would be well-functioning, beautiful and affordable. Karatsevidis, the youngest in a 24-man team, brings youthful vision and commercial acumen. At 12, he was already working as an interpreter at tech conferences, and later became a sourcing director in a major company in Ukraine. The co-founder, Mike, is, according to Karatsevidis, a '101% tech geek', and very conscious of his privacy. Eve Tech's core team members have long track records in the industry, having worked on devices including iPhone 6, Fitbit and OnePlus. But what makes Eve Tech stand out is their approach to building devices. “Our vision is to change the way technology is developed by putting end users in charge of development.” The idea was born after Eve Tech’s first product launch in late 2014, of the budget-priced Eve T1 Windows tablet. The T1 had a warm reception internationally and sold well, but the founders would also get a lot of feedback and suggestions for new features. Feedback for the T1 prompted Eve-Tech to involve customers and tech enthusiasts in the design process. Eve-Tech Karatsevidis says they noticed that the same was true in the smart device market as a whole: “Most of the players, like Apple, Samsung and Lenovo were established decades ago and their management is simply not used to the new online age. Because of this, the device-creating process [...] is compromised many times, the original intent is lost, and the end users’ demands are not understood.” That prompted Eve Tech to set up an online platform where the company could connect with with tech enthusiasts and users, and receive new feature suggestions – ranging from battery specs and device color, all the way to which external ports to include. Throughout this year, the community has contributed to a project codenamed Pyramid Flipper (referring to a corporate pyramid turned on its head), a laptop-tablet hybrid. Community members have had direct access to the product design team, and no internal decision has been made without the community's input. The community’s most active and skilled members, ‘Insiders’, are bound by an NDA, and, according to Karatsevidis, considered as an external board of directors. Beyond technical feature suggestions, the 1,300 people strong community has doubled as an early customer focus group. Karatsevidis gave an example to Finnish paper Iltalehti: The Eve Tech team were debating if they should use pen for their forthcoming product’s touchscreen, but decided it was not necessary. But after a poll among the community revealed that 89% of the members would not buy the device without a pen, Eve Tech “had no choice” but to include it. The Pyramid Flipper project was later redubbed into what is now the Eve V laptop, and it includes several features sourced from the community. Here is the (current) look of the 12,3 inch, detachable Windows 10 laptop-tablet hybrid. Eve Tech According to Eve Tech’s website, their lean and community-based philosophy results in: A cheaper product, by cutting out middlemen and only selling online Design that is adapted to customer needs Less pre-installed bloatware Next month Eve Tech will put 500 units of its new laptop on early release as it launches an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to mass produce the Eve V. The company has said the budget model will be around $900, and the one with a bigger screen (above) $1,800 dollars excluding tax. When asked about the biggest community-related lesson learnt, Karatsevidis said that honesty was key: "Being upfront about the company’s limited resources resulted in a self-aware and smart community that feels like a big family. For the next project we will improve our community platform in order to make collaboration and idea-tracking easier." Eve Tech's future ambitions extend beyond smart devices. Karatsevidis says his dream is to keep co-creating new products with his community: 'We are very hyped about alternative reality, AI, electric cars and boats.'

of Tech Vendors, and Also Shows Correlation Between Customer Experience And Loyalty News provided by Temkin Group Oct 31, 2016, 08:30 ET Share this article WABAN, Mass., Oct. 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Temkin Group recently published its fifth annual Temkin Experience Ratings of Tech Vendors which rates the customer experience of 62 large technology vendors based on feedback from 800 IT decision makers within large North American organizations. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161028/433990LOGO  The top four firms earned "excellent" Temkin Experience Ratings, which is a score of 70% or higher. HPE outsourcing topped the list with a score of 76%, followed by IBM SPSS with 74%, Google with 70%, and HP products with 70%. Nine other tech vendors earned ratings above 65%: VMware, IBM software (not SPSS), IBM outsourcing, Dell outsourcing, Microsoft servers, IBM IT services, Intel, Microsoft business applications, and Salesforce.com. The bottom three firms earned Temkin Experience Ratings below 40%, Capgemini, Infosys, and Accenture consulting. Ten other firms also earned "very poor" ratings (below 50%): CSC, SunGard, Cognizant IT services, McAfee, Pitney Bowes, Alcatel-Lucent, Trend Micro, ADP outsourcing, BMC, Satyam. "The customer experience delivered by tech vendors is strongly related to the loyalty of their enterprise IT clients, so it's disappointing that we did not see an increase in the ratings this year," states Bruce Temkin, Managing Partner of Temkin Group. The average Temkin Experience Ratings across all of the tech vendors is 58%, which is a slight drop from 59% last year. The Temkin Experience Ratings evaluates three areas of customer experience: success (can customers achieve what they want to do), effort (how easy is it for customers to do what they want to do), and emotion (how do customers feel about their interaction). In the research report, 2016 Temkin Experience Ratings of Tech Vendors, Temkin Group also examines the relationship between customer experience and customer loyalty. The analysis shows a high correlation between technology vendors' customer experience ratings and a number of areas of loyalty. Here are some additional findings in the research: The average emotion ratings jumped to 56% from 52% last year, the highest level over five years. Temkin Experience Ratings is very highly correlated (R=0.81) to the likelihood of IT decisions to repurchase from the tech vendors. Temkin Experience Ratings is very highly correlated (R=0.87) to Net Promoter® Score, which is a popular measurement of IT decision maker's likelihood to recommend the vendor. When compared with the bottom quartile of companies in the Temkin Experience Ratings with those in the top quartile, the leaders have a 21 percentage-point advantage in customers that are likely to repurchase from the vendors, a 22 percentage-point advantage in customers that are likely to forgive the vendor if it makes a mistake, and a 25 percentage-point advantage in customers' willingness to try new products.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Lenovo to release the Miix 720 Surface 5 killer soon 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Oct 31, 2016 at 11:35 GMT2 weeks ago While Microsoft has decided to postpone the update to their Surface tablet line till next year, it appears Lenovo is getting ready to deliver a new iteration of their Surface clone in time for the Holiday season. Winfuture.de has managed to obtain pictures and specs for their new PC tablet, the Lenovo Miix 720, which includes updated specs and new features which should make it competitive with Microsoft’s still unannounced new Surface Pro successor. The Mixx 720 features Intel’s latest “Kaby Lake” processor available in i3, i5 or i7 versions (2.4 to 3.5 GHz with turboboost), 4-16 GB RAM, 128 to 1024 GB storage, a 12 inch high-resolution 3:2 2880×1920 pixel display with Gorilla Glass 4, multiple USB ports, a stylus with 2048 pressure levels and Windows Hello via an iris scanning infra-red camera. A keyboard cover is also available which now comes with a backlight. The tablet also has a 1 megapixel front and 5 megapixel rear camera. See all the specs below: The tablet is differentiated by having a full suite of ports, including a USB 3.0 and 2.0 in full-size, and also USB type C with Thunderbolt 3 support. The 41-watt battery with 5319mAh should support up to 8 hours run time and the whole package is only 8.9 mm thick (14.6 mm with the type cover). See images of the tablet below: Gallery The package should be at least 1000 Euro, but still cheaper than Microsoft’s own Surface line. I’ve in general had good experiences with my Lenovo Yoga PCs, and am seriously considering this device. Are any of our readers also tempted?

U.K.-based Graphcore is aiming to ship its chips next year to be used in applications from driverless cars to cloud computing, processes that will require machine-learning technology. This involves large amounts of data being used to teach AI systems. Graphcore said its processors will be up to 100 times better than current solutions in the market when it comes to how quickly the AI can learn, as well as the amount of energy consumed. Currently, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) are used to run machine-learning applications. But Nigel Toon, the chief executive of Graphcore said these are not suitable for the future. "GPUs have been built to run programs that completely describe the algorithm. Machine learning is different. You are trying to teach the system using data and that requires a different style of compute," Toon told CNBC in a phone interview on Monday. Angelo Merendino | AFP | Getty Images Pilot models of the Uber self-driving car are displayed at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center on September 13, 2016, in Pittsburgh. Graphcore is creating what it calls an Intelligent Processing Unit (IPU) system to market in 2017. The funding round was led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and included Samsung, as well as venture capital firms Amadeus Capital Partners, C4 Ventures, Draper Esprit, Foundation Capital and Pitango Venture Capital. Graphcore has been working on its technology for the past two years and Toon claims that the technology will be able to help reduce data center costs and improve efficiencies. Toon gave the example of a social media company that typically has the most users at certain times of the day. But when user levels are low, the servers which would have Graphcore's IPU, could use the downtime to train AI systems, then deploy that update the following day. The market is potentially huge, with spending on hardware for deep learning projects set to grow from $436 million in 2015 to $41.5 billion by 2024, according to marketing intelligence firm Tractica. But at the moment, that market is dominated by incumbents Nvidia and Intel. Both companies earlier this year unveiled next generation processors specifically designed for running artificial intelligence applications. Initally, the start-up is aiming to sell to firms that are looking to train AI systems but the company said it is already talking to its strategic investors about the next wave of applications. "We have Bosch as a strategic investor, we have Samsung as an investor and Bosch is interested in autonomous vehicles and the next generation of transportation, while Samsung is interested in missing word edge of network devices," Toon said. "We are working with partners on some of these other applications."

Grimes (InfoWorld) 31 October, 2016 21:00 - - - - print email Comments Make no mistake: Professional and state-sponsored cybercriminals are trying to compromise your identity -- either at home, to steal your money; or at work, to steal your employer’s money, sensitive data, or intellectual property. Most users know the basics of computer privacy and safety when using the internet, including running HTTPS and two-factor authentication whenever possible, and checking haveibeenpwned.com to verify whether their email addresses or user names and passwords have been compromised by a known attack. [ Watch out for 11 signs you've been hacked -- and learn how to fight back, in InfoWorld's PDF special report. | Discover how to secure your systems with InfoWorld's Security Report newsletter. ] But these days, computer users should go well beyond tightening their social media account settings. The security elite run a variety of programs, tools, and specialized hardware to ensure their privacy and security is as strong as it can be. Here, we take a look at this set of tools, beginning with those that provide the broadest security coverage down to each specific application for a particular purpose. Use any, or all, of these tools to protect your privacy and have the best computer security possible. Everything starts with a secure device Good computer security starts with a verified secure device, including safe hardware and a verified and intended boot experience. If either can be manipulated, there is no way higher-level applications can be trusted, no matter how bulletproof their code. Enter the Trusted Computing Group. Supported by the likes of IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and others, TCG has been instrumental in the creation of open, standard-based secure computing devices and boot pathways, the most popular of which are the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip and self-encrypting hard drives. Your secure computing experience begins with TPM. TPM. The TPM chip provides secure cryptographic functions and storage. It stores trusted measurements and private keys of higher-level processes, enabling encryption keys to be stored in the most secure manner possible for general-purpose computers. With TPM, computers can verify their own boot processes, from the firmware level up. Almost all PC manufacturers offer models with TPM chips. If your privacy is paramount, you’ll want to ensure the device you use has an enabled TPM chip. UEFI. Universal Extensible Firmware Interface is an open standards firmware specification that replaces the far less secure BIOS firmware chips. When enabled, UEFI 2.3.1 and later allow device manufacturers to “lock” in the device’s originating firmware instructions; any future updates must be signed and validated in order to update the firmware. BIOS, on the other hand, can be corrupted with a minimum number of malicious bytes to “brick” the system and make it unusable until sent back to the manufacturer. Without UEFI, sophisticated malicious code can be installed to bypass all your OS’s security protections. Unfortunately, there is no way to convert from BIOS to UEFI, if that’s what you have. Secure operating system boot. Your operating system will need self-checking processes to ensure its intended boot process hasn’t been compromised. UEFI-enabled systems (v.2.3.1 and later) can use UEFI’s Secure Boot process to begin a trusted boot process. Non-UEFI systems may have a similar feature, but it’s important to understand that if the underlying hardware and firmware do not have the necessary self-checking routines built in, upper-level operating system checks cannot be trusted as much. Secure storage. Any device you use should have secure, default, encrypted storage, for both its primary storage and any removable media storage devices it allows. Local encryption makes it significantly harder for physical attacks to read your personal data. Many of today’s hard drives are self-encrypting, and many OS vendors (including Apple and Microsoft) have software-based drive encryption. Many portable devices offer full-device encryption out of the box. You should not use a device and/or OS that does not enable default storage encryption. Two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is fast becoming a must in today’s world, where passwords are stolen by the hundreds of millions annually. Whenever possible, use and require 2FA for websites storing your personal information or email. If your computing device supports 2FA, turn it on there. When 2FA is required, it ensures an attacker can’t simply guess or steal your password. (Note that using a single biometric factor, such as a fingerprint, is not even close to being as secure as 2FA. It’s the second factor that gives the strength.) 2FA ensures that an attacker cannot phish you out of your logon credentials as easily as they could if you were using a password alone. Even if they get your password or PIN, they will still have to get the second logon factor: biometric trait, USB device, cellphone, smart card, device, TPM chip, and so on. It has been done, but is significantly more challenging. Be aware, though, that if an attacker gains total access to the database that authenticates your 2FA logon, they will have the super admin access necessary to access your data without your 2FA credentials. Logon account lockout. Every device you use should lock itself when a certain number of bad logons have been attempted. The number isn’t important. Any value between 5 and 101 is reasonable enough to keep an attacker from guessing your password or PIN. However, lower values mean that unintentional logons might end up locking you out of your device. Remote find. Device loss or theft is one of the most common means of data compromise. Most of today’s devices (or OSes) come with a feature, often not enabled by default, to find a lost or stolen device. Real-life stories abound in which people have been able to find their devices, often at a thief’s location, by using remote-find software. Of course, no one should confront a thief. Always get law enforcement involved. Remote wipe. If you can’t find a lost or stolen device, the next best thing is to remotely wipe all personal data. Not all vendors offer remote wipe, but many, including Apple and Microsoft, do. When activated, the device, which is hopefully already encrypted and protected against unauthorized logons, will either wipe all private data when a certain number of incorrect logons are entered or when instructed to do so upon the next connection to the internet (after being instructed to wipe itself by you). All of the above provide a foundation for an overall secure computing experience. Without firmware, boot, and storage encryption protection mechanisms, a truly secure computing experience cannot be ensured. But that’s only the start. True privacy requires a secure network The most paranoid computer security practitioners want every network connection they use to be secured. And it all starts with a VPN. Secure VPN. Most of us are familiar with VPNs, from connecting remotely to our work networks. Corporate VPNs provide secure connectivity from your offsite remote location to the company network, but often offer no or limited protection to any other network location. Many hardware devices and software programs allow you to use a secure VPN no matter where you connect. With these boxes or programs, your network connection is encrypted from your device to your destination, as far as possible. The best VPNs hide your originating information and/or randomly tunnel your connection among many other participating devices, making it harder for eavesdroppers to determine your identity or location. Tor is the most used, free, secure VPN service available today. Using a Tor-enabled browser, all of your network traffic is routed over randomly selected intermediate nodes, encrypting as much as the traffic as possible. Tens of millions of people rely on Tor to provide a reasonable level of privacy and security. But Tor has many well-known weaknesses, ones that other secure VPN solutions, such as MIT’s Riffle or Freenet are attempting to solve. Most of these attempts, however, are more theoretical than deployed (for example, Riffle) or require opt-in, exclusionary participation to be more secure (such as Freenet). Freenet, for example, will only connect to other participating Freenet nodes (when in “darknet” mode) that you know of in advance. You can’t connect to other people and sites outside of Freenet when in this mode. Anonymity services. Anonymity services, which may or may not provide VPN as well, are an intermediate proxy that completes a network request on behalf of the user. The user submits his or her connection attempt or browser connection to the anonymity site, which completes the query, obtains the result, and passes it back to the user. Anyone eavesdropping on the destination connection would be more likely to be stopped from tracking beyond the anonymity site, which hides the originator’s information. There are loads of anonymity services available on the web. Some anonymity sites store your information, and some of these have been compromised or forced by law enforcement to provide user information. Your best bet for privacy is to choose an anonymity site, like Anonymizer, that doesn’t store your information for longer than the current request. Another popular, commercial secure VPN service is HideMyAss. Anonymity hardware. Some people have attempted to make Tor and Tor-based anonymity easier using specially configured hardware. My favorite is Anonabox (model: anbM6-Pro), which is a portable, Wi-Fi-enabled VPN and Tor router. Instead of having to configure Tor on your computer/device, you can simply use Anonabox instead. Secure VPNs, anonymity services, and anonymity hardware can enhance your privacy greatly by securing your network connections. But one big note of caution: No device or service offering security and anonymity has proved to be 100 percent secure. Determined adversaries and unlimited resources can probably eavesdrop on your communications and determine your identity. Everyone who uses a secure VPN, anonymity services, or anonymity hardware should communicate with the knowledge that any day their private communications could become public. Secure applications are a must as well With a secure device and secure connections, security experts use the most (reasonable) secure applications they can find. Here’s a rundown of some of your best bets for protecting your privacy. Secure browsing. Tor leads the way for secure, almost end-to-end Internet browsing. When you can’t use Tor or a Tor-like VPN, make sure the browser you use has been set to its most secure settings. You want to prevent unauthorized code (and sometimes legitimate code) from executing without your being aware. If you have Java, uninstall it (if not using it) or make sure critical security patches are applied. Most browsers now offer “private browsing” modes. Microsoft calls this feature InPrivate; Chrome, Incognito. These modes erase or do not store browsing history locally and are useful in preventing local, unauthorized forensic investigations from being as fruitful. Use HTTPS for all internet searches (and connections to any website), especially in public locations. Enable your browser’s Do Not Track features. Additional software can prevent your browser experience from being tracked, including browser extensions Adblock Plus, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, or DoNotTrackPlus. Some popular sites try to detect these extensions and block your use of their sites unless you disable them while on their sites. Secure email. The original “killer app” for the internet, email is well-known for violating user’s privacy. The internet’s original open standard for securing email, S/MIME, is being less used all the time. S/MIME requires each participating user to exchange public encryption keys with other users. This requirement has proved overly daunting for less savvy users of the internet. These days most corporations that require end-to-end email encryption use commercial email services or appliances that allow secure email to be sent via HTTPS-enabled sites. Most commercial users of these services or devices say they are easy to implement and work with, but can sometimes be very expensive. On the personal side there are dozens of secure email offerings. The most popular (and widely used in many businesses) is Hushmail. With Hushmail, you either use the Hushmail website to send and receive secure email or install and use a Hushmail email client program (available for desktops and some mobile devices). You can use your own, original email address, which gets proxied through Hushmail’s proxy services, or obtain a Hushmail email address, a cheaper solution. Hushmail is one among dozens of secure email providers currently available. Secure chat. Most OS- and device-provided chat programs do not offer strong security and privacy. For strong end-to-end security you need to install an additional chat program. Luckily, there are dozens of chat programs, both free and commercial, that claim to offer greater security. Some require installation of a client app; others offer website services. Most require all parties to communicate with the same program or use the same website (or at least the same chat protocol and protection). Common secure chat programs include ChatCrypt, ChatSecure, and Cryptocat. Most secure chat clients have the same basic features, so pick the one that enables you to communicate with the broadest set of people you need to securely chat with. Secure payments. Most payment systems are required to store lots of information about you and your purchases, and they are usually required to provide payment or payer details when asked by law enforcement. Even if they aren’t required to provide detailed data to the police or governments, many payment databases are compromised each year by malicious hackers. Most users wishing for greater payment anonymity on the internet are turning to online cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Users must first buy bitcoins, usually via traditional online payment methods, and must go through bitcoin exchanges to get their bitcoin value back out into traditional currencies. Each exchange into and out of bitcoin typically takes a small payment fee. Of course, the privacy and anonymity of virtual currencies comes with real risk. They are usually not considered legal currency and may not be provided the same protections under law as “real” currencies. They may also have incredible price volatility, with the value of your holdings potentially jumping or declining by huge margins in a single day. It’s also possible that a single crypto attack could result in permanent, unrecoverable loss. Hackers have been successful in stealing millions of dollars in bitcoins, and sometimes those thefts are not reimbursed by the compromised holders. As for credit cards, you can buy and use temporary online (or physical) credit cards. Most credit card agencies offer temporary cards, often at slightly high fee rates, which can be used for a temporary set period of time or even one-time use. If a website gets compromised, exposing your temporary credit card, you won’t be at a loss because you’ll never use it again. Secure file transfers. Probably the only class of applications that offer more alternatives than secure email is secure file transfer. Any program using SSH or SCP allows encrypted and secure file sharing, and there are dozens, if not hundreds, of commercial offerings. Users who wish to securely share files while also preserving their anonymity have a myriad of choices. One of the most popular commercial services is BTGuard. It provides file anonymity services over the BitTorrent, a very popular peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Anything Phil Zimmerman creates. Phil Zimmermann, creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), cares deeply about privacy. He was willing to risk being arrested, imprisoned, and even potentially faced the U.S. death penalty because he strongly believed that everyone on the planet deserved good privacy tools. Every good and experienced computer security person I know and trust uses PGP. To work with PGP, each participant creates their own private/public key pair and shares their public key with other participants for securely sending files, emails, or other content. Symantec bought and has supported PGP commercially since 2010, but dozens of open source versions are available and trusted, including OpenPGP. If you don’t have PGP, get it, install it, and use it. Zimmermann, who was also behind Hushmail, is a co-founder of Silent Circle, which offers secure solutions for a range of technologies. It even offers the Blackphone, which was designed from the ground up to be the most secure, generally accessible cellphone ever. There have been some hacks of the Blackphone, but it still is the cellphone that prizes privacy and security above all other features -- at least as much as one can and still sell the product to the general population. Whatever Phil Zimmermann creates or promotes can be assured to be well thought out, delivering privacy and security in spades.

As more details of how it works emerge, TechCrunch has confirmed that it takes advantage of hardware and software derived from the Apple Watch, including a custom ARM-based processor and watchOS itself. TechCrunch cites tweets by developer Steve Troughton-Smith as well as additional research that back up his findings. Apple announced that Touch ID on its new MacBook Pros is implemented using the same Secure Enclave architecture that it uses on iPhones, but now integrated into a new custom T1 processor, derived from the S2 which powers current Apple Watch models.The primary OS and CPU are never involved when accessing secure data, such as when authenticating an Apple Pay transaction with a fingerprint - in the case of the iPhone, that means one of Apple's own A-series SoCs and iOS, whereas now Intel x86 CPUs and macOS can also be bridged. Fingerprint patterns are stored only within the Secure Enclave, and it is paired to the parent device with a unique identifier at the time of manufacture, which means separating the two will cause Touch ID to stop working - and also means that replacing parts might result in a loss of functionality. The Touch Bar essentially runs its own embedded OS, which is derived from watchOS. The main computer generates graphics for it and reacts to its touch inputs, which are sent and received over USB just as any input/output peripheral would. Troughton-Smith theorises that the Touch Bar could therefore work as an independent device even when the MacBook Pro is turned off.  Apple has long been rumoured to be working on more powerful versions of its iOS devices' A-series chips to replace the Intel processors in some if not all of the Mac lineup. Apple has also famously resisted using touchscreens on its desktops and laptops, clearly delineating its Mac and iOS philosophies. This approach shows that Apple has brought the two together in ways that serve specific purposes.  Touch Bar debuted with the new MacBook Pro 2016. It is not currently available on any other models, but if Apple wants to establish common conventions across its product lines and keep developers motivated to support it, a standalone keyboard for at least the Mac Pro should launch soon. However, the feature has pushed the price of the MacBook Pro 2016 up considerably, compared to the non-Touch Bar model as well as the previous generation, which was introduced in 2012.

Today, we are announcing a limited-time "trade up" offer to invite more people to experience Surface. Starting today, anyone in the U.S. can trade in their MacBook Pro or MacBook Air at a Microsoft Store or online for up to $650 off a Surface Book or Surface Pro. Microsoft (also, The bizarre role reversal of Apple and Microsoft) A quantum leap for the web Over the past year, our top priority for Firefox was the Electrolysis project to deliver a multi-process browsing experience to users. Running Firefox in multiple processes greatly improves security and performance. This is the largest change we've ever made to Firefox, and we’ll be rolling out the first stage of Electrolysis to 100% of Firefox desktop users over the next few months. But, that doesn't mean we’re all out of ideas in terms of how to improve performance and security. In fact, Electrolysis has just set us up to do something we think will be really big. Medium Internet Archive, repository of modern culture, turns 20 When the Internet Archive was created 20 years ago, few envisioned how a small galaxy of about 500,000 websites would evolve into the center of human communication and culture. Now, the nonprofit San Francisco organization -- which celebrated the milestone with a party Wednesday night -- curates a vast digital archive that includes more than 370 million websites and 273 billion pages, many captured before they disappeared forever. San Francisco Chronicle Google's AI created its own form of encryption Researchers from the Google Brain deep learning project have already taught AI systems to make trippy works of art, but now they're moving on to something potentially darker: AI-generated, human-independent encryption. According to a new research paper, Googlers Martín Abadi and David G. Andersen have willingly allowed three test subjects -- neural networks named Alice, Bob and Eve -- to pass each other notes using an encryption method they created themselves. Engadget This guy has the fastest home internet in the United States What does the guy with the fastest internet in the United States use his jealousy-inducing bandwidth for? Analyzing X-rays… and gaining an advantage in Call of Duty, of course. Startup and community-run internet service providers have grabbed headlines over the last two years as they’ve begun rolling out the first 10 gigabit-per-second residential internet connections in the United States. Vice Breaking the multicore bottleneck Researchers at North Carolina State University and at Intel have come up with a solution to one of the modern microprocessor's most persistent problems: communication among the processor's many cores. Their answer is a dedicated set of logic circuits they call the Queue Management Device, or QMD. In simulations, integrating the QMD with the processor's on-chip network at a minimum doubled core-to-core communication speed and, in some cases, boosted it much further. IEEE Spectrum Making energy-harvesting computers reliable A revolutionary and emerging class of energy-harvesting computer systems require neither a battery nor a power outlet to operate, instead operating by harvesting energy from their environment. While radio waves, solar energy, heat, and vibrations have the ability to power devices, harvested energy sources are weak leading to an "intermittent execution", with periodic power failures and unreliable behavior. Phys.org Star Citizen diary, part 2: Riding shotgun in the game's biggest ship Let me get to the important stuff first, the question that's been on everyone's mind since I posted my first Star Citizen diary last week: did I wind up buying a new cap? I did. A blue one. Also, a blue jacket, a blue shirt, and blue pants. I do have a bit of buyer's remorse, since I probably should have saved my spacebux for a new spacesuit instead, or perhaps for an energy rifle. PC Gamer (part 1) Want to see gaming's past and future? Dive into the "educational" world of PLATO In the days of mainframe computing, one system stood miles ahead of the rest. PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations) wasn't special for its power or speed or graphical prowess, though. It was remarkable for the ideas that drove its development and for the breadth of its impact -- starting in the 1960s and accelerating through the '70s and '80s, PLATO terminals became omnipresent throughout schools, universities, and offices around the world. Ars Technica Component shortages expected in PC market after November With smartphone vendors having been aggressively placing short-term orders for the fourth quarter, several component suppliers have been delaying their shipments to PC vendors recently and the action could relatively impact these PC vendors' shipments in the quarter. Because of the recall of its Galaxy Note 7, Samsung Electronics has been increasing its orders for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, hoping to minimize the impact in its shipment performance... Digitimes 3D-printed heart-on-a-chip with integrated sensors Harvard University researchers have made the first entirely 3D-printed organ-on-a-chip with integrated sensing. Built by a fully automated, digital manufacturing procedure, the 3D-printed heart-on-a-chip can be quickly fabricated and customized, allowing researchers to easily collect reliable data for short-term and long-term studies. Harvard Congress needs more information before the government's new hacking powers kick in The federal government is set to get massively expanded hacking powers later this year. Thankfully, members of Congress are starting to ask questions. In a letter this week to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, 23 members of Congress -- including Sens. Ron Wyden and Patrick Leahy and Rep. John Conyers -- pressed for more information and said they "are concerned about the full scope of the new authority" under pending changes to federal investigation rules. EFF New method increases energy density in lithium batteries Yuan Yang, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Columbia Engineering, has developed a new method to increase the energy density of lithium (Li-ion) batteries. He has built a trilayer structure that is stable even in ambient air, which makes the battery both longer lasting and cheaper to manufacture. The work, which may improve the energy density of lithium batteries by 10-30%, is published online today in Nano Letters. Columbia University 7,500 people to get texts asking for info in Frederick John Hatch homicide, OPP say In a move they're describing as "extraordinary" and "unprecedented," Ontario Provincial Police will send text messages to about 7,500 people on Thursday to ask for information about an unsolved homicide. Investigators are calling it a "digital canvass" — the high-tech equivalent of knocking on thousands of doors for information. CBC Pizza, the unsung agent of the robot revolution It wasn't so long ago that the idea of biped or quadruped robots delivering pizzas seemed like a real possibility. Such speculation was fuelled by Google's acquisition of Boston Dynamics -- a company more associated with potential military applications, which earned notoriety for its scarily nimble Big Dog robots. Ars Technica Hybrid nanostructures hold hydrogen well Layers of graphene separated by nanotube pillars of boron nitride may be a suitable material to store hydrogen fuel in cars, according to Rice University scientists. The Department of Energy has set benchmarks for storage materials that would make hydrogen a practical fuel for light-duty vehicles. Rice University Making computers explain themselves In recent years, the best-performing systems in artificial-intelligence research have come courtesy of neural networks, which look for patterns in training data that yield useful predictions or classifications. A neural net might, for instance, be trained to recognize certain objects in digital images or to infer the topics of texts. MIT How 2K killed Irrational Games  I am a life long video game developer.

A committed Christian who nearly went into the church rather than technology, he gives away 40pc of his salary, prays and sings hymns on journeys from his Californian office to the airport and resolved early in life to never read his daily business newspaper until he had first read the Bible. Right now, however, all that everybody wants to hear is how the chief executive of VMware, the $32bn (£26.2bn) market capitalisation US technology group, is getting on with Michael Dell. There are no assets in a software company other than the people Dell’s eponymous private equity-backed computer-maker has just paid $67bn for EMC, the American group that owns 80pc of VMware, and the 10,000-strong following at the VMworld Europe conference in Barcelona this month was awash with interest in how the duo will gel. Gelsinger, after all, is a technocrat who worked for 30 years at Intel, rising to chief technology officer, while entrepreneurial Dell famously founded the PC company in his Austin, Texas college dorm. “We’re getting on very well,” insists Gelsinger, 54. “We’ve just had our first board meeting with Michael as the new presiding chairman of my board and I’d say that, overall, while it’s early and I don’t think either one of us would say we’ve figured it all out yet, all signs are encouraging. “We’ve committed to $1bn of synergies, so we have to go and start building the organisations to materialise that.” Such caution typifies Gelsinger’s understated approach. More Bill Gates than Larry Ellison, he is down to earth, engaging and ever-polite. Gelsinger has been working alongside Michael Dell Credit: julian simmonds What are his impressions of his new boss so far? He’s pleased that Dell declared his support for VMware’s “ecosystem” of reseller partners at the company’s even larger VMworld US conference in Las Vegas. He thinks Dell was impressed by that event’s 25,000-strong crowd – more than double the attendees at the EMC or Dell annual shindigs. There’s a lot for Dell to get his head around. EMC was an unusual company with a portfolio strategy of nurturing part-owned businesses including VMware and Pivotal, a spin-off owned together with Microsoft, Ford and General Electric and chaired by Paul Maritz, the veteran former Microsoft and VMware executive. “Michael has quite bought into that strategy,” says Gelsinger. “He definitely understands that a software company like VMware is a different company, a different culture. “Software people are different to people doing hardware and supply chain. There are no assets in a software company other than the people. That’s a key aspect of running a company like ours and he sees us as a very successful business. “He’s giving us the space and support to go out and execute what we need to do. And he has a lot to get done in merging Dell and EMC. There are 140,000 people to put together there, big product lines to merge and organisations to form.” VMware’s name stands for “virtual machine software” – technology that essentially allows firms to pack their data on far fewer server computers. The company recently struck important alliances with cloud computing leader Amazon and with IBM. It is retaining its stock market listing following the takeover. “I have the pleasure of seeing the shareholders every 90 days,” Gelsinger smiles. However, VMware’s shares nearly halved from $80 to a low of $43 after the deal’s announcement. “That was a pretty painful process,” he says. “There were clearly concerns about whether Dell could make a software company successful. “There were questions around a tracking stock that was part of the takeover and the implications of that. As with any big acquisition, there were also concerns about whether the deal would get done.” Michael Dell on Cloud Technology, U.S. Election & Economy Play! 07:29 There were also questions about VMware’s business, as the guidance it gave on earnings last year was less than Wall Street expected. However, the stock price rose as the companies got closer to completing the deal. “We’ve been able to affirm to the marketplace the continuing ecosystem and independence of VMware and some of the new product areas and cloud strategy we’ve rolled out have helped address some of the concerns,” says Gelsinger. “With the shares now around £77, we’re still not trading at the software multiple that we should have, so we’re not entirely through the fog. But we’ve come a long way and I believe there’s tremendous upside potential.” Gelsinger, who chairs Transforming Bay with Christ, a group aimed at bringing about “spiritual and societal” change in the San Francisco area, clearly runs VMware with the same kind of missionary zeal. He talks about “digital transformation” and how some of the world’s biggest businesses are simplifying their IT infrastructures to innovate at a more rapid pace. With machine-driven devices predicted to overtake human-driven efforts by 2019, he feels that many businesses are still totally unprepared for the imminent explosion of the “internet of things”. Where Will VMWare Find New Customers Play! 05:00 He also holds that the tech sector is still in its “teenage years,” with huge tensions between its control and freedom. Half of the biggest US technology firms will have disappeared in 10 years’ time due to these and other difficulties, he predicts. He won’t name any, of course, but Nokia, BlackBerry and Yahoo are three IT brands whose star has dimmed significantly since he predicted major industry carnage in The Daily Telegraph three years ago, while British computer chip designer ARM and of course EMC have been taken over. VMware, however, has been an excellent investment for EMC. Founded by Diane Greene and her husband Mendel Rosenblum with colleagues in California in 1998, it was bought by EMC six years later for £625m. In 2007 EMC floated the company on the New York Stock Exchange, retaining an 80pc stake. Maritz replaced Greene as CEO, quadrupling revenues to $4.5bn. Then Gelsinger switched over from EMC to succeed Maritz in 2012. VMware now has 400,000 customers, 19,000 workers, 2015 revenues of $6.6bn and 120 locations around the world, including its UK headquarters in Frimley, Surrey. Gelsinger grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania. His father was one of nine children, while his mother was from a family of 11 and he skipped his last year of high school at the age of 17 to take up a scholarship to study electronics at Lincoln Technical Institute in his home state. His faith clearly drives him. He led a weekly home Bible study for 16 years and served as a Sunday school teacher, while his philanthropy supports medical relief, church planting organisations, educational work and an orphanage the he and his wife Linda helped build in Nairobi. At Intel, which he joined from the institute, he frequently worked 80-hour weeks, arousing complaints from the payroll department that he was working too much overtime. To fix that, for a period in his married life, he and Linda devised a system whereby he would score two points if he got home before 5pm, one point if before 6.15pm, zero after that and minus one point for being away at weekends. He’s even written about it in a book called Balancing Your Family, Faith and Work. “I’ve written three books now and I’m working on my fourth,” Gelsinger smiles. It’s one of those labours of love.” As is the merger of course. Watch this space.

And following Baron’s example I also run the same load against MonetDB. Reading comments to Baron’s post I tied to load the same data to LucidDB, but I was not successful in this. I tried to analyze a bigger dataset and I took public available data http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time about USA domestic flights with information about flight length and delays. The data is available from 1988 to 2009 in chunks per month, so I downloaded 252 files (for 1988-2008 years) with size from 170MB to 300MB each. In total raw data is about 55GB. Average amount of rows in each chunk is 483762.46 (the query Q0 is: Shell 
 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; 1 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; for InfoBright and Shell 
with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t 1 with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t for MonetDB. For InfoBright it took 4.19 sec to execute and 29.9 sec for MonetDB, but it’s almost single case where MonetDB was significantly slower) Few words about environment: server Dell SC1425, with 4GB of RAM and Dual Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz. InfoBright (ICE) version: 5.1.14-log build number (revision)=IB_3.2_GA_5316(ice) MonetDB version: server v5.14.2, based on kernel v1.32.2 LucidDB was 0.9.1 The table I loaded data is: Shell

Load procedure: Infobright: the loader that comes with ICE version is very limited and I had to transform files to quote each field. After that load statement is: Shell 
mysql -S /tmp/mysql-ib.sock -e "LOAD DATA INFILE '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.tr' INTO TABLE ontime FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"'" ontime 1 mysql -S /tmp/mysql-ib.sock -e "LOAD DATA INFILE '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.tr' INTO TABLE ontime FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"'" ontime The load time for each chunk was about 30s/chunk in initial years and up to 48s/chunk for 2008 year. And total load time is 8836 sec (2.45h). The size of database after load is 1.6G which is impressive and give 1:34 compress ratio. MonetDB: It took some time to figure out how to load text data ( I really wish developers improve documentation), but finally I ended up with next load statement: Shell 
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql --database=ontime -t -s "COPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${Y
EAR}_$i.txt' USING DELIMITERS ',','\n','\"' NULL AS '';" 1 2 /usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql --database=ontime -t -s "COPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${Y EAR}_$i.txt' USING DELIMITERS ',','\n','\"' NULL AS '';" Load time: 13065 sec ( 3.6h) Database size after load is 65G , which is discouraging. It seems it does not use any compression, and it’s bigger than original data. LucidDB Here it took time to find how to execute command from command line using included Shell 
sqlline 1 sqlline utility, and I did not understand how to do that, so I generated big SQL file which contained load statements. Load of each chunk was significantly slower starting with about 60 sec/chunk for initial year and constantly growing to 200 sec / chunk for 2000 year. On 2004 year (after about 5h of loading) the load failed by some reason and I did not try to repeat, as I would not fit in timeframe I allocated for this benchmark. Maybe I will try sometime again. Query execution So I really have data for InfoBright and MonetDB, let see how fast they are in different queries. First favorite query for any database benchmarker is Shell 
SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; 1 SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; . Both InforBritgh and MonetDB executes it immediately with result 117023290 rows Now some random queries I tried again both databases: -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years Shell

My goal was to check how available OpenSource software is able to handle such kind of tasks. Despite InfoBright was slower for many queries, I think it is more production ready and stable. It has Enterprise edition and Support which you can buy. And execution time is really good, taking into account amount of rows engine had to crunch. For query Q8 (1year range) traditional transactional oriented stored engine took 30min to get result. I really like MonetDB. I do not know what is the magic behind the curtain, they also do not have indexes like InfoBright, but results are impressive. On drawbacks – the command line is weak ( I had to use bash and pass query as parameter, otherwise I was not able to edit query or check history), the documentation also needs improvements. The fact it does not use the compression also maybe showstopper, the space consumption is worrying. Addressing these issues I think MonetDB may have commercial success Worth to note that MonetDB supports all INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE statements (and space is price for that as I understand), while InfoBright ICE edition allows you only LOAD DATA. InfoBright Enterprise allows INSERT / UPDATE but that also is not for online transactions processing. Compression in InfoBright is impressive. Even smaller rate 1:10 means you can compress 1TB to 100GB, which is significant economy of space. I am open to run any other queries if you want to compare or get info about air performance.

This comes from the “fewer knobs to tune is better” approach that MonetDB takes. I’m still trying to understand here why “MonetDB does not like to scan many records”, as it seems to me at first sight that a full scan is made in most queries. Anyhow, if it does a plain full scan, it for sure loses from Infobright which really benefits from their excellent compressed storage in that case. Thanks.

I am going to have talk on OpenSQL Camp about this side of Sphinx, I may use this dataset. What would be interesting to see it on multi-cpu box and run Sphinx query in N parallel processes. Reply peter says: October 3, 2009 at 10:30 am Vadim, Couple of questions and notes 1) Did you run query once or several times (so if any self tuning needs to be done it is done) ? 2) I’m wondering if data set you have was giving undue advantage to MonetDB. I see you have touch may be 1/10 of columns which with 4GB of memory gets close to amount of memory you have. I trust Infobright and compression can cost you when data is in memory but if working set is significantly more than amount of memory things may change. 3) What is about Joins ? So far we have only looked at single table queries which do not stress the optimizer a lot. It would be very interesting to see some more complicated multiple table queries too. 4) What is about MyISAM ? It would be really nice to keep it as a baseline. Reply Vadim says: October 3, 2009 at 1:27 pm Peter, 1) I did run queries in loop until I got stable repeatable number. as 2-4) there indeed much more experiments can be done.

I happen to do some BI/DWH for my job, but our volumes are so modest that I haven’t had the need for a special purpose product yet. I’m just interested and try to keep up with all those developments. Reply James Birchall says: October 5, 2009 at 9:18 am Vadim, Infobright ICE does some serious optimisations on columns if they have less then 10,000 unique entries in the column and if you specify “COMMENT ‘lookup'” in the definition (they automatically generate and maintain an ENUM, I think). Think of them like indexes. If you change the definitions for the key columns in the queries, does that change your results at all? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 9:27 am James, That’s good point, I will try to change column definition for fields affected in queries. Reply David says: October 5, 2009 at 7:41 pm Good post, but why not try to run TPC-H test ? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:30 pm David, TPC-H is boring and everyone can run it 🙂 Also it uses some unreal data. Database vendors often publish TPC-H by themselves: see e.g. http://www.monetdb.nl/projects/monetdb/SQL/Benchmark/TPCH/index.html. And I know some companies optimizes performance of database especially for TPC-H load ( I do not point here to InfoBright nor MonetDB, I do not have that facts). So better to take some independent and something that is more interesting for me. Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:38 pm James, I did changes you mentioned, it really affected only Q8, but really affected significantly.

I was hoping you’d do something like this! I really appreciate the use of real world data because in my experience random, dummy data without any similarity to real world data just doesn’t give realistic info when it comes to large datasets. I’m using ICE in production & the data compression is impressive (think green! as Brian Aker says). The query performance is impressive. But queries really have to be optimized and that is a challenge without explain. We’re not using joins (but unlike mysql you can have more columns) and we’re only using INTs, no varchars or date (tho my test with using date resulted in a very very slight increase in load time, not anything noticeable in query time). But if you mess up & run a query with curdate() in it, oh boy is that slow. Then do NOT kill it. That’s a bug (reported & they are working on it). Thanks for doing these benchmarks. erin Reply James Birchall says: October 8, 2009 at 3:00 pm Hey Vadim, One more variation for InfoBright… You might try using the FlightTime fields instead of the Year, Month, DayOfWeek stuff for your range queries. I found that the Knowledge Grid does some wonderful things with range queries over dates that it didn’t do for straight integers (even simple equality). James. Reply John Sichi says: October 11, 2009 at 1:34 pm Hi Vadim, We’ve written up a page with instructions on the LucidDB load (including experimental support for parallel load): http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOtp Best results will probably be achieved with one year per INSERT statement (theoretically you could use a massive UNION ALL to do them all at once, but I haven’t tested that). We’re guessing that the performance degradation and eventual failures you hit may have been due to the blanks for number fields (which LucidDB is picky about); the cleansing CASE expressions are supplied to fix those. In case there are other problems, we’ve included a section on how to enable row rejection for debugging them. Please let me know if you need any help with getting it working or tuned; we’ll be interested to see your results. LucidDB is targeted at complex schemas and queries, but we’d like to know where we stand even on simple table+query environments. Reply Vadim says: October 11, 2009 at 10:20 pm John, Thank you, I will try it in next couple days. Do you have public examples with complex queries and schemas, beside TPC-H ? Thanks, Vadim Reply Carl Gelbart says: October 12, 2009 at 10:51 am Itâ€™s great to see these independent tests of Infobright Community Edition (ICE) and other open source products. The massive compression you saw is typical of what ICE and IEE (enterprise edition) users see. A couple of comments in regards to Infobright: While we have lots of ICE users with relatively small databases (which we would consider under 200GB), the real power of the product can be seen when the database is considerably larger(hundreds of gigabytes to tens of terabytes.) Thatâ€™s when the Knowledge Grid advantages really show, as itâ€™s ability to eliminate the need to access large amounts of data results in great query performance versus other products. Typically we also see that the kinds of queries people run donâ€™t have a where clause that encompasses half the rows in the databases. How about doing a test against a 500 GB database? Try it with putting in a typical report date range (a month?) and see what kind of results you get. As far as getting access to IEE as mentioned by someone above, a free trial is available via download on the Infobright.com website, or we could send it to you if you want. The compression and query speed will be comparable to ICE, but there are more options for loading data and faster load speed. Carl Gelbart Sr. S.E. Infobright Reply Vadim says: October 12, 2009 at 5:26 pm Carl, Thank you for following our blog. I do not have bigger dataset on the hands that I can publish on public. When I have something interesting I will ask access to IEE. Do you have data that you can share ? Reply John Sichi says: October 12, 2009 at 8:49 pm Vadim, The best examples of high schema and query complexity I know of are locked away inside of the now-defunct LucidEra. CRM analytic schemas there involved numerous fact tables (e.g. leads, opportunities, orders, forecasts, quotas), joining on many conforming dimensions (e.g. time, lead owners, salesreps, territories, campaigns, prospects, customers, opportunity type/status, pricing, partners, discounts, on and on…), and in fact many of the fact and dimension “tables” were actually views joining underlying base tables in order to make the warehouse schema accessible via Mondrian’s dimensional model. But if you want to see a reasonable amount of query complexity on a public dataset, use Mondrian’s FOODMART schema with LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOlap And then execute MDX queries involving lots of filtered dimensions, and trace the underlying SQL (you’ll see a lot of star joins). The data volume is piddling though. For schema complexity, I’m not aware of any, but if you can find something that already has Mondrian set up with PostgreSQL or MySQL, we have an automated procedure for replicating that into LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbMondrianReplication Reply Greenplum Single-Node Edition — sometimes free is a real cool price | DBMS2 -- DataBase Management System Services says: October 19, 2009 at 6:25 am […] MySQL Performance blog on MonetDB and Infobright community edition […] Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:17 am Dear Vadim, We appreciate your tryout of the system. We did not found the time yet to load the referenced data and re-run the experiments to shed some light on the questions raised. (Does RITA http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time has a (hidden) textual interface to quickly download the files? Can I download your cvs files?) – we are aware that the documentation can be improved, especially in areas where confusion may arise due to SQL 2003 compliance. – the parallel loading in 5.14 was turned off due to a design error that could materialize in COPY with initial offsets. The November release has it fixed. (on tpch-sf10 loading it is locally 3 x faster then the release you used) – MonetDB does not rely heavily on value compression (the X100 project, now part of VectorWise/Ingres does) MonetDB does, however, use the minimal data types required to store information. – MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps = 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated – The growth in database size most likely comes from the logical references (8bytes) into the dictionary(short strings) – Q7 would be a target for us to run with the statement modifiers EXPLAIN (for plan) and TRACE (for detailed performance trace) We would appreciate those for inspection. – same for Q9. Note that MonetDB does not create any a priory (persistent) index, sorting or clustering to answer aggregate queries. Everything is done at runtime and upon need. Including sampling for grouping. I guess that Infobright benefits here from its partitioning information and compression over sorted tables (year). Q3 is an example that highlights the differences in the ‘rough’. regards, Martin Kersten The MonetDB Team Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:19 am – MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps smaller then 64KB are fully duplicate eliminated string heaps larger then 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated Reply Vadim says: October 31, 2009 at 11:41 am Matin, Thank you for follow up. you can download data by direct links like http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_1988_1.zip just change year and month in loop.

Thanks, Vadim Reply Martin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 5:44 pm Vadim, Thanks for the url. That looks a lot easier then a webform. I will install it as well. We have a monthly bug fix release cycle and a 3-4 month feature release cycle. The feature release date is the last days of November. That version is now internally used as a release candidate. (if you are in a hurry we can provide you with a copy) The SSB is a reduced version of TPC-H. We have looked at it shortly. X100 is a product under development (http://www.vectorwise.com/index_js.php?page=mission_overview).

It appears that some input files have errors (or I used wrong column types). thanks, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 1, 2009 at 9:54 am Martin, I used next schema to load files CREATE TABLE ontime ( YearD int DEFAULT NULL, Quarter tinyint DEFAULT NULL, MonthD tinyint DEFAULT NULL, DayofMonth tinyint DEFAULT NULL, DayOfWeek tinyint DEFAULT NULL, FlightDate date DEFAULT NULL, UniqueCarrier char(7) DEFAULT NULL, AirlineID int DEFAULT NULL, Carrier char(2) DEFAULT NULL, TailNum varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL, FlightNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Origin char(5) DEFAULT NULL, OriginCityName varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL, OriginState char(2) DEFAULT NULL, OriginStateFips varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, OriginStateName varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL, OriginWac int DEFAULT NULL, Dest char(5) DEFAULT NULL, DestCityName varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL, DestState char(2) DEFAULT NULL, DestStateFips varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DestStateName varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL, DestWac int DEFAULT NULL, CRSDepTime int DEFAULT NULL, DepTime int DEFAULT NULL, DepDelay int DEFAULT NULL, DepDelayMinutes int DEFAULT NULL, DepDel15 int DEFAULT NULL, DepartureDelayGroups int DEFAULT NULL, DepTimeBlk varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL, TaxiOut int DEFAULT NULL, WheelsOff int DEFAULT NULL, WheelsOn int DEFAULT NULL, TaxiIn int DEFAULT NULL, CRSArrTime int DEFAULT NULL, ArrTime int DEFAULT NULL, ArrDelay int DEFAULT NULL, ArrDelayMinutes int DEFAULT NULL, ArrDel15 int DEFAULT NULL, ArrivalDelayGroups int DEFAULT NULL, ArrTimeBlk varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL, Cancelled tinyint DEFAULT NULL, CancellationCode char(1) DEFAULT NULL, Diverted tinyint DEFAULT NULL, CRSElapsedTime int DEFAULT NULL, ActualElapsedTime int DEFAULT NULL, AirTime int DEFAULT NULL, Flights int DEFAULT NULL, Distance int DEFAULT NULL, DistanceGroup TINYINT DEFAULT NULL, CarrierDelay int DEFAULT NULL, WeatherDelay int DEFAULT NULL, NASDelay int DEFAULT NULL, SecurityDelay int DEFAULT NULL, LateAircraftDelay int DEFAULT NULL, FirstDepTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, TotalAddGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, LongestAddGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DivAirportLandings varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DivReachedDest varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DivActualElapsedTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DivArrDelay varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, DivDistance varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1Airport varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1WheelsOn varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1TotalGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1LongestGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1WheelsOff varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div1TailNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2Airport varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2WheelsOn varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2TotalGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2LongestGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2WheelsOff varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div2TailNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3Airport varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3WheelsOn varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3TotalGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3LongestGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3WheelsOff varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div3TailNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4Airport varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4WheelsOn varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4TotalGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4LongestGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4WheelsOff varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div4TailNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5Airport varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5WheelsOn varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5TotalGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5LongestGTime varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5WheelsOff varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL, Div5TailNum varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL ); As MonetDB did not allow me to use “Year” and “Month” columns names, I renamed to “YearD”, “MonthD”. I did some pre-processing of csv files, i.e. I put all columns into quotes ” “. Statement to load data into tables was: /usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql –database=ontime -t -s “COPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM ‘/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.clean’ USING DELIMITERS ‘,’,’\n’,’\”‘ NULL AS ”;” Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 12:30 pm Dear Vadim et.al. This data warehouse is interesting, as it is one from the ‘wild’. The dimension and fact tables have been combined into a single table. Furthermore, the varchar(10) used often in the schema is an overshoot for the actual values stored. I have ran the load and queries on the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results can be seen here http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport The results align with those reported here. However, we may consider reviving an old manual technique applied in an older version of MonetDB, which would bring the storage down to ca 10 GB. regards, Martin Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 1:06 pm Vadim et.al. (not sure if my earlier message got through, if so ignore this one) I have installed the database and ran the queries against the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results are summarized in http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 2, 2009 at 12:15 pm Martin, I see you have comment about load time and datasize. Is there something I should change to get better results ? Thanks. Vadim Reply Martin Kersten says: November 2, 2009 at 12:46 pm Vadim The load time is with the default loader settings in the Nov 2009 RC. Unlike the Aug 2009 release, it uses all possible threads to act in the loading. Further improvements, which is still possible, would call for more development in the loader algorithms itself. There is still quite some room to improve further, because we have not reached our CPU nor IO capacity limit. The current algorithm properly deals with variable sized input and requests for OFFSET into the input stream. (which may be coming from stdin) For utmost loading speed there is an attachment option, but that is a totally different story and only relevant for dealing with tables of >1TB. The database size was a little surprise. The OnTime table looks like a flattened star-schema. This means we have a lot of small dimension tables, as indicated in the count overview. It would not be a design aimed at scalability. Furthermore, any varchar() object in MonetDB leads to an overhead of 8 bytes, a logical reference from a column to a string area. This hurts if the actual collection of strings only consists of a handful values and we have 120M references. The way to deal with is well known, and the functionality is part of MonetDB4 as ENUM types. We might put a little compression optimizer in the pipeline, that recognizes and handles this case directly and transparently for the user. SQL users would obtain the same result, if they replaced the corresponding columns with a dictionary table and a TINYINT or SMALLINT and relied on the join to couple them. This, however, would not be our preferred way. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 28, 2009 at 4:11 am There is comment from David Lutz, InfoBright: Hello! I have been testing with this data set, as well, thanks to your suggestion. There are many differences in our two environments and I don’t want to post the whole test as it would be almost as big as your original post. What I did want to offer is that I performed the test on 10 years of data using the current version of Infobright Enterprise Edition (3.2.2) which has a multi-threaded loader. I loaded different years and my total raw data was only ~27GB in size (~1.5GB compressed). My experience in loading was very consistent for each subsequent year at between 4m12s and 4m20s for each complete year (concatenated the months into a single file) or around 2,560 seconds. The total record count was 70,097,260 records. Another way of saying that would be 273,817 records/second versus your experience of 13,244 records/second (117,023,290 records in 8,836 seconds) with the single-threaded loader provided in Infobright Community Edition, a ~20X improvement (on my server) and using the DDL below. The DDL is the other thing. When appropriate I used the COMMENT ‘LOOKUP’ attribute offered by Infobright to transparently convert repetitive text strings to internal, integer lookup values. This improves load times, compression on those columns, and query performance when one of these columns is used for filtering, joining or aggretating on. This is apparent in the improvements in response time for several of the queries above. The DDL I used is included below: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ontime; CREATE TABLE ontime( Year SMALLINT NOT NULL, — 1 Year Quarter TINYINT NOT NULL, — 2 Quarter (1-4) Month TINYINT NOT NULL, — 3 Month DayofMonth TINYINT NOT NULL, — 4 Day of Month DayOfWeek TINYINT NOT NULL, — 5 Day of Week FlightDate DATE NOT NULL, — 6 Flight Date (YYYY-MM-DD) [not (yyyymmdd)] UniqueCarrier CHAR(2) NOT NULL COMMENT ‘LOOKUP’, — 7 Unique Carrier Code.

I can see some crash reports in the monetdb forum, but no memory leak report, could you give me some advices? Did you encouter this problem when you run the benchmark? Thanks Reply Vadim says: December 23, 2009 at 11:39 pm Dear Frank, I am not expert in MonetDB, but Martin Kersten is. If he does not notice your question, I will pass it to him. Reply Martin Kersten says: December 24, 2009 at 12:45 am Dear Frank, Sounds as an error I would like to reconfirm (and solve if correct). Can you provide more information on this experiment on the MonetDB users’ list. monetdb-users@lists.sourceforge.net In particular, version used, platform characteristics, and experiment script. Reply Frank says: December 24, 2009 at 2:27 am Dear Vadim and Martin, Thanks for your quick reply, I have post my experiment to the MonetDB users’list. Reply Martin Kersten says: January 1, 2010 at 1:33 pm Dear all, This benchmark was a good exercise to re-prioritize some of our development efforts towards improvements for daily BI use. Although the original results were quite promising, we knew that low hanging fruit in the MonetDB stack was not harvested. A peek preview on the performance results for the next feature release can be found in http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport Happy newyear. Martin Reply Vadim says: January 1, 2010 at 10:06 pm Martin, That’s impressive. I can’t recall so fast response with performance fixes with significant improvements. Is that version available to download ? Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 5:47 pm First of all, I would like to thank Vadim and mysqlperformanceblog team for very interesting posts – I am a regular visitor of your web-site. In our company we are looking for D/W solution which will allow us to do a real-time (10-15 sec) queries on 1B+ row tables. InfoBright, MonetDB, InfiniDB are in my short lists. Having read your article first time I was impressed by performance numbers of columnar databases, but now … I think that there are a lot of room for query optimization inside both MonetDB and Infobright. For example, this query takes 7.9 sec for MonetDB and 12 sec for Infobright. -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC This is a full column scan query. Group BY column has very low cardinality (7) => do grouping and aggregation in memory. DayOfWeek requires only 3 bits per row => for 117M row table, it will need ~30Mb to store the whole column. Loading column from disk (30MB), decompressing it and aggregating 117M numbers should not take more than 1 sec (actually, I think I can do it on my laptop in less than 0.5 sec). Vadim, can you forward my e-mail address and question to MonetDB and Infobright guys? This is query: SELECT T.C FROM T WHERE (up to 4 simple filter conditions ANDed) ORDER BY T.B DESC LIMIT N; The good selectivity is not guaranteed. It may require almost full table scan in a worst case. Can they do this type of query under 15 sec in a worst case on 1B table which is similar to the table from this post (120 columns – most of them with low cardinality – no strings only numbers) Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 6:02 pm Forgot to mention YearD column in my example. Of course we need to scan through 2 columns, but both are with very low cardinality and must be very compressible ones. The second column will add possibly 60Mb more data to load from disk. Reply Vadim says: February 2, 2010 at 9:56 pm Vlad, I forwarded your question to my contacts in MonetDB and InfoBright. Reply Martin Kersten says: February 5, 2010 at 3:05 pm Dear Vlad, Sorry for the delay in answering your question regarding Q1 and compression. Bit-wise compression is a two-edge sword. You save on IO and pay with CPU cycles. The numbers reported for both MonetDB and Infobright on this blog already show that compression is just one ingredient in the equation. MonetDB used more diskspace and still performed very well. In http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport you find more recent numbers. In particular, Q1 runs currently within 1 sec on the 118M tuples. It is certainly worth trying out the 1B version using the upcoming Feb2010 release. Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 5, 2010 at 3:35 pm Thanks, Martin I will definitely give MonetDB a try. Reply itsme says: October 27, 2015 at 2:33 am hi Vadim, what’s king of software are you using to make picture graph ? thanks in advance 😉 Reply Eyal Rozenberg says: October 30, 2016 at 9:12 am For anyone who’s interested in this data and/or in these queries as a benchmark, I’ve created a github repository: https://github.com/eyalroz/usdt-ontime-tools for automating the download of the CSVs and the loading of the data – at least into MonetDB. The numbers have changed significantly since 2009 – but there are also schema changes because of what BTS provides; some make the schema ‘tighter’ – e.g. the fact that the decimal values are not really decimal, they always end with .00 and are really ints, so my loading script cleans them up; but on the other hand, you can’t rely on having exactly 6 chars in the tailnum, and sometimes it’s even missing entirely. I’ll be using this to try out some GPU decompression primitives. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Subscribe Want to get weekly updates listing the latest blog posts?

The company held an event Oct. 26, where it showcased devices such as the Surface Studio and Surface Book i7, but the Surface Pro 5 tablet was a no-show. The device is rumored to launch in spring 2017, after the Windows 10 Creators Update rolls out for existing devices. Will it replicate the success of the Surface Pro 4 for Microsoft? Will it have standout features similar to the recently launched devices? Well, it remains to be seen. Until Microsoft makes official announcements about what the Surface Pro 5 will have, here are some rumors and speculations about what the device may offer. Display Surface Pro 5 might feature a 4K/UHD display having a 3860 x 2560p display with the same 3:2 aspect ratio that Microsoft has been using since the Surface Pro 3. The existing model - the Surface Pro 4, comes with a 2736 x 1824p IPS LCD display with a pixel density of 267 ppi. A 4K display may cause a significant price bump and also eat into the battery life, so this feature might be limited to a top-end version of the device rather than coming on the standard Surface Pro devices. Processor Surface Pro 4 came with a Skylake processor inside, but the most popular rumor about the upcoming device is that it might come with the new Intel Kaby Lake Processors. The new processors have faster clock speed changes due to a 14 nanometer device architecture. The processor series is expected to offer better graphics support for devices. It is also notable that Intel is currently working on Cannonlake chips, but Kabylake is the one that Surface Pro 5 is expected to come with as Cannonlake might not ship before 2017. Stylus Support Stylus support is one of the standout features of the Surface Pro, so much so, that even competitor Apple decided to ship its iPad Pro with one. Microsoft's Stylus, called the Surface Pen, launched with the original Surface Pro and has been available with each upcoming model since 2012. The new Surface Pen is expected to be more pressure sensitive than the current one. USB-C support Microsoft might finally add USB-C support to the Surface Pro series, beginning with Surface Pro 5.

As more accessories get designed to work with USB-C, the company is expected to endow its upcoming tablet with a relevant port. Multiple device connection capability It is expected that Surface Pro 5 will allow multi-device usage seamlessly. Users might be able to connect other Windows 10 devices with it and work across devices easily. They could pick up work they have done on the Surface Pro 5 and continue it on another device. A patent filed Jun. 26 by Microsoft explains how users could access the keyboard, mouse, memory and OS from connected devices. The company already has a PC-smartphone connected device, the Continuum. If Surface Pro 5 comes with the same feature, it could get a leg up on competitors such as the Apple iPad Air 2.

Apple going all-in on USB-C for MacBooks is great for the future, but leaves us in dongle hell for now CNET 10/30/2016 Dong Ngo © Provided by CNET Josh Miller/CNET Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

Speeds will be so fast -- 5G and WiGig -- and the chipsets so cheap and plentiful that everything from your coffee maker to your garage door opener will have them embedded by default. Even your charging cable may go away, when and if we ever get a single wireless charging standard. In the meantime: you've got cables and wires. Lots of them. And they all probably fit into a different-shaped port. That's the world that Apple's new MacBook Pros are coming into. Ironically, after pulling the headphone jack from its iPhone 7, Apple left it in its new laptops. But aside from that old-fashioned 3.5mm jack, the only connector you'll find on Apple's latest and greatest laptops is USB-C. Depending on which model you choose, you get two or four of the tiny ports, all of which offer the Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth and connectivity. Apple's full-on embrace of Thunderbolt 3 is great. Thunderbolt 3 is extremely fast and versatile and really is the connection port of the future. On the other hand, we're still living in a present where port standards like HDMI, the SD card slot, and especially regular old USB-A ports -- those rectangular ones that have been around for 20 years or so -- are still widely used by the vast majority of devices. Which means, buying a MacBook Pro right now is to invest in a variety of adapters for all your legacy devices. But before we delve too deeply into the cons, let's take a closer look at the pros of this decision. One port, one cable for everything Last year Intel announced that Thunderbolt 3 would use the same port type as USB-C. Meaning that depending on the type of device connected to it, every Thunderbolt 3 port will also work as a USB-C port and every Thunderbolt 3 cable will work as a USB-C cable and vice versa (as long as you get a qualitative USB-C cable.) When working as Thunderbolt 3, the port delivers up to 40Gbps bandwidth and as USB-C, up to 10Gbps. Both types of connections allow for the delivery of data, audio and video, making it by far the fastest and most flexible peripheral port to date. Plug in a Thunderbolt 3 device to a new MacBook, and file transfer speeds will be so quick that the write speed of the storage will be the only thing holding you back. And with the right adapter, you can output video to HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort or pretty much anything else under the sun. It's also important to note that USB-C supports bidirectional charging. This means not only can you now can say goodbye the the MagSafe charging adapter on the new MacBooks, you can also use the laptop to charge any peripheral device connected to it or use a peripheral device to charge the laptop. So you really only need one power adapter, no matter how many devices you use with your laptop, including those that would normally require a separate power source, which is awesome. When Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are the only port types used in peripheral devices, you won't need to carry more than one type of cable with you. Just a few USB-C cables will connect everything. Just think about how convenient it is! Dongle and accessory madness But that future is still quite far away; for now, there are myriad peripheral devices that still require the USB-A connector (legacy standard USB), like portable drives, SD card readers, most smartphones and so on. This means you'll need to get an accessory or dongle adapter before you can use them. If the new laptops retained just one regular USB type-A port, this wouldn't be such a big deal and would greatly ease the pain of the transition. Keep in mind that this is the first time the MacBook Pro has gotten USB-C; prior to this the 12-inch MacBook was the only Apple computer that used USB-C. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc— Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 And the number of ports itself is also significant. Even in the case of the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models (13- and 15-inch), the ones with 4 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, that's still not enough ports to comfortably suit many people's needs. Just look at your computer right now and count how many things are currently plugged in. (And remember: there's no more MagSafe port, either; if you want to charge your new MacBook, a USB-C power cable will occupy one of those precious ports.) For me personally: a charging cable, a portable backup drive, a smartphone, an SD card, and a thumbdrive, and at times an external monitor. And while the new MacBooks compare pretty favorably to the MacBook Air (two USB, a Thunderbolt 2 port for external video, plus MagSafe charging, and 3.5mm headphone), they're a far cry from the previous (albeit still available) MacBook Pro 15-inch, which has a total of 7 ports (two USB, two Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, SD, MagSafe and headphone). For power users -- the very folks looking for a "Pro" laptop -- that's already limiting. The iPhone paradox However, it's iPhone users who'll suffer most. When the iPhone 7 was first announced, I was extremely disappointed by its lack of USB-C support -- Apple still opted to use its proprietary Lightning connector instead. And now this means that you can't connect the phone to any of the new MacBook Pros, without an adapter. You could skip the adapter and get Apple's Lightning to USB-C cable for $25. That will solve the connection problem, but then you'll need to carry at least two types of cables when traveling. So much for the future where only a single type of cable is necessary. (Apple didn't immediately reply to my request for comment on why it had made this decision.) This whole ordeal is rife with irony. With its computers, Apple is now one of the biggest supporters of USB-C. But at the same time, it bars its flagship smartphone from natively using this port, which just doesn't make sense to me. But even taking the iPhone out of the equation, the abrupt move -- from no USB-C on the MacBook Pros at all to going all USB-C and nothing else -- feels premature. Apple is treating a relatively distant future as if it were already here. And as a result it may have taken its shot way too soon.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home Reviews Cases, Cooling & PSU CPU Air Coolers Cooler Master MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU Cooler Review Cooler Master's MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU cooler is the first product to go under testing on our new cooler rig setup. So, let's see how it does. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Air Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: Oct 30, 2016 4:00 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 93%Manufacturer: Cooler Master Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [Cooler Master MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 7 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing     When it comes to the MASTERAIR series of coolers, up until this point, all we have for reference is the MASTERAIR Maker 8 CPU cooler from Cooler Master. This does not stop them from developing more coolers in this lineup, however, and is why we have you attention here today. However, where the Maker 8 has all of the bells and whistles for a single tower cooler, including dual fans, shrouds, LED lighting, plus the ability to have some of its parts replaced with 3D printed products, what has come forth since, is a bit more mundane.     This is not to say the last two coolers to sport the MASTERAIR naming are in any way sub par; they are just more economically friendly designs. For those who did not want to spend large on the MASTERAIR Maker 8 now have the option to select something which does not require you to dig as deep into your wallet. At the same time, they offer many features that make newer coolers a success in today's market. While these coolers may not be as fancy as the original, they offer things like an offset design to allow clearance around the socket, easy to use mounting hardware, and a clip on fan which makes changing the fans or cleaning them much easier.   Today we start with the smaller of the two options to be released. Cooler Master is setting forth a pair of new options in the MASTERAIR series, and we are covering the MASTERAIR PRO 3 here. This is a 92mm fan based cooler which sports a few new features as well as being capable of being installed in places where the standard 120mm fan cooler solutions will not fit. With our new test system all set and ready to go, we bring forth the first new cooler to be tested with it. Hopefully, by the time we are done with this review, you will have some appreciation for this very affordable air cooler from Cooler Master, and if space is of any concern to you, this may just be a solid solution to suit your needs as well.     We copied this chart from the packaging on the MASTERAIR PRO 3 as it has yet to be released at the time we are writing this review. On the packaging, we see things start off with a full list of compatibility for both Intel and AMD, which covers all of the Intel line and most of the AMD sockets as well. The MASTERAIR PRO 3, all told, stands 140mm tall, it is 117mm wide, and is just 78mm in depth, with the fan incorporated in these measurements. As far as materials are concerned, there are three copper heat pipes which are 6mm in diameter, there is aluminum with exposed copper heat pipes in the CDC 2.0 base design, and of course, this cooler uses aluminum for the 41 fins including the top fin which has been anodized black.   The fan which is included with the MASTERAIR PRO 3 is a 92mm fan sporting the FD09225M12LPC model number, and it includes a switch that can be set to silent or quiet modes. The speed of this fan ranges from 650 to 3000 RPM, and it can deliver 28 CFM of air flow and 2.5 mmH2O of pressure at its maximum speed. With light use of this fan, you can expect a lifetime of 350,000 hours, but if left at its maximum speed, the lifespan is reduced to just 50,000 hours. This 92mm fan is rated to deliver a range of noise from 6 dBA on the low-end to a maximum of 30dBA. It is a 4-pin PWM powered fan which can draw 12V but sips power with just 0.1 A of power draw, using 1.2W. All told, this cooler weighs in at 503.5 grams with the fan included, but what is refreshing is that this MASTERAIR PRO 3 ships with a five-year warranty to cover it.   As we write this review, the MASTERAIR PRO 3 is not yet available at any retail locations. In various emails that came along with our agreement for a launch day review, we have the MSRP information. We are told that to obtain this smaller single tower air cooler, you will only need to come up with $39.99 to get one shipped to your door. It is rare that we run across coolers which cost less than $50, but the MASTERAIR PRO 3 from Cooler Master is such a cooler. With an affordable price point, the newly designed Continuous Direct Contact 2.0 base design offering 45 percent more contact with the CPU, things are looking up for this cooler.   Stick with us as we get a good look at what Cooler Master is offering with the MASTERAIR PRO 3, and as we complete the testing, we will deliver our verdict on whether or not this compact single tower design is something that is worthy of your attention, and something you just cannot live without.

But technology inherently demands change — and that change is demanded at the fastest rate possible. We can complain about it all day long, but if we stop complaining at the whims of our feelings and start thinking logically, we can and should start to feel better as we realize the true nature of our so-called upgrade-cycle and innovation-searching frustrations. In reality, the only thing lacking innovation is our expectation. Media loves nothing more than punchy headlines. Headlines that claim Apple is on its way down and can’t innovate as Microsoft looks to beat it at its own game are nothing more than journalist-sanctioned click-bait gold, but make little sense for those actually interested in good journalism. Sure, the Microsoft Surface Studio is flashy with its new rotating input device, but how practical is it, really, compared to other options that are or will become available? Time will tell, but as pretty and fun and swanky as it looks, there are a number of aspects to the device that make this one seem more like a gimmick than anything else. I'm not yet sold. Sure, it could end up being amazing. But I'm not yet convinced that the Surface Studio's new Dial is that much better than other already-existing input devices. For those that want more dial-like controls, we've already had fully modular and customizable options such as Palette. A Short and General History Apple has a history not of being first to the market with various technologies, but of bringing features we need only when the technology to implement them is ready (though we, ourselves, are often not quite ready). The Mac was far from the first desktop personal computer. The iPhone was far from the first smartphone. The iPad was far from the first tablet. But Apple launched each of these products with features that made perfect sense in the time and technological environment in which they were born. The same thing happened with feature changes within these product lines. As data port technologies such as USB and Thunderbolt matured and improved, technology had to adopt these changes eventually. In some cases, Apple waited (such as with the advent of USB 3.0) for the peripheral market to catch up. In other cases (such as with the DVD drive and the iPhone’s headphone jack), Apple brazenly led the charge in ridding the world of a fading technology in favor of better, modern technologies. No matter how you look at it, Apple's newest laptops are sleek, powerful, envy-worthy computers. The trade-offs to make for them require nothing different from anything else we've been doing. We're just going to need a few different cables than the ones we currently have. These changes aren’t always easy to swallow, but Apple’s proven track record of doing what makes sense to give the world a little nudge forward should earn it a little slack. Many of Apple’s biggest fans chastised the company for dropping the DVD drive with the Retina MacBook Pro. And yet, looking back, Apple made this decision at the perfect time. Since Netflix and Amazon and iTunes have done such a great job of filling in the media market, no one actually needed a DVD drive anymore. Software was quickly becoming online-only (subscription-based software was yet another trend around the corner). And the DVD drive was obsolete. We just didn’t know it, yet. But Apple did. And we should trust Apple to know what it’s doing today. Lack of Innovation The entire “Can Apple innovate without Jobs?” question is a tired one. Unfortunately for the company, it’s hard to innovate when everyone is looking for ways to prove you’re not. But what is innovation? Some of us want to be wowed by another product category or a completely new type of electronic, as the iPhone was at the time of its introduction. The only problem with that is that, again, the iPhone wasn’t that new. It was just the best incarnation of a device we’d been using for quite some time. It might seem rough to trivialize something that revolutionized the smartphone industry and changed our lives in such a big way. But it’s true. It didn’t invent how we spoke. And the entire idea of the device was to be the last portable electronic device we needed. So why are we still searching for something new and different that we don’t need? The iPad is a great example of this. Everyone wants a new product, and Apple gives it to them in the form of the iPad. And yet, everyone complains that the iPad isn’t necessary. And if they like the iPad, they complain that the portable computer is no longer necessary. In reality, this should all be OK without the need for complaints. Not everyone needs one device or another. The iPhone is designed to be and should be the only one-device-fits-all product. As for the rest, make your decision, buy what you need, and enjoy the rest of your life without freaking out if or when something new comes out. The New MacBook Pros and System Performance Of course, technology still needs to move forward. And it’s fair to expect regular updates as technology improves. Apple did wait quite some time to introduce new laptops this time around, but the reality is that Intel took quite some time to release new processors that would make it worth the upgrade. They even announced an entire change in the rate at which they would progress with their manufacturing processes. How much thinner do people expect it to get? Still, if we pause to take a look at what Apple really accomplished in these new computers, it’s hard to see how they aren’t amazing. They’re thinner than and as light as a MacBook Air, but perform at levels good enough to edit 4K video, run multiple 5K screens, and transfer data at more than three gigabytes per second — more than six times the rate of most of today’s high-end solid state drives. Battery life remains unchanged, and we get up to four, lightning-fast, state-of-the-art Thunderbolt 3 ports that can handle anything you throw at them with greater expandability and flexibility than any other port — ever. And if you want to complain about processor speed or other specs, just remember numbers aren’t everything (this iPhone versus Galaxy test shows how great hardware-software integration can make lower-featured devices outperform those that feature over-killed specifications). Sure, there are some caveats. You need to get an adapter or two for most of your devices (for now). The SD card slot is missing. And there’s no dedicated HDMI out. But can we be real about the practicality of these features for just a moment? None of this is anything new. Ports have been improving and changing rapidly in the last 10 years. We already need, have, and use cables between all of our peripherals. What’s the difference between using a few different cables than the ones we have? Soon enough, our peripherals will ship with the same ports, too, and all of this will be a distant memory. The SD card isn’t necessarily going to be as ubiquitous as we think it is. The organization that manages the Compact Flash standard threw its support behind the XQD format with the newly announced CFexpress format to likely be backwards-compatible with XQD. For the professionals such as a lot of us that really need fast transfer rates, our cameras support a variety of different technologies (from CFAST to CF to SD and XQD), so many of us are using separate, dedicated readers anyway. And for a good chunk of the general public, most consumer cameras feature wireless image transfer, which will only become more and more common with time. The absence of the SD card slot is Apple's way of saying, "It just won't matter for that much longer, anyway." And HDMI out? Really? I could have gone without this port a lot sooner, especially considering the frequency with which I actually used it. Thunderbolt 3 and the way that it paves for the future is brighter than any of these. Now, everyone has the flexibility and expandability for anything they could ever want. Your I/O ports are no longer suited to only a handful of people who happen to need those exact ports just perfectly. Everyone has the ability to get one adapter that perfectly suits them. Apples and Oranges Getting back to Microsoft and its supposed overshadowing of Apple’s keynote event, Microsoft’s greatest innovation is simply the fact that it made another computer and is continuing to make them in general. As great of a job as their team did with the sturdiness of the design and the implementation the true-to-life display size (12-point font on the screen of the Microsoft Surface Studio is the same size as when printed on a sheet of paper), it’s just a big touchscreen desktop with a new input device from which only professional designers will really benefit. The Surface Studio is beautiful, but it's not any more of a game-changer than any other new-ish computer out there. Hewlett-Packard released the TouchSmart back in 2007. This is just better (as it should be, by now). Meanwhile, the comparison between the two rivals’ events is moot, since so many seem to forget the fact that Microsoft is releasing a professional desktop for designers while Apple is releasing portable notebooks fit for anyone that wants a step up to the on-the-go power-user. The two devices are in completely different categories. Naturally, desktop fans are still waiting for Apple to revamp the iMac — and rightly so. The iMac, too, hasn’t seen a meaningful update in far too long. And I won’t get you all started on the lack of refreshes for the Mac Pro. But with new processor releases from Intel around the corner, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s more to follow soon. Not at all to take away from Microsoft, but to sit around and say Apple is slacking and Microsoft is blowing away the competition is absurd. Look at the performance really being offered and the subsequently improved portability. It’s impressive — period. In a few months, the media will likely sing the same song — at least until Apple can please its investors with record profits once again, as is largely expected next quarter. Yet the general public will be more or less silently loving their new MacBook Pros because they really are the best computers around. Meanwhile, for PC lovers, Microsoft is doing a great job of producing some competition-worthy computers for its professional users. Why is everyone in such a hurry to get in another fight over all of this? Posted In:  Fstoppers Originals Gear Opinion Follow Adam works mostly across California on all things photography and art.

The New Microsoft Surface Studio Looks Amazing Astrophotographers Rejoice: Apple's iOS 10 Includes Color Filters to Make Your Screen Completely Red Log in or register to post comments 109 Comments Mike Leland - October 31, 2016 I love the 4 USB ports. I also am in my 40s and remember the transition from parallel ports and serial ports to ps2 ports to USB-A ports. I remember when people were up in arms about manufacturers dropping serial ports from their machines in favor of universal serial (USB) USB-C is way more universal and way more awesomer. 16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed. 3 -1 0 -8 Since you didn't say which system only has 16gb RAM (its RAMM btw) I'll make a wild guess you meant the Surface Studio. The top of the libe 17 version comes with 32Gb od RAMM.. But Apple being Apple and dropping the industry standard hmdi/vga/usb video outputs, has now pissed of EVERY business person who has to do presentations and meetings with no way to plug into or access any company's media projector or display. Apple falls on its face in the real world of business. kris risner - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff He meant the Macbook... 5 0 g coll - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff "RAM (its RAMM btw)" What are you taking about? 3 0 Lane Shurtleff - October 31, 2016 g coll My mistake. I confused it with SO-DIMM. RAM or SDRAM is correct. 4 0 Mike Leland - October 31, 2016 Lane Shurtleff So, yeah. Since I was busy all day doing photo shoots (this is a site for photographers, right?) I am just now getting back to a little free time. Yes, I was referring to the macbook pro referenced in the post I had replied to and prefaced with "4 USB ports". How was that not obvious? (Also, thank you, kris risner) Not, it is not "RAMM", its RAM. Seriously? Does it stand for Random Access Memory or Random Access Memory Motherfucker? Is "Lane Shurleff" actually Jules Winnfield? (thanks, g coll) I am a business person as I run an incredibly successful photography business (this it a site for photographers, right?) and I have NO PROBLEM with buying a laptop that has THE NEW STANDARD USB PORTS so that when I go to plug in to a boardroom system in 6 months that only has USB-C inputs, I won't have to make excuses for living in the past. Lane, I know that you admitted to your mistake 3 hours ago but I feel like I should give you a hard time since you were so quick to (incorrectly) give me a hard time over a clearly pedantic element of my comment. I felt it necessary to bring this up as your reply clearly illustrates the fact that I poorly communicated my position to you. So I'll lay it out to you in plain english: I'm mad that the new macbook pro only has 16gb of ram. Or rammmmm.... whatever. I need to get ready for tomorrow's shoots. You can get ready for your board meeting or whatever it is that you do. 4 -4 Leigh Smith - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland Pat yourself on the back a few more times about your photoshoots, and being a photographer. 8 -2 Cesar Sales - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith ikr 2 -2 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith Will do, cupcake... 2 -1 Paolo Defilipis - November 1, 2016 Leigh Smith You're sad that this guy makes high profile photo shoots and you don't? Jealousy? Let's all just be friend instead, ok? 0 -1 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Paolo Defilipis Ehhh I wouldn't go there, buddy. I think he just misunderstood why I prefaced my statement with the fact that I'm a photographer. It was because the person I was replying to was talking about non photography related uses of the laptop and I was trying to make a point that the context of my original post mattered only to photography related uses and that this is a photography site, not a "business" site. But thank you, anyway. Yes, I would love for everyone here to be friends! 1 -1 Leigh Smith - November 2, 2016 Mike Leland But doing presentations is very photography related. I was at a gallery talk the other day where the photographer was trying to find the right adaptor for the projector. 1 -1 Artistic iQ - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland I love it MIKE!! 😂👍💯... Random Access Memory Motherfckr!!!!! 2 -1 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Artistic iQ Thanks man. I'm glad that someone caught the humor in my post. Apparently it wasn't all that popular. Too many armchair quarterbacks in here, I guess... 1 -2 B In SEA - November 1, 2016 Mike Leland "16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed." It was a battery life decision. The Intel processors they chose to use only work with the 3rd gen low power ram, which only can go up to 16gb ram. I would prefer higher power components and using a thicker body to make up the battery life, but that's the decision they made. Next update to this body will get new processors and ram that can go to 32gb, I guess they're sacrificing some in this first iteration so that the 2nd and 3rd iteration of this form factor will be pretty ideally balanced. 4 0 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 B In SEA That makes perfect sense. It stinks but it is what it is, I guess. I would also take a slightly thicker body for a more powerful machine. Heck, my last MBP was a 17" behemoth. 1 0 Isidro Lopez - November 3, 2016 B In SEA Yes, it was a battery life issue. Apple is using only power efficient components in these machines now. They have sold the idea of "all day battery life" even though we all know that would mean using one program with the backlight off. You're much better off with an iMac at this point. 0 0 Matt Nikkel - November 1, 2016 [Edited] Mike Leland I think the distinction is that USB was a lot more mature when Apple started completely ditching all those other ports than USB-C is now. The ports had been showing up on machines for a few years alongside the legacy ports, and a lot of people already had at least some USB devices when Apple made that switch. While I agree that USB-C is the future, it's still completely in it's infancy. It's also not really a viable replacement for either the MagSafe adapter or an SD slot. There's no reason this needs to be exclusively USB-C. Two USB-C, a USB 3.0, an SD slot, and a magsafe power cord would have made just as clean looking machine and would have been infinitely more functional for 99% of their potential customers. 4 0 Mike Leland - November 1, 2016 Matt Nikkel Magsafe would be nice. USB 3.0 is easy peasy. There are $2 adapters that are less than an inch long that cleanly convert any USB-A male to a USB-C male. SD card slot would be good for a lot of people. I don't have any use for them since I don't use cameras that have SD slots. I may be in the minority, there. I understand why they removed them, though, since we are also in a transition with card technology. 1 0 Brian Corrigan - November 2, 2016 Mike Leland Well, Mike, I have to agree with your assessment(s), but I hate having to agree with a guy in his 40's who feels compelled to use the word "retarded." Really? 0 -1 Mike Leland - November 2, 2016 Brian Corrigan Why does the word "retarded" bother you? It is a technically accurate description of the computer being available with only 16GB RAM when other computers have 32GB and 64GB options. It means that the advancement of the computer has been delayed held back. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 3, 2016 Mike Leland Are you serious?! It's one thing to be offensive with the use of the word, it's another to be intellectually dishonest about your use of the word. You said, "16gb RAM is retarded, though. I would really like to see this addressed." I think we all know what you meant. You should quit while you're behind. We'll take your feeble, backtracking explanation as an admission of guilt, and we forgive you. We would ask that you refrain from using offensive language. This forum and the world will be better for it. 0 -2 Mike Leland - November 3, 2016 Brian Corrigan Ahahaha! Whatever. I can say what I want. 16gb of RAM is retarded. If that offends you, go find a safe space and stay off the internet. 1 -1 Brian Corrigan - November 4, 2016 Mike Leland Yes, you can say what you want. And you did. And I pity you. 1 0 Isidro Lopez - November 3, 2016 Brian Corrigan You sound like an easily offended millenial with mommy issues. Or maybe you have multiple personality disorder since you refer to yourself as "we". You don't speak for all of us in this forum mr brian corrigan. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 4, 2016 Isidro Lopez Mr. Isidro Lopez. I happen to be a father of a 22-year-old son with intellectual disabilities who is struggling to make it in this world. And while I'm not easily offended, I am offended when one chooses to use the word "retarded" when they really mean something like stupid, ignorant, short-sided, foolish, etc. You and Mr. Leland clearly view individuals with intellectual disabilities as stupid, ignorant, short-sided and foolish. My son, and those like him, are none of those things. You two, however, are all of those things. We, yes WE, pity both of you. There is really nothing more to be said. Quit while you're behind (although I suspect you won't be able to help yourself). Carry on. It's not wise to get into a battle of wits with fools. I'm going to go take some pictures. Let's just all do that, shall we? 1 -1 Isidro Lopez - November 4, 2016 Brian Corrigan Wow, so having a loved one with intellectual disabilities gives you the right to bully people on the internet? You think it's ok to tell me that I view individuals with intellectual disabilities as stupid? My sister is DS but that doesn't mean I go around and take it out on other people. I don't search websites for keywords so that I can make people feel sorry for me. You have serious issues, asshole. 0 0 Brian Corrigan - November 5, 2016 Isidro Lopez Given the choice to do nothing, do the right thing, or double down on ignorance, you chose to double down on ignorance. Why am I not surprised. I really feel sorry for your sister who has to put up with such ignorance from her own brother. It's too bad you chose to defend a guy who uses the word "retarded" in a manner that he admits was intended as an insult. If you can't see that, then you have an issue with reading comprehension. And quit trying to play the "bully" victim....it is unbecoming. Sheesh. There is really nothing more to be said. You and your buddy have really said it all. Now let's go take some pictures. 0 0 Isidro Lopez - November 5, 2016 Brian Corrigan Here's a baking forum for you to go bully people in. Have fun telling all of these bread bakers what awful mean, fools they are for using proper terminology that hurts your feelings. http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30767/shaping-cold-retarded-dough 0 0 8 0 Just a correction, the AiO is Surface Studio which the Apple equivalent is the iMac or more akin to HP's Z1 series, and the direct competitor to the Macbook Pro is the Surface Book. The Surface Pro is the 2-in-1 Tablet which is what the iPad Pro mimics. Also you along with many other people have missed the message about the Surface line. Surface isn't to compete with Apple or more importantly against MS's partners and OEMs instead it's about creating new categories and challenging people's perceptions about computers can do. Look at what the Surface Pro did, tablets wasn't new but what was missing was interactivity. Now 3 years later 2-in-1s are the only PC market not cratering by lack of sales, even tablets have flat lined or crashed. The Surface Studio was created based on feedback from professionals, as was the new Surfacebook. Something Apple has never done, you get what Apple thinks what you need. You mentioned the Surface Dial, yet neglect to mention the Touchstrip on the Macbook Pro which is more convenient? Which will be more practical? Time will tell, but the Dial has several historical precedents and is a proven technology (Nulooq, 3D Connexion etc) and Wacom uses a radial dial. Using a Dial will require you learn some new tricks to improve your workflow, and it will be compatible with all Windows devices but the onscreen support will be limited to Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and Surface Studio. As with any new peripheral such as the Wacom tablet you get what you put in. For reference I use a 3D Connexion Space Pilot to help me use Photoshop instead of hunting for keys when retouching skin between that and the Intuous it covers about 75% of the tools I need without having to go the keyboard. As to ports being removed, most Apple users tend to ignore the inconveniences of having dozens of cables, essential peripherals (negating the reduced weight ) and so on just to use macOS. Whereas Windows computers get vilified for every little fault in the media. Plus Thunderbolt suffers the same fault of Firewire, it's just too expensive considering how ubiquitous USB is, and there's barely any USB-C devices out there at present, and you're looking at least 2-3 years before they get to be as common. The problem with Apple and why there is so many negative headlines is that they've been hostile to professional users and not listening to them, they've been laser focused on iOS and neglecting macOS. iOS is flat lining. I'm not saying Apple is doomed far from it, they have some of the largest reserves in the industry but unless they start listening to the market that kept them going then people will leave especially if you get companies starting to copy the likes of Surface Studio. However between Apple and MS you'd expect Apple to come up with the next big thing, historically they have. Instead what do you have at present? MS is basically forcing everyone to stand up and watch, it started with the Surface Pro, then they announced one of the biggest surprises in the industry: Hololens, then it was Surfacebook and now Surface Studio. MS isn't designing for today, they are designing for the future. Final point, MS has the biggest R&D budget far exceeding that of Apple that's why they've been able to produce the Surface line and Hololens of which some of the technology has been in development for over 6 years. Here's a short overview of an actual user of Surface Studio, not a photographer but an illustrator. https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2016/10/26/the-surface-studio Oh and good luck getting a Surface Studio if you want one, you won't get one this side of Xmas as they've sold out and they are low production systems unlike iMacs which are mass produced. That really underscores the difference between the ideologies. Edit: Amended device name.

The package was originally created by a collaboration between Intel and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI). To reduce verbosity, we may refer to the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit using the BrainIAK abbreviation. Whenever lowercase spelling is used (e.g., Python package name), we use brainiak. Requirements We support Linux and MacOS with Python version 3.4 or higher. Most of the dependencies will be installed automatically. However, a few need to be installed manually. Linux Install the following packages (Ubuntu 14.04 is used in these instructions): apt install build-essential cmake libgomp1 mpich python3-dev python3-pip
 Install updated version of the following Python packages: pip3 install --user -U pip virtualenv
 Note the --user flag, which instructs Pip to not overwrite system files. You must add $HOME/.local/bin to your $PATH to be able to run the updated Pip, e.g., by adding the following line to $HOME/.profile and launching a new login shell (e.g., logout or execute bash -l): PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
 MacOS Install the Xcode Command Line Tools: xcode-select --install
 Install brew from https://brew.sh. If you already have brew, examine the output of the following command to make sure it is working: brew doctor
 Then install the following: brew install llvm cmake mpich python3
 You must instruct programs to use this clang version at /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin. One way to do this, which works for most programs, is setting the CC environment variable. You can add the following lines to $HOME/.profile (or $HOME/.bash_profile, if you have one). For them to take effect, you must logout or launch a new login shell, e.g., bash -l: export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
 In addition, you also need to specify the directories that the newly installed clang will seek for compiling and linking: export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include $CPPFLAGS"
 Install updated versions of the following Python packages: pip3 install -U pip virtualenv
 Installing The Brain Imaging Analysis Kit is available on PyPI: pip3 install -U brainiak
 Note that you may see a Failed building wheel for brainiak message (issue #61). Installation will proceed despite this failure. You can safely ignore it as long as you see Successfully installed at the end. Documentation The documentation is available at pythonhosted.org/brainiak. Contributing We welcome contributions.

 BMW will reportedly release an electric SUV in 2021 Danielle Muoio Oct. 31, 2016, 2:28 PM 1,476 facebook linkedin twitter email print BMW's hybrid, the i3. Reuters/Kim Kyung Hoon BMW is planning to launch its electric SUV, the i5, in 2021. Automobile Mag first reported in August that BMW was working on Project iNext: the German automaker's commitment to release an all-electric car with self-driving capabilities by 2021. But Autocar reported for the first time on Monday that the Project iNext car will be an electric SUV. Autocar cites sources who say that BMW has settled on an SUV bodystyle for its next model to accommodate the size of a battery pack without compromising on the car's proportions. BMW also settled on an SUV because it appeals to a segment with greater demand and profit margins than hatchbacks, according to the sources. "We conceived the i brand to work for the long term," Ian Robertson, BMW’s head of sales and marketing, told Autocar. "The electric car market is emerging but we see enough to be confident that consumers are understanding what it is about. What’s more, 80% of i customers are new to BMW.” Robertson declined to comment on whether or not the Project iNext car will be an SUV to Autocar. BMW did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. BMW's Project iNext car will be fully autonomous by 2025, according to the Automobile Mag report. BMW said it will launch its self-driving vehicles in China in 2021. The company is working with Mobileye, a former Tesla Autopilot supplier, and Intel to develop its self-driving vehicles. BMW is also working to complete a ride-sharing program for driverless cars by 2021, Wired reported.  BMW is expected to roll out the first electric version of its Mini car in 2019, followed by an electric version of its BMW X3 in 2020, Bloomberg reported in September. A competitive space Mercedes' electric SUV concept, the EQ. Screenshot BMW isn't the only automaker looking to enter the electric car space with an SUV. Mercedes-Benz showed off its electric SUV concept, the EQ, at the Paris Motor Show, with plans to release a production version of the car in 2019. Audi and Hyundai are also both planning on rolling out an all-electric SUV by 2018. Volkswagen is planning to roll out five electric vehicles by 2020, with more than one of those likely to be a crossover or SUV of some kind. And Volvo aims to offer at least two all-electric vehicles by 2019, one of which is expected to be a crossover or SUV. Tesla also has plans for an electric SUV, the Model Y. Chevy's SUV crossover, the Bolt, will hit dealerships before the end of the year. Pursuing an electric SUV at a time where EV sales have yet to gain traction could be the best move for automakers right now. This is because sales of smaller passenger vehicles continue to fall, while truck and SUV sales have stayed strong.  Meanwhile, electric cars make up roughly 1% of global auto sales. So going after the booming SUV segment could trigger demand in a space that has yet to gain traction with consumers.

Tag Heuer launched its Connected smartwatch some time back, it sells for $1,500 but if you’re not content with spending that kind of money perhaps you would like to spend $9,900 on the rose gold model of the same smartwatch. It’s very much the same Tag Heuer Connected smartwatch that the Swiss watchmaker launched about a year back so there’s nothing fundamentally different about the rose gold version aside from the fact that it costs as much as a car. The case and lugs of this particular version are made out of 18K rose gold. Inside the case you’ll find the same dualcore processor by Intel coupled with 1GB RAM and a 410mAh battery on the $1,500 model. It goes without saying that the average customer won’t be picking up this smartwatch, the average customer might not even pick up a $1,500 smartwatch, this is really only for those who have the money to be flashy in that manner. If I were one of those customers, I’d rather spend $9,900 on a proper mechanical watch from Tag Heuer finished in rose gold, it will surely hold its value better and would be a more sensible choice. The Tag Heuer Connected will be available from the company’s authorized dealers starting this fall. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about smartwatches.

The article started off with my distaste for buzzwords and phrases, but this one phrase, which was relatively new at the time, seemed to be a formidable trend, if there is such a thing. That phrase was “the cloud.” Back then, it didn’t seem like much to me, but in late 2011, I started designing AV systems that moved all their content via IP, and were controlled entirely via IP. Hence, the article. It finally made sense to me. Buying multiple devices that each housed their own processor and memory chipsets for every aspect of system functionality seemed crazy, when software running on a failover-protected server with bulk processing and memory can simply be the mechanism that accomplishes the goals of an AV system. That’s a long sentence, but it sums up that 2011 article very well. Now, fast forward to 2016. These days, IP-based media distribution is commonplace, and IP-based control is a usual occurrence. The transformation from proprietary control and distribution has morphed into the mainstream methodology of system design, which prepares the landscape for a final chapter in the transition to a more “cloud-centric” set of solutions for the AV industry at large. But what does that look like? First, having a piece of hardware for switching and routing will likely be standards-based network infrastructure. The days of large, half-rack-sized chassis switches are dwindling as manufacturers develop better forms of compression and continue to reduce latency. Furthermore, networking equipment manufacturers continue to develop products that can send and receive larger and larger amounts of data… faster. Second, we’re seeing the offspring of CobraNet grow up to be serious players in the digital audio networking world. I’m talking about audio networking protocols such as Dante, AVB, Ravenna, Q-LAN, and BLU link, just to name a few. With the advent of AES-67, most of these have started gravitating toward interoperability. Third, there are an increasing number of USB-based products finding their way into the professional AV ecosystem. Some provide a professional-grade “bridge” between the PC world and the AV world. Others aim to eliminate the bridge and port directly to PCs via IP with bridging built into them. The AV world is rapidly becoming an extension of the computer world. Coming in fourth, and coincidentally, what I see as the most important phenomenon, is the use of standard operating systems, such as Linux and commercially available chipsets from manufacturers such as Intel or SanDisk, in a variety of products for DSP-based audio processing, which happens to have horsepower and ample memory to spare for other tasks, such as system control, media archiving, streaming, playback, administration, monitoring, document storage, and any other number of future functionalities. What if we took this fourth phenomenon, paired it with network-based control, threw in a side order of network-based media distribution and routing, and then parked it in the cloud or in a bank of “on-prem” servers? Systems could self-commission, interlink in new ways, monitor themselves, actively repair themselves, store documentation, assist in decision making, schedule themselves, and perform on levels we have only begun to understand. The result would be a new, leaner, meaner, and more capable AV industry that would have to discover an entirely new set of revenue-generation schemes. There will always be plates, panels, cables, mounts, displays, amplifiers, loudspeakers, and some projectors, but the stuff in between will vaporize into the cloud. We must all begin the process of preparing to monetize this new, “cloudy” paradigm. Joey D’Angelo (joseph.dangelo@qsc.com) is a director of systems solutions at QSC. He is always looking for professional challenges, can wire or fabricate anything, and plays many instruments. Flashback: The 2011 Forecast Sadly, the use of the buzzword “collaboration” is still with us, but something else is dethroning it as of late: “The cloud.” At first, I just thought, “Oh brother, here’s another buzzword, and why would it apply to AV?” I was asked to write about this trend several times in the last six months. I did my research, and delved in as usual. Most often I kept saying, “I don’t think it’s applicable, because we can do networked control and it’s not a big deal worthy of cloud computing architecture!” Well gentlemen and gentlewomen, I stand before you today being a truly reformed individual with a new paradigm, and I can honestly say that these darn “clouds” are going to revolutionize our industry. Here’s why… —J.D.

The entry-level model, powered by a Skylake-based 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, currently has an average multi-core score of 6,970, indicating the notebook is only up to 7% faster than the early 2015 base model 13-inch MacBook Pro. Last year's comparable model, equipped with a Broadwell-based 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, currently has an average multi-core score of 6,497. The late 2016 model is also slightly faster than last year's mid-range 13-inch MacBook Pro, while slightly outperformed by the higher-end model. The notebooks are each calibrated against a baseline score of 4,000, which is the score of Intel's high-end Core i7-6600U processor. While the performance improvements are negligible, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar's 15-watt chip is more energy efficient than the 28-watt chip in last year's entry-level model. The lower power consumption gives the 2016 base model comparable battery life to last year's model despite having a smaller 54.5-watt-hour battery versus the 74.9-watt-hour battery in last year's comparable. Given that the non-Touch Bar model's 6360U chip would typically be appropriate for the MacBook Air, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar should be a more accurate comparable to last year's base 13-inch model. However, it is also $500 more expensive. Benchmarks for that model should be available next month when Apple begins shipping the Touch Bar notebooks to customers.

Currently: No word about leaving MagSafe behind, no logic for the non-industry-standard audio output on iPhone 7, not a word about the MBP's headphone jack (probably too scared to mention), ... Jobs' explanations were also fabulous: "The problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40 there." talking about plastic keyboards on 'smart' phones during iPhone's introduction. Explanations we now get are 'courage' or Ive's 'making it thinner, lighter and more powerful' that's conflicting with adding a touch screen for example (MR post today). Change triggers natural resistance and needs reasons to be accepted. Apple doesn't explain=sell their changes/choices any longer.

Rating: 25 Votes BootsWalking 2 weeks ago Performance per watt is much higher but is offset by a lower clock speed and a smaller battery. The net result is a thinner and lighter notebook that is about the same speed as last year's with no improvement in battery life. Not sure how many users will find value in the upgrade from the 2015 model - might appeal to those with earlier models though, who were due for an upgrade anyway. Rating: 24 Votes Ghost31 2 weeks ago Well, this model really replaces the 13-inch Air, not the 13-inch Pro. So a fairer comparison is against the 2.2 GHz MacBook Air, which scored 6561 in Geekbench. 6.2% boost. Not if you're calling it a "pro". Saying 'it replaces the air' doesn't really mean anything when you've jacked up the price and called it a pro.

The new coolers to the MasterAir series implore Cooler Master’s Continuous Direct Contact Technology 2.0, which basically increases the surface area by 45% by compressing heatpipes together, which helps to dissipate heat more efficiently.  Included with the Pro 3 is a single 92mm fan, rated for 28 CFM @ 2.5 mmH2O and a max noise level of 30 dBA.  The Pro 4 includes a single 120mm fan, rated for 66.7 CFM @ 2.34 mmH2O and a max noise level of 30 dBA as well.  Installation was designed to be made easier with an X-bracket, which you basically slide to your socket’s setting, or you can use the same installation method that the stock Intel cooler uses with the push-pin. MasterAir Pro 4 is a decently larger cooler compared to the Pro 3.  One feature that you will notice is that the Pro 3 has three heatpipes while the Pro 4 has four. The MSRP price difference between both of the coolers is very minimal, and they’re quite affordable period.  You will be able to pick up the MasterAir Pro 3 for $39.99 or less and the MasterAir Pro 4 for $44.99 or less.  Both coolers feature a 5-year warranty! SPECIFICATIONS MasterAir Pro 3 MasterAir Pro 4 Model MAY-T3PN-930PK-R1 MAY-T3PN-930PK-R1 CPU Socket Intel® LGA 2011-v3 / 2011 / 1151 / 1150 / 1155 / 1156  / 1366 / 775 AMD AM3+ / AM3 / AM2+ /AM2 / FM2+ / FM2 / FM1 Dimensions (LxWxH) 78x117x140mm 84x129x158.5mm Heat Sink Dimensions (LxWxH) 61.5x108x140mm 60x116x158.5mm Heat Sink Material 3 Heat Pipes / CDC 2.0 / Aluminum Fins 4 Heat Pipes / CDC 2.0 / Aluminum Fins Heat Sink Weight 390 g 472 g Fan Dimensions 92 x 92 x 25 mm 120 x 120 x 25 mm Fan Speed 650 – 3,000 RPM (PWM) ± 10% 650 – 2,000 RPM (PWM) ± 10% Fan Air Flow 28 CFM (Max) 66.7 CFM (Max) Fan Air Pressure 2.5 mmH2O (Max) 2.34 mmH2O (Max) Fan MTTF 350,000 hours 490,000 hours Fan L-10 Life 50,000 hours 70,000 hours Fan Connector 4-Pin Fan Noise Level 6~30 dBA (Max) Fan Rated Current 0.1 A 0.15A Fan Safety Current 0.2 A 0.4A Fan Power Consumption 1.2w 1.8 W   Both of these coolers look really nice and appear relatively simple to install, but we will find that out in later sections.  First, let’s take a look at how these coolers are packaged and take a quick look at them.

The programme, the company’s second Global Community of Innovation (GCI) fund, is open to partners at home and abroad who will work alongside Kuang-Chi, Ruopeng Liu, the chairman of Kuang-Chi said in Shenzhen, with an emphasis on innovative and disruptive companies with big potential. The fund will invest between US$1 million to US$15 million in emerging technology companies valued at US$5 million to US$200 million, focusing on robotics, aviation, virtual reality/augmented reality, telecommunications, internet of things and digital health. Founded in 2010, Kuang-Chi started as an electronic materials and communication equipment provider. Its subsidiary KuangChi Science listed in Hong Kong in 2014. It has invested in several companies in recent years, including Canadian solar-powered aircraft company Solar Ship and New Zealand jetpack maker Martin Aircraft. “The GCI portfolio companies will share access to Kuang-Chi’s technology, sales and distribution capabilities, and the wide network of partners with whom we work in China and beyond. Our investments come with an opportunity to expand business in the Chinese market and to establish relationships with leaders across multiple industries,” Liu said. The latest fund follows an initial investment of US$50 million this year in five technology companies in Israel, Canada and Norway, in the fields of video intelligence, gesture control, emotion analytics and biometric authentication. “Chinese companies are becoming important investors globally, with market leaders such as Alibaba, Baidu, Kuang-Chi, and Tencent joining Intel, Google, Apple and others as strategic investors and acquirers,” said Dorian Barak, Kuang-Chi’s global investment director. At the same time, more and more start-ups across the world, in countries such as Israel, are focusing on bringing their products and capabilities into the Chinese market, Barak said. China’s outbound technology-related mergers and acquisitions reached an annual high of US$17.6 billion covering 69 transactions in the first four months of this year, topping the US$14.9 billion recorded for the whole of last year, according to research company Dealogic. This year, there have been 110 complete or pending investments by Chinese firms in Europe, “an extremely strong year”, according to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in an annual report released in September.

First, was the graphics card - of course, NVIDIA is a GPU company, guys. They sent us over their older GeForce GTX 760 2GB, while we used our new Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1060 6GB as an upgrade.     But it's the storage upgrade that had me excited, and which shows an incredible value for money upgrade for your gaming needs - so we ran Windows 10 on a mechanical HDD, and then again on an SSD with a bunch of games. The results were interesting, but both upgrades at the same time are also a great thing to do if you want additional performance - but don't have the $1199 for that super-quick Titan X graphics card.       We used older components for the CPU, motherboard, and RAM - with an Intel Core i5 760, GIGABYTE H97M-Gaming 3 motherboard and 8GB of DDR3 RAM from Corsair. Alongside that hardware, I used Corsair's AX860i PSU which ensures more than enough power is going to the system (heck, the system doesn't even go over 300W of power...), so 860W is really overkill for a system like this.   Hardware Used   Intel Core i5-4670K GIGABYTE H97M-Gaming 3 motherboard Corsair 8GB DDR3 RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB Corsair AX860i PSU Windows 10 Home x64     Games Benchmarked   Battlefield 1 Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Grand Theft Auto V Overwatch 3DMark Unigine Heaven   We've tested four games and two benchmarks for now, with more games on the way. Our preliminary testing includes a new game in the form of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, a super-popular new FPS in Overwatch, and then, of course, Grand Theft Auto V. And, of course, we had to include BF1. For the synthetic benchmarks, we've thrown 3DMark and Heaven into the mix, but again - we'll be adding more to the list very soon.

SDN provides control to enterprise business operations through a single logical point, simplifying network design and operation. The Americas accounted for majority of the network function virtualization market shares and will continue to lead the market during the forecast period. The region is witnessing a significant move from proof of concepts to commercial deployment of NFV by the telecom operators, which will drive the network function virtualization market growth. Leading telecom operators such as AT&T, Telefónica, Verizon, and CenturyLink are deploying NFV and SDN technologies in areas that can yield higher ROI. The migration to 5G will drive the requirement of deploying NFV and SDN. The software segment was the major revenue contributing segment in network function virtualization market. The increase in deployment of virtualized software among enterprise data centers such as cloud service providers (CSPs) and internet service providers (ISPs) will result in the growth of the market.

As Apple noted at its recent “Town Hall” event - where it unveiled its new MacBook Pro and basically, well, nothing else – what it DIDN’T talk about was a lot more revealing than what it did. There's little to be excited about if you weren’t already looking for a simple update to your current MBP; most of the improvements are hangovers from other devices (Force Touch, Touch ID) and the Touch Bar is a nice little gimmick to offer those who might be looking at other non-Apple options. But if you were looking for a MacOS device that wasn’t overpowered and overpriced, you would have walked away disappointed. Most of Apple’s PC stock is very dated. It’s desktop units - the Mac Pro, Mac Mini and iMac - are all between one and three years old. The MacBook Air, one of its most popular and critically acclaimed devices, is almost two years old. This is an eternity in the PC world; even if you weren’t looking for the latest and greatest, most of this stock is just not worth the price of admission. There are far too many good looking and better priced Windows machines that offer more features and better performance. Unless you are an app developer, or need a machine to manage iOS devices, there isn’t much of a reason to buy anything older than a year. None of these devices saw any updates this year. Apple also ditched its 11in options on both the MBP and Air while drastically increasing the pricing on its 13in and 15in models; removing an important entry-level option for those who don’t need the insane power of a MBP. So, what about the Macbook you might ask? This unit uses a Core-M processor, rather than the standard processors in the Air – it’s not a fast; thin machine, rather something very basic for those who don’t need much more than a browser and a web processor. Secondly, Sierra was hardly a stellar example of how to bring the desktop into an increasingly cloud friendly world. Much of the links to iCloud were clumsy and proprietary, locking out competitors like Dropbox by natively syncing core user files to Drive and breaking existing links. Siri runs as it does on a phone, rather than sitting in the background collating information or doing anything clever. As such, MacOS exists as it did ten years ago, rebranding basic updates to its native applications as 'innovations'. "Sierra was hardly a stellar example of how to bring the desktop into an increasingly cloud friendly world." If anything, Sierra makes the case for MacOS not existing at all. It ties itself tighter into iOS style features, with notification bars, Siri, links to iPhone/Watch and Music. Its App library is dwindling and expensive. It isn’t customisable nor is it friendly to third party software. Most of its features are increasingly part of the walled garden – iCloud is only accessible via a bodgy software addon or website on Windows, as opposed to Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive, which offer native applications for both systems. MacOS feels weak, dated and abandoned while iOS feels fresh, exciting and innovative. My phone does a better job of handling my various applications, notifications and files than MacOS does. If Apple is all about making PC use as simple and fun as its phones, it’s doing a bad job. If it’s attempting to continue to make its UI cleaner and more accessible for developers and power users, it’s also doing a bad job. This attitude is the reason we didn’t see any wholesale refresh of its PC range this year. Apple just isn't sure about how they want to approach the market – does the company stick to a couple of laptops, or hold strong on its roots with new iMacs and micro desktops? Many rumors were flying that MacOS was basically on the way to becoming an ARM-based OS – removing Intel processors altogether and leveraging its staggering iOS library across into its PCs with the same chips that power iPhones and iPads. Think the iPad Pro with a hardware keyboard. Sure, PCs are boring (let's not go too crazy -Ed). But they are essential devices that we all do our work on, every day. Microsoft has offered an impressive case for Windows 10 – drastically improving its AI, Cloud and Gaming chops while improving performance across the board. OEM PC makers have also heeded the call, with a host of fantastic offerings – from HP’s Slice to Razer’s Stealth. There is still innovation to be found in the segment, because slowing growth aside, we’re still looking at a $13-billion market. Microsoft’s own hardware event this week also showcased some of its own brilliant offerings. Many people love MacOS in opposition to Windows, and they enjoy its tight collaboration with the rest of Apple’s ecosystem. It’s important that Apple decides whether it is still going to hang around in this market, or whether its users should start buying Surface Books and Studios instead.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON (AP) – THE ISSUE: The rich keep getting richer while more Americans are getting left behind financially. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 percent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 percent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 percent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 percent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that it’s thinning out the ranks of the middle class. — WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system “rigged” against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. — WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality “the defining challenge of our time.” And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 percent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for “superstars,” according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren’t working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a “hollowed out” labor market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle. Social factors have amplified the trend as well. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than other families and less likely to ascend the income ladder. Finally, men and women with college degrees and high pay are more likely to marry each other and amplify income gaps. — This story is part of AP’s “Why It Matters” series, examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) Print Email Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive By Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 30, 2016 at 5:55 AM, updated October 30, 2016 at 5:56 AM comments Oregonians buying health care in the individual marketplace face double-digit rate increases in the coming year. And more than a quarter of them — 58,000 people — have lost or will be losing coverage as insurers go out of business or abandon specific markets, particularly in rural areas of the state. It's a painful spike, and one that will make federal subsidies a critical piece of the health care equation for many consumers. In a conference call preview of the open enrollment period that begins Nov. 1, state officials, including the governor, gushed last week about high enrollment levels last year and the now single-digit percentage of Oregonians who remain uninsured. They maintain that 62 percent of Oregonians can find a plan that costs $100 or less in monthly premiums, and that there are 26,000 Oregonians who are eligible for federal tax credits who aren't taking them. But the fact remains, for many consumers, that the Affordable Care Act is hardly that. One 59-year-old rancher in eastern Oregon who asked that his name not be used told The Oregonian/OregonLive last week that his new plan will cost $828 a month, or nearly $10,000 a year. That's a bronze level plan, with a $6,000 deductible and a $6,000 maximum co-pay. Indeed, the individual health care market is costly, chaotic and confusing. Availability of plans and prices vary widely by age and geography. The penalties are rising again for those who go without insurance, as are federal subsidies for those who qualify. So it's worth shopping around, versus automatically re-enrolling in your existing plan. And with open enrollment approaching, it's a good idea to get some help. "All of the plans are changing," said Lisa Morawski, a spokeswoman for Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services. "They change every year, so it's good to sit down with someone to help you make that choice." It doesn't cost extra to buy a specific insurance plan through a broker than on your own. You can find an agent in your area by going to OregonHealthcare.gov or calling the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace at 1-855-268-3767. The average monthly premium for a benchmark plan in Oregon is set to go up by 27 percent in 2017. For a 27-year-old, for example, the premium would increase from $225 to $287, according to federal government data released earlier this month. That's slightly higher than the national average, which is poised to jump 25 percent in states that use HealthCare.gov. Coverage is far more spendy as you get older. And the cost varies widely based on where you live. A 40-year-old in Portland, for example, can expect to spend $324 a month next year for Health Net Health Plan's silver level plan. In Hermiston, that same person could expect to spend $476, or 47 percent more, for the same coverage, according to the Department of Consumer and Business Services. Tax credits Federal tax credits are the primary means of making the Affordable Care Act affordable. What you qualify for depends on your modified adjusted gross income, and a set of IRS guidelines that detail the percentage of tax filers' earnings they are expected to contribute toward health insurance. Again, it's a complicated equation. But bottom line, subsidies are available to anyone making less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That ends up being a fairly high number. Next year, it's anything less than $47,520 for a single household and $97,200 for a family of four. Consumers who are eligible for the tax credit also may be eligible for lower co-pays and deductibles when they see a doctor. Those cost-sharing reduction subsidies are available to consumers who make from 100 to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2016, nearly three-quarters of the 135,965 individuals who bought insurance through Oregon's exchange qualified for a subsidy, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. On average, the tax credits reduced monthly premiums by 64 percent. For the Spears family in Banks, the tax credit was even more generous. James Spears took early retirement from Intel last year. As part of the deal, the tech company covered his family's insurance premiums for 18 months. But that coverage expired in August, pushing them into the individual marketplace. They went to a broker, who took their data and returned with three plans from which to choose. They ultimately selected Providence. It wasn't the cheapest; it will leave them paying for chiropractic and physical therapy visits out of pocket, for instance, but it gave them the best mix of affordability and coverage. They also got a major subsidy. With their income down this year, their youngest child qualified for coverage under the Oregon Health Plan. The cost of their individual plan for two adults and their son is about $1,000 a month. The federal subsidy covers almost 80 percent, said Patricia Spears. "It was a nice relief, even if adjustments come up later on," she said. "Because of the threshold being where it's at, you can get to the point where you can actually afford to live and have health insurance." But she also reiterated the need to use an agent. "I wouldn't even try to do any of it myself," she said. The subsidies aren't tied to individual plans. They're based on the benchmark plan in the area — the second-lowest cost silver plan. It's also important to estimate your income as accurately as possible when applying, said Gladys Boutwell, the agent who worked with the Spears family. The tax credits reduce your monthly premium right away, but the IRS ultimately squares up with taxpayers at the end of the year. "If they underestimate their incomes, they may have to pay part or all of it back," Boutwell said. Individual mandate The Obamacare penalty for not having insurance — also called the individual mandate — is also increasing. In 2014, it was 1 percent of modified adjusted gross income, or $95, whichever was higher. It jumped to the greater of 2 percent of MAGI, or $395 for 2015. This year it's 2.5 percent of MAGI, or $695. In 2017 and subsequent years, the penalty will continue going up by the rate of U.S. inflation, That's likely to be a modest increase, given that inflation is so low. But it compounds each year. And don't forget, you're paying for each adult household member and child who is uninsured. The penalty for being uninsured this year is $695 per adult and $347.50 for each child younger than 18, with a maximum of $2,085. About 93 percent of Oregonians had health insurance in 2015, up from 90.3 percent the previous year, according to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. Young adults, those 19 to 34, still had the lowest coverage rates, according to the Oregon Health Insurance Survey. The report found several contributing factors, including the fact that young adults lose coverage under their parents' plans at age 26; they're less likely to have health insurance through work; and they may think they don't need it. But the cost of insurance is getting prohibitive for many age groups. Boutwell says she hears tales from clients each year. They don't want the government to tell them what to do, they don't think they need it, or feel like they're wasting money. She usually shares her own experience on that front. Three years ago, her husband got laid off from his job, and put off buying insurance for a few months. He ended up having to get his appendix removed because of severe appendicitis. "A month later, we got a bill for $20,000," she said. "It's worth paying the premium." --Ted Sickinger tsickinger@oregonian.com @tedsickinger Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

Baca / Journal Staff Writer Monday, October 31st, 2016 at 3:10pm The PNM Building is located at 414 Silver Avenue SW in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico on Monday, March 7, 2016. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state’s largest electric utility, has withdrawn from regulatory consideration a plan to build a $100 million natural gas plant and pipeline in San Juan County. In a conference call with investors last week, PNM said it was abandoning the proposal due to lower-than-expected energy demand projections. “We’re finding the highest points are not as high as we had previously forecasted,” CEO and President Pat Vincent-Collawn said during the call. “As a result of this, we have decided to file a motion to withdraw the application.” The company filed the motion with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission on Friday. Advertisement Continue reading The 80-megawatt plant was part of PNM’s plan to replace energy lost from the closure of half of the coal-powered San Juan Generating Station. PNM agreed to the closure as part of a 2015 settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at reducing air pollution in the Four Corners area. In a statement, PNM spokesman Pahl Shipley said it is possible the company will revive the proposal in the future. PNM is currently evaluating its energy portfolio for the next two decades. “The current forecast indicates PNM will need additional resources by 2020,” said Shipley. “We will continue to evaluate resource needs going forward and will file a new application with the commission if a new plant or other resources are required to serve PNM customers.” In its motion to withdraw the plan, the utility said it would use market purchases to meet any energy needs in 2018 and 2019 that go beyond its current resources. The motion was unopposed by any of the intervening parties in the case. PNM’s gas plan met the fiercest resistance from the advocacy organization New Energy Economy, which accused the utility of proposing an unnecessary project to justify increasing customer rates and the company’s profits. “We are thrilled that PNM is dismissing their gas plant and gas pipeline case,” said Mariel Nanasi, New Energy Economy’s executive director, in a statement. “Consumer demand is actually going down, but despite this, PNM thought they could get away with even more bloat: $100 million for a superfluous gas plant and gas pipeline just to line the pockets of PNM’s senior management off the misery of the poor.” Shipley declined to comment on Nanasi’s comments. Though none of the intervening parties opposed PNM’s motion to withdraw the application, New Energy Economy opposed the utility’s request to halt the collection of additional documents and information from PNM as part of the legal process known as discovery. PNM has reported a 16 percent net earnings drop to $40.9 million in the third quarter compared to the same time a year ago. The drop was due in part to decreased electric demand at Intel’s Rio Rancho plant, as well as a recent rate case decision that approved a customer rate hike far smaller than the one PNM had requested. The company’s third quarter earnings reflected $11.3 million in pre-tax regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs as a result of that decision. PNM has said it will file a new rate case in December. Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Energy Most Recent Biz News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Dr Michael Naylor, a senior lecturer in insurance at the Massey Business School, has undertaken a meta-analysis of how a range of technologies will change the industry in the coming decade. His report, ‘A Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technology’ aims to help insurers prepare for a very different future. “Insurers need to change their view of their business as a provider of insurance products to being a data company with real-time links to customers, specialising in personal services,” Dr Naylor says. “Any organisation that is not a big data house now, or is unable to become one soon, is already a legacy company.” Dr Naylor’s vision of the future also has many implications for consumers. “In the future, all insured objects will give constant, real-time feedback to the insurer’s data centre – and that includes people. Wearable technology can provide minute-by-minute blood pressure readings and tell if your blood chemistry indicates an illness,” he says. “Through the connection of objects to the internet it will be possibe for insurers to know how healthy the food in your fridge is or how often you exercise. Imagine how accurately they can then predict your health risk for insurance purposes. “You have to agree to share this information, of course, but if you do and you are healthy, you should see your insurance premiums plummet. But if you don’t agree to it, you’ll be classed as high-risk and your premiums will be very expensive.” Dr Naylor says the car insurance industry will probably be the first to sector to face major disruption. “Once networked, autonomous cars are widely available, it’s been predicted that car crashes will reduce by 80 to 90 per cent. This development is not as far away as you might think – Volvo, for example has an aim of eliminating car crashes by 2020.” Dr Naylor believes car theft will largely become a thing of the past as voice and face recognition technology makes them nearly impossible to steal, leaving insurance only for damage caused by things bumping into the car or extreme weather events. “The result is car insurance premiums will fall drastically, probably by as much as 90 per cent by 2030.” He says that while many might view his report as speculation, there are plenty of examples of innovative insurers overseas who are using technology to change their business models. British insurer Drive Like A Girl monitors the drivers it insures via a telemetric device that sends real-time reports, including alerts of any crashes. The company is popular with young drivers who can prove they shouldn’t have to pay the high rates generally imposed on them, Dr Naylor says. “Then there’s American firm Social Intel, which provides data to underwriters by using software to analyse people’s social media posts, rather than more traditional metrics. “New Zealand insurers are probably a few years behind those in the United States and Europe, but they need to start grappling with these changes now. If they don’t, new disruptors will emerge to take their business from them.” ‘A Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technology’ can be purchased as a paperback or downloadable PDF from: https://sway.com/tOcPLREeEb0fFaQe The full report covers: · Key disruptors · Telemetrics · Big data · Social media · Automated underwriting · Automated claims · Robo advice · Motor insurance · Health and life insurance · Suggestions for how insurers can restructure their business to survive Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news Queensgate Shopping Centre – Situation Update November 14 earthquake upgraded to M7.8 Wellington state highways recovering but plan for travel The effects of the quakes on your staff Marine uplift from Kaikoura earthquake (updated) Slip between Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers cleared Judgment: Fonterra v McIntyre and Williamson UPDATE @ 4:15 pm Wednesday 16 November $25,000 Raised for Breast Cancer Research Survey shows businesses spending less time on tax ‘Nil-all draw’ in NZX vs Ralec verdict Minister thanks retiring EECA chief executive EQC defends Christchurch repairs Historic double win at National Competition Availability of new insurance for post quake house purchases Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

Dr Michael Naylor, a senior lecturer in insurance at the Massey Business School, has undertaken a meta-analysis of how a range of technologies will change the industry in the coming decade. His report, ‘A Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technology’ aims to help insurers prepare for a very different future. "Insurers need to change their view of their business as a provider of insurance products to being a data company with real-time links to customers, specialising in personal services," Dr Naylor says. "Any organisation that is not a big data house now, or is unable to become one soon, is already a legacy company." Dr Naylor’s vision of the future also has many implications for consumers. "In the future, all insured objects will give constant, real-time feedback to the insurer’s data centre - and that includes people. Wearable technology can provide minute-by-minute blood pressure readings and tell if your blood chemistry indicates an illness," he says. "Through the connection of objects to the internet it will be possibe for insurers to know how healthy the food in your fridge is or how often you exercise. Imagine how accurately they can then predict your health risk for insurance purposes. "You have to agree to share this information, of course, but if you do and you are healthy, you should see your insurance premiums plummet. But if you don’t agree to it, you’ll be classed as high-risk and your premiums will be very expensive." Car insurance industry - gone by 2030 Dr Naylor says the car insurance industry will probably be the first to sector to face major disruption. "Once networked, autonomous cars are widely available, it’s been predicted that car crashes will reduce by 80 to 90 per cent. This development is not as far away as you might think - Volvo, for example has an aim of eliminating car crashes by 2020." Dr Naylor believes car theft will largely become a thing of the past as voice and face recognition technology makes them nearly impossible to steal, leaving insurance only for damage caused by things bumping into the car or extreme weather events. "The result is car insurance premiums will fall drastically, probably by as much as 90 per cent by 2030." He says that while many might view his report as speculation, there are plenty of examples of innovative insurers overseas who are using technology to change their business models. British insurer Drive Like A Girl monitors the drivers it insures via a telemetric device that sends real-time reports, including alerts of any crashes. The company is popular with young drivers who can prove they shouldn’t have to pay the high rates generally imposed on them, Dr Naylor says. "Then there’s American firm Social Intel, which provides data to underwriters by using software to analyse people’s social media posts, rather than more traditional metrics. "New Zealand insurers are probably a few years behind those in the United States and Europe, but they need to start grappling with these changes now. If they don’t, new disruptors will emerge to take their business from them." ‘A Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technology’ can be purchased as a paperback or downloadable PDF from: https://sway.com/tOcPLREeEb0fFaQe The full report covers: Key disruptors Telemetrics Big data Social media Automated underwriting Automated claims Robo advice Motor insurance Health and life insurance Suggestions for how insurers can restructure their business to survive Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

News Home > Metro > SMEBiz > News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 31 October 2016 R&D shifting to software 123rf.com Companies that allocate more of their research-and-development budgets to software and service rather than physical products are reporting significantly higher revenue growth than others, says PwC’s Strategy&. BY 2020, companies will have shifted the majority of their research-and-development spending away from product-based offerings to software and service offerings, according to the 2016 Global Innovation 1000 Study from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business. The need to stay competitive is the top reason why companies cited a shift in their R&D budgets towards software and services, and for good reason, according to the study. It said companies that reported faster revenue growth relative to key competitors allocated 25% more of their R&D budgets to software offerings than companies that reported slower revenue growth. Between 2010 and 2015, the average allocation of R&D spending for software and services increased from 54% to 59%, and is expected to grow to 63% by 2020. Meanwhile, the average allocation of R&D spending dedicated to product-based offerings fell to 41% (from 46% in 2010), and is expected to fall to 37% by 2020 — an overall decrease of 19% this decade. Average allocation of R&D spending on software offerings alone will increase by 43% by the end of this decade, and R&D spending on services will gradually overtake investment in product-based innovation (39% vs 37% by 2020). Global R&D spending on software offerings has increased by 65% between 2010-2015, from US$86bil to US$142bil. Many of the world’s major innovators are in the midst of a transformational journey mostly driven by changing and rising customer expectations, says Barry Jaruzelski, innovation and R&D expert for Strategy& and principal with PwC US. The shift is also being driven by the supercharged pace of improvement in what software can do, including the increasing use of embedded software and sensors in products, the ability to reliably and inexpensively connect products, customers and manufacturers via the Internet of Things (IoT), and the availability of cloud-based data storage. Companies will recruit fewer mechanical engineers and more data and software engineers to build their capabilities, the study predicts. To support the development of software and services offerings, fewer companies will focus their R&D spending on the electrical and mechanical field. By 2020, the number of companies reporting electrical engineers as their top employed engineering specialty will fall by 35% and the proportion of companies who expect that data engineers will represent their largest group of employed engineers will double from 8% to 16%. Jaruzelski says an increase in software and services, even in more traditional industries has created a shift towards hiring talent that can develop software and provide platforms to collect and analyse product-related data. The shift is already changing the way business schools think about their course offerings, and will have profound effects both on education and, more generally, on the future of employment. Regionally, companies in North America are making the strongest shift to software offerings from 15% of total R&D spending in 2010 to 24% in 2020. Asia remains the most product-centric region, with 44% of R&D allocated to product offerings in 2010, only falling to 40% in 2020. The automotive and industrial sectors are making the most aggressive push towards developing new software offerings. Among companies that made an acquisition during the past five years, the vast majority (71%) were made to enhance capabilities in software (33%) or services (38%). Strategy&’s annual analysis of the world’s 1000 largest R&D spenders also found the following: By 2018, the healthcare sector will surpass computing and electronics to become the largest R&D spending industry globally (US$165bil vs US$159bil), and the software and Internet industry will leap ahead of the automotive sector (US$129bil vs US$105bil). Industrials rounds out the Top 5 R&D industries by spend. For the first time in the study’s history, the number of Global Innovation 1000 companies headquartered in the US grew, up 9.5% year over year. Volkswagen, Samsung, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Intel round out the Top 5 R&D Spenders, with Amazon and Google making bold moves up the list (+4 and +2 positions, respectively). Global innovation professionals responding to a 2016 survey have ranked Apple, Alphabet (Google), and 3M as the three Most Innovative Companies in the world. The 10 Most Innovative Companies continue to outperform the Top 10 R&D spenders on key performance metrics, as has been the case for each of the past seven years. – Bernama Tags / Keywords: Central Region , PwC , Strategy , R D spending Related Stories Luxury sky homes all set for take-off Tweets reveal our health?

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD's next-gen APU has Zen CPU cores, Vega GPU, and HBM2 AMD's upcoming 'Raven Ridge' APU will have PS4-class graphics, with Vega GPU and HBM2 By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Oct 30, 2016 12:51 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA AMD has an exciting year ahead of itself in both the CPU and GPU divisions, with their next-gen Vega GPU architecture set to be unveiled soon, and their upcoming Raven Ridge APU that has some surprising tech inside of it.     According to the latest report from Bitsandchips.it, AMD is working on a few Raven Ridge APUs - with the higher-end model featuring a 1024-core Vega GPU with HBM2, 16 CUs, DDR4 support, with Zen CPU cores (4 x CPU cores, 4 x - and it all arrives in TDPs of between 35-95W.   The lower-end version loses the HBM2 technology and kicks the Vega GPU from 16CUs on the high-end model, to 12 CUs on the lower-end model. The 170mm² part will have a TDP of 4-35W, with both versions of the Raven Ridge APUs being made on the 14nm FinFET process.     Surpassing Xbox One/PS4 Level Graphics/Performance   Let's face it, the rendering power of the PS4 isn't that great - but for mainstream gamers, it's enough. What is enough, though? 1080p 30FPS is about the norm with consoles these days, at around Medium preset graphics. The new HBM2 tech inside of the Raven Ridge APUs will be interesting, as I'm sure AMD will show game developers how to better utilize the much-faster memory technology for added performance inside of the lower APU power envelope.   AMD recently made it into Apple's latest MacBook Pro with its Radeon Pro 400 series graphics, which hits 35W and is based on the Polaris 11 GPU with 1024 stream processors and 2 TFLOPs of performance.   AMD's next-gen APU is a CPU/GPU in one, versus the Polaris-based Radeon Pro 400 series GPU inside of the new MacBook Pro. The new APU from AMD mixes the upcoming next-gen Zen CPU architecture with Radeon Technologies Groups' next-gen Vega GPU architecture into a single, low-powered, monster APU.   This means we can expect much better performance from the Zen and Vega-powered Raven Ridge APU, as the respective CPU and GPU architectures are expected to be much better than what's available right now.   Prepare to be excited: AMD is definitely in a position of power going into 2017, as it has forged the end of 2016 well with a successful launch of their Polaris-based Radeon RX 400 series graphics cards. But 2017 is looking even better with their next-gen Zen and Vega architectures, and the thought of AMD once again being in a position of having both a great CPU and GPU is really quite exciting.   Intel can't quite get a grip on the GPU side of things, and NVIDIA isn't on the PC side of CPU dominance (while it has CPU cores inside of its Tegra SoCs, they're mostly found in tablets - but NVIDIA has just hit the Nintendo Switch console). This gives AMD a big chance to nail 2017 to the wall with CPU, APU, and GPU launches. NEWS SOURCES:Bitsandchips.it Recommended for You Intel's new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K will cost...

Oct 30th 2016, 9:30 AM 15,545 Views 4 Comments Share6 Tweet Email1 Image: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd AN IRISH HEALTHCARE startup bankrolled by a venture capital firm set up by the head of Starbucks has just raised a fresh $40 million (€36 million) in funding. Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI), which was founded last year, is an early stage life-sciences company researching the genetic causes of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis. Speaking about the funding announcement, GMI chief executive Daniel Crowley said the series A investment would be put towards the creation of a genomic research and development centre and hiring 150 new staff over the next three years. He added that the company, which is based at Dublin’s NovaUCD, will soon announce its first collaboration with an Irish hospital. “We look forward to working closely with the Irish healthcare system to develop better diagnostics and new means to optimise health and patient outcomes,” he said. “The size and characteristics of the Irish population can powerfully advance scientific discovery as researchers are able to pinpoint variations in DNA relevant to disease and useful for improving medicine.” The latest round of funding was provided by Arch Venture Partners, Polaris Partners and the VC firm formerly known as Google Ventures. Maveron, a venture capital firm established by Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, was a previous seed investor in the company but was not part of this series A investment. Ireland’s sovereign wealth fund, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is also involved in the funding round. Earlier this year, ISIF director Eugene O’Callaghan said it planned to commit over €750 million to Irish companies and funds during 2016. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Source: AP Photo/Ted S. Warren Beginnings GMI was set up by a group of entrepreneurs, investors and researchers from the health-tech space in 2015 and is run by Crowley, with the former head of the drug company HiberGen and researcher at Pfizer Maurice Treacy also on board as a director. Crowley and Treacy are both venture partners at Arch Venture Partners, one of the main investors behind GMI, that has over $2.5 billion committed in funding to different startups worldwide. Arch has funded over 200 companies since it was created 30 years ago, including Irish chip manufacturer Movidius that is in the process of being bought by Intel. It also backed genetic research company Illumina and biopharmaceutical company Receptos, which was bought for $7.2 billion last year.
