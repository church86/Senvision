By Tas Bindi for Null Pointer | May 29, 2017 -- 05:12 GMT (22:12 PDT) | Topic: CXO Kate Burleigh resigns from Intel Image: Supplied Kate Burleigh, managing director at Intel Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), has announced that she is leaving the chip giant after a 20-year stint on June 30, 2017. Burleigh said the "time seems right" to pursue opportunities outside of Intel. Burleigh served as the ANZ managing director since 2012 during which she oversaw Intel's transformation from a PC-focused company to one that seeks to power connected computing devices. In addition to growing the local Intel business, Burleigh is credited for advocating for STEM education in schools and smart government policy on technology during her 20-year tenure. "Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the Managing Director role in Australia and New Zealand. Under her leadership, Intel's impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels," said Jerry Tsao, VP of Intel's Sales & Marketing Group and GM of Regional Sales for the Asia Pacific and Japan region. Prior to becoming the ANZ chief, Burleigh spent six years as Intel's marketing and retail sales director, working across the organisation as a PR manager, online marketing manager, and enterprise marketing manager among others. Given the nature of the sales and marketing industry, where there are typically more females, Burleigh told TechRepublic last year that she never noticed the gender imbalance. It was only when she started putting her hand up for enterprise sales roles that she felt she had to justify her job a little more. "It wasn't that it was harder, but I had to have that second or third conversation that I really was serious and I seriously wanted it, because were a few question marks over could you really do it, and I could never say it was because I was female, or was it because my skills were [such that] I was identified more strongly as a consumer marketer," she said previously. Burleigh is also among a number of high-ranking female executives to leave the company in the last couple of years. Intel's executive ranks have been in a state of flux since mid-2015, when Intel president Renee James exited the company. The chip giant has since replaced many of its top female managers including former CFO Stacy Smith and CIO Kim Stevenson, though Smith remains at the company in a different role. Earlier this month, Intel announced that long-time executive Diane Bryant was stepping down from her role as GM of the Data Center Group to tend to a personal family matter. Intel said she would return to the company in a new role. Intel's 2016 diversity report showed that the chip giant had 26,159 female employees as of December 2016, accounting for 25.8 percent of the company's 86,071 employee population. 18,524 of these women, or 21.5 percent, held technical roles, while 73 or 18.4 percent of women held leadership roles, according to statistics released in December. Men, in comparison, represented 78.4 percent of technical roles and 81.3 percent of leadership roles. Intel appears to be aware of the gender disparity in its workforce. It was one of the first companies to make its diversity stats publicly available through its EEO-1 reports filed with the US government. At the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show, CEO Brian Krzanich boldly proclaimed on stage that the company would achieve full representation by 2020. To further demonstrate its commitment to the cause, Intel has also pledged $300 million on initiatives to increase diversity. The company will, however, need to drastically increase its rate of progression to make full representation a reality in three years.

Burleigh: 20 years leading Intel Burleigh handled a range of different jobs during her time with Intel, becoming marketing manager in 2005 before she was handed the Australia and New Zealand MD role in 2005. Intel is the world’s biggest computer chip manufacturer. Jerry Tsao, Intel’s vice president sales and marketing group and general manager regional sales group for Asia Pacific and Japan, said that during her time at the company Burleigh had extended its influence to new areas. “Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the managing director role in Australia and New Zealand,” Tsao said in a statement. “Under her leadership, Intel’s impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels. We thank Kate for the passion and dedication she showed Intel and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavours.” Burleigh said it was the right time to make the move after a long career in a sector renowned for high executive turnover. “I’m proud to say that I joined Intel when Andy Grove was still CEO and I’m as excited today as I was all those years ago about the transformative innovation that Intel is driving,” Burleigh said. “Although it is incredibly hard to leave such a fantastic company and so many great people, the time seems right for me to make a career change and pursue opportunities outside of Intel. I have been privileged to be at the centre of technology transformation thanks to Intel and trust I will have the chance to apply my passion for innovation in my future career.“ Along with growing and maintaining the prominence of a brand which largely lies hidden inside computers and laptops, Burleigh was also an advocate for science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and pushed for smarter government policy on technology. She leaves the role at the end of June with Intel saying it will announce her successor “in due course”. Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Best Dividend Stocks in Virtual Reality Microsoft, Intel, IBM, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are all putting serious resources into capturing a share of the burgeoning VR market -- and paying their investors while they do so. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 28, 2017 at 4:46PM The virtual reality (VR) market is expected to be worth about $34 billion annually by 2022. Tech investors are understandably excited about this expanding opportunity, particularly as giants like Facebook and Alphabet make huge plays in the space. Those looking to benefit from this fast-growing market -- and receive a dividend at the same time -- should consider what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) are doing in virtual reality.  Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft Microsoft folds its augmented reality and virtual reality pursuits into one category that it calls "mixed reality." That can be a bit confusing when it comes to parsing the success of the separate formats, but just know that Microsoft is making very early moves into what could become a transformative play in the virtual space.  The company's HoloLens headset is its most outward-facing mixed reality play right now. The device allows its users to see holographic images overlaid into the real world, and developers are exploring a wide array of possibilities for the tech. It can give people new ways to view industrial equipment, could be used in the training of surgeons by overlaying real-world images with digital information, and may transform how we communicate with others through telepresence.  But one of the most important aspects of mixed reality that Microsoft investors should focus on are its efforts to use it as the foundation of a new computing platform. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has suggested that virtual reality might be the next major tech platform, and the Windows-maker is treating it that way. As PC Magazine wrote back in April, "Microsoft is building a software and device ecosystem around the Windows Mixed Reality platform, formerly known as Windows Holographic." Microsoft is already partnering with device makers to launch a version of its mixed reality software, which runs a version of Windows 10, this year. On top of its aggressive mixed reality pursuit, Microsoft is also a solid dividend play for income investors. It is currently yielding 2.3%, with a 66% payout ratio, and a 13-year streak of dividend hikes behind it. NVIDIA Don't worry if you've overlooked NVIDIA as a dividend player in the past. The company only started paying one out back in 2012, and it's admittedly yielding far less than other companies in VR space; its current trailing 12-month yield is just 0.37%, with a payout ratio of 18.9%. Despite it not being the most lucrative dividend stock, investors should keep two things in mind about this company: First, it has massive potential in VR; and second, the stock appears to have a lot of room to grow. Gaming is one of the most important segments of VR, and NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) already dominate the discrete desktop GPU space -- which is key to gaming -- with a 70.5% market share. That means that when PC manufacturers are in need of high-end graphics processing power (which VR eats up by the bowl-full), they most often look to NVIDIA.  NVIDIA has been doing its own part to help the VR market expand by releasing a suite of APIs to assist developers in creating VR games and apps, and has even released its own VR game to show off the capabilities of its products. Additionally, NVIDIA is helping the PC market adapt by launching VR-ready graphics cards for notebooks, which helps expand the computing platforms that can fully handle VR beyond the realm of high-powered PCs.  Intel  Intel's bet on VR may be more muted than other tech players, but it isn't all that different than NVIDIA's in some regards. The chipmaker expects that more powerful (and expensive) processors will be needed to power PCs and VR headsets as this market expands, which it hopes will result in it selling more chips.  Intel is already marketing some of its chips for the VR market; for example, on its website, it says that its iCore 7 processor helps create "a great VR experience." To help show off its processors' capabilities, Intel is working its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, which has an Intel chip embedded in the device itself, allowing it to operate untethered from a computer. It's worth noting here that Alloy is expected to run a version of Microsoft's mixed reality software when it launches at the end of this year.  Intel is solid bet for both VR and income investors. Its shares currently yield 2.9%, and the company sports a payout ratio of about 45%. Qualcomm Like Intel, Qualcomm is jumping into the VR fray through its processors and a headset developer kit. The company is putting its Snapdragon 835 processor into the standalone headset, along with other chips for wireless connectivity and memory.  The device will ship by the second half of this year and can be used without having to be tethered to a computer. In fact, at Google's I/O conference earlier this month Qualcomm and Google announced that the chipmaker is working with Google to bring untethered Daydream VR headsets to market later this year, which will also be powered by the Snapdragon 835 processor. Aside from its growing VR opportunities, Qualcomm has an impressive dividend yield of 3.6%, and 14 consecutive years of dividend growth. IBM I know, I know -- IBM seemed like an unlikely VR play to me too -- at first. But it turns out that the company's Watson artificial intelligence platform has virtual reality applications as well. IBM recently partnered with game maker Ubisoft to incorporate speech recognition and cognitive capabilities from its Watson into the latest Star Trek virtual reality game. According to IBM, gamers will be able to speak commands in the game, and Watson will help the system parse what they're saying and respond appropriately in a way that games have never been able to do before. The company also recently launched a developer kit specifically designed to help content creators incorporate natural language processing into VR software. As IBM noted in a recent press release, "We are only just seeing the impact of virtual and augmented reality and IBM is committed to providing developers with the tools they need to innovate and be competitive in this AI and Cognitive era." IBM is just shy of Dividend Aristocrat status, having raised its payout every year for the past 22 years. Its current yield is a solid 3.7%, with a 46% payout ratio, which gives investors looking to profit from VR (and AI) a nice incentive to bet on IBM's prospects.

The competition is open to 4th, 5th and 6th class pupils from across Ireland. Taking part in the Intel Mini Scientist involves creating a science and technology project which can be based on the Primary Science Curriculum or any area, which is of interest to the participating pupils. Once the projects have been developed, schools host an exhibition where all of the projects can be showcased and for which Intel will provide judges and prizes for everyone taking part. A winning project from every school taking part then progresses to a regional final where pupils will have the chance to compete for a place at the National Grand Final. In 2016, almost 6,500 pupils from 15 different counties took part in Mini Scientist with 105 different schools involved.

Live Watch Top Democrat on House Intel Committee calls for review of Kushner's security clearance By Nicki Rossoll Close Follow on Twitter More from Nicki May 28, 2017, 10:14 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJ. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo WATCH Rep. Adam Schiff says 'there ought to be a review' of Kushner's security clearance 0 Shares Email The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat called for a review of Jared Kushner's security clearance over questions of whether he was truthful about his contacts with Russia. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, spoke to ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an exclusive interview on "This Week" Sunday in the wake of revelations that Kushner, the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, talked to the Russian ambassador about establishing a back channel for communications in December, before Trump took office. “If these allegations are true and he had discussions with the Russians about establishing a backchannel and didn't reveal that, that's a real problem in terms of whether he should maintain that kind of a security clearance,” Schiff said. "There ought to be a review of his security clearance to find out whether he was truthful, whether he was candid" about his Russia contacts, Schiff added in an apparent reference to what Kushner may have submitted in the security clearance application process. "If not, than there's no way he can maintain that kind of a clearance." Kushner, who met with the Russian ambassador in December along with Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, asked for back-channel communications to discuss Syria and other policy matters, sources told ABC News. The Democratic National Committee is calling for Kushner's security clearance to be suspended until the federal investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates is completed. "The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house," the DNC deputy communications director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. "Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete." U.S. intelligence operatives reportedly learned about Kushner's interest in back-channel talks through communications that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had with Moscow. Raddatz said Kislyak must know "he’s being monitored all the time" and asked Schiff if it was possible the Russians wanted U.S. intelligence to hear what the Russian ambassador said about Kushner. "Could it be a ruse" by Russia to get Americans to suspect Kushner? Raddatz asked. Schiff responded, "Certainly in dealings with the Russians, they're very sophisticated, you always have to take into consideration that the Russians may be doing things that are designed to throw you off the track or provoke discord." He added, though, that "it's hard to understand ... why this would be some kind of a Russian ruse. Why would they want to undermine the very government that they hope to have a good relationship with?" Schiff said that he expects Kushner to be asked to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat called for a review of Jared Kushner's security clearance over questions of whether he was truthful in his application about his contacts with Russia.

The update not only improves the device’s stability and touch functionality, but also enhances the Surface Pro 4’s battery life when it is in Sleep Mode.  ( Microsoft ) Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 is set to get a massive maintenance update. The company tweaked the sleep and hibernation modes to improve the device's battery life, as well as enhance the system's stability. The Surface Pro 4's firmware update also improves the device's brightness control and system functionality. During the Windows 10 OS' unveiling, Microsoft promised that it would roll out regular firmware updates for its software and hardware platforms. The arrival of the Surface Pro 4's update evidences that the Redmond-based has stayed true to its word. Surface Pro 4 Update Improves Battery Life On Thursday, May 25, Microsoft rolled out the firmware update for its Surface Pro 4 2-in-1 device. The Surface Pro 4 firmware update comes inclusive of features such as Intel Precise Touch Device, Surface System Aggregator Firmware, and Surface Integration drivers. These features were introduced and released in April this year for all Microsoft devices running on Windows 10 version 1703 (Creators Update).The features are currently available for Windows 10 Version 1511 (November Update) and also Windows 10 Version 1607 (Anniversary Update). Apart from these inclusions, Microsoft's Surface team also upgraded the drivers for the Surface Touch Servicing ML, Surface Embedded Controller Firmware, Surface UEFI, and Surface Touch. These drivers were updated to fix screen brightness problems when the device wakes up from the Sleep Mode. Apart from the enhancement in the touch functionality, the Surface Pro 4 firmware update will also improve the brightness settings, adjust the hibernation defaults, make the device more stable to extend battery life during sleep, and disable the touch functionality when the laptop's cover is closed. Surface Pro 4 Firmware Update: What Does It Bring? The new Surface Pro 4 update brings a Microsoft driver upgrade for Surface Embedded Controller Firmware (103.1684.256.0), which will enhance the battery capacity of the device while the Surface Pro 4 is on Sleep Mode. The Intel Corporation driver update for Intel (R) Precise Touch Device with build number 1.2.0.83 is also available for the Surface Pro 4. This update not only enhances the device stability, but also disables the touch functionality when the cover is closed. The Surface driver update with firmware version 1.0.121.0 for Surface Integration fine-tunes the system's Hibernation defaults. The Microsoft driver update for Surface Touch Servicing ML updates the touch functionality. This system upgrade comes with the version number 1.0.724.0. The Surface System Aggregator update resolves screen brightness problems when device wakes up from the Sleep Mode. The Surface UEFI driver update with firmware version 106.1624.768.0 and Surface Touch Microsoft Driver update (57.1.1.1 ) aim to optimize touch functionality. "When Surface updates are provided via the Windows Update service, they are delivered in stages to Surface customers. As a result, not every Surface will receive the update at the same time, but the update will be delivered to all devices," Microsoft notes. A Surface Pro 4 user can download the firmware update from the Microsoft Windows Update page. However, one must ensure that the Surface Pro 4 is running on Windows 10 OS as these drivers and firmware are only compatible with the Windows 10 platform.

Reuters More On: israel Palestinian prisoners end 40-day hunger strike The Six-Day War at 50: Jerusalem then and now Trump draws ire for message at Holocaust museum Trump says peace between Israelis and Palestinians is key to ending Middle East conflict Wondering where to find the next tech startup propelling humanity to the next best thing? Israel’s answer to Silicon Valley is Silicon Wadi, an area around Tel Aviv on the country’s coastal plain with a heavy concentration of high-tech industries that rivals the San Francisco Bay-area’s cluster of innovative firms. There are about 4,300 startups operating in Israel, with about 2,900 of these located within a 10-mile radius, a rate of development second in intensity to only Silicon Valley itself. Even as President Trump was meeting with the Israeli political elite on the Jerusalem leg of his first foreign trip, a huge slice of that country’s brain trust was gathered in Midtown Manhattan to explore the reasons behind this tech wave and showcase some of the developments that have enabled this small country to punch above its weight. Or maybe jumping would be a more apt metaphor. “The cat flea has the ability to jump almost 200 times its height,” Oded Shoseyov, a professor of protein engineering and nano biotechnology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the crowd at Nexus: Israel, a gathering sponsored by the American Friends of Hebrew University. Shoseyov, who has his name on more than 50 patents and has served as the scientific founder of 10 companies specializing in everything from nanotechnology to production of medical cannabis, says that one of the most exciting scientific quests is understanding the jumping power of the flea. That and other marvels of nature are helping spark solutions to real-world challenges faced by humans. CollPlant, one of the companies he helped found, is attempting to bioengineer solutions to these problems by cloning human DNA onto tobacco plants. “I have no doubt that we’ll be able to produce a human heart in the laboratory,” he says. “This heart is not going to be the same as a human heart, it’s going to be better.” One of the more established players in both Silicon Valley and its Middle Eastern rival is Intel Corp., which set up a research and production operation in Israel in 1972. Intel Israel has since grown to the point where it has become Israel’s largest private employer, with more than 10,200 workers on its payroll as of last year. According to Maxine Fassberg, executive in residence and vice president of Intel Capital, the company exported $3.35 billion of chips and other products from Israel last year, accounting for 1 percent to 2 percent of the country’s GDP. In addition to the tech developments fostered by Intel, Fassberg credits both Israel’s defense sector and its academia for propelling this development. “The bottom line is the people and the quality of the education there,” she says. For his part, Dr. Yaron Daniely, chief executive of Yissum, Hebrew University’s technology transfer arm, and himself the driving force behind many Israeli developments in medical technology, credits the amazing performance of Israeli R&D to “chutzpah,” shown in the willingness of the country’s scientists and entrepreneurs to take on risk. “Exceptional people exist everywhere who are more creative than others, but that doesn’t guarantee success,” he points out. “We were arrogant Israelis. We didn’t think that we were stupid.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under israel ,  patents ,  silicon valley ,  tel aviv Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 42,692 Hamptons bachelors are getting vasectomies so golddiggers can't trap them 28,986 Sportswriter slammed for 'racist' tweet about Indy 500 winner 17,308 Middle schoolers refuse to pose with Paul Ryan during photo op Now On Nicole Kidman and others win big at Cannes Film Festival Orlando Bloom’s insane workout almost killed him Jamie Foxx under fire for mocking sign language SEE ALL Video 0:47 After 17 years of trying to conceive, woman gives birth to sextuplets Now On 10 Shocking Stories Behind Famous Sex Scenes SEE ALL More Stories page six Heidi Klum bares all in sexy new photo book Now On Decider 10 Movies Where The Actors Had Real Sex On Camera nypost Hamptons bachelors are getting vasectomies so golddiggers can't trap them New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The best gaming desktop you can buy The best gaming desktop you can buy Our favorite gaming desktops make the latest consoles look pathetic By Jayce Wagner — Updated May 27, 2017 12:00 pm Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Finding the right gaming desktop can be a serious chore. Sorting through Amazon feedback, spec sheets, and parsing countless reviews for details relevant to your needs can be a massive headache, but we’re here to help. It seems like we get new gaming desktops to review every week, and each one comes with its own quirks and eccentricities. Let’s be honest, the internals in all the top-of-the-line desktops are going to be remarkably similar. When you’re buying a high-end gaming desktop you should be on the lookout for more than just raw performance. Any machine in the same price category will be capable of hitting similar benchmarks. What you’re really looking for in a long term solution is something with manageable quirks, features and eccentricities. You want a gaming desktop that reflects you and your needs, without compromising its horsepower. Most of all, a gaming computer should be fun, so we’ve got the picks to keep the whole process from turning into a stressful mess. Our pick Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Why you should buy this: You’re in it for the long haul, you want the best gaming rig on the market, and you want to keep it up to date. [needs product card] Who it’s for: Gamers who want the best of the best, and don’t mind dropping some serious dough How much will it cost: $1,300+, depending on specs Why we picked the Digital Storm Velox Not only does Digital Storm’s Velox own the distinction of housing Intel’s Core i7-7700K processor — it also overclocked that processor to a ridiculous 5GHz, and cleared our tests with flying colors. Simply put, the Velox is among the most powerful gaming desktops you can buy. And if the i7-7700K isn’t to your tastes, well, you can get a Core i7-6950X, or AMD’s new Ryzen processors. Despite its speed and extravagance, opening up the Velox and tinkering with its innards is far less intimidating than performing the same process on other rigs, due to its intuitive case design, which eschews screws and buttons in favor of simple pegs that pop in and out with little effort. You can essentially trick out the Velox to no end (playing with options on Digital Storm’s website, we managed to jack the overall price up to over $40,000), but our review model ran short of $5,000, and it absolutely hauled digital ass. Altogether, the Velox is hard to beat — on top of being incredibly powerful, it looks great, and it’s easy to fiddle with. If you want a future-proof PC, this is just about your best bet. Our review The best compact gaming desktop Why you should buy this: You’re looking for something small, dense, and deceptively powerful (like a neutron star). Our Score The Best Compact Gaming Desktop Falcon Northwest Tiki (2015) If you want something a little smaller, the Tiki is a fantastic machine, with a gaming aesthetic and satisfying growl when you turn it on. $4,045.00 from Falcon Northwest Who it’s for: Gamers who want compact, understated power How much will it cost: $1,900 – $4,200, depending on specs Why we picked the Falcon Northwest Tiki The Tiki actually scored a little better than the Velox in our review, but they’re very different machines. Digital Storm’s desktop is a powerhouse, and that’s reflected in its aesthetic; the custom metal chassis is certainly a joy to behold, but we wouldn’t classify it as minimalistic. Sure, it’s less flashy than many gaming rigs, but it’s still eye-catching, and takes up a decent chunk of real estate. The Tiki takes after a different tradition, trading visuals and a luxuriant interior for economy of space. This thing is tiny. It’s also a good choice if you’re averse to some of the flashier gaming PCs out there. Not everyone has a taste for neon red and flashing lights. Like most high-end gaming rigs, you can customize the appearance of the Tiki, but there’s something about its sleek, professional design that lends itself well to shades of black. If the Origin is a cherry-red hot rod with racing stripes, the Tiki is a slick black sports coupe with tinted windows and growling engine. Really, it growls. It’s a little loud, particularly under a heavy load, but given how small it is, you could tuck this thing under your desk to muffle the worst of the fan noise. Or just sit it out in the open and enjoy the sound of a miniature jet engine. There are quieter gaming PCs out there, but you might have to make a few compromises. Our review The best affordable gaming desktop [Couldn’t find any lifestyle images, Dell’s press kits suck] Why you should buy this: You want performance without breaking the bank, or a tiny gaming desktop. [Also needs product card :D] Who it’s for: Budget-minded gamers who don’t need unnecessary bells and whistles How much will it cost: $700 Why we picked the Alienware Alpha ASM100-9000BLK  Not everyone wants (or is able) to spend thousands on a gaming PC. Luckily, there are potent options out there for even the most frugal gamers, and Alienware’s Alpha Mini series is at the top of the list. Alienware often catches flak for pumping out flashy, LED-laden computers that are too expensive, boasting similar specs to machines made by other companies at higher prices. That’s simply not the case with the ASM100-9000BLK, which currently retails for just $700 via Amazon. If you’re a fiend for gorgeous graphics, you can find better options, but few — if any — desktops offer the same level of power as the Alpha for such a reasonable price. At 1080p, but it’ll play demanding games like The Witcher 3 and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor at 60FPS without breaking a sweat. The CPU, memory, and hard drive are replaceable, so if you need a solid state drive in place of the slower hard drive, you can make that happen (though that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a $700 gaming desktop). The barebones, gaming-centric Alienware UI is designed to be easily navigable via gamepad or controller, and on this front it succeeds. The Alpha manages to feel like a gaming console, except with Steam’s massive library. If you’re looking for an all-purpose PC, look elsewhere, but this bad boy packs a lot of punch, considering its size and price. How we test You’ve read our reviews. You’ve read our conclusions. And now you’re wondering how we came to them. Reviews often lack context. We’ll give out a score and analyze the finer points of desktop performance, but how do we reach those conclusions? How do we test these machines? Allow us to lift the veil. Here we’ll explain the benchmarks we use for objective testing and the perspective from which we approach subjective topics. We don’t expect everyone to agree with our opinions, but we hope that sharing our process will leave you better equipped to decide what desktop best fits your needs.

Official today, the ARM Cortex-A75 is the new flagship-tier mobile processor design, with a claimed 22 percent improvement in performance over the incumbent A73. It’s joined by the new Cortex-A55, which has the highest power efficiency of any mid-range CPU ARM’s ever designed, and the Mali-G72 graphics processor, which also comes with a 25 percent improvement in efficiency relative to its predecessor G71. The efficiency improvements are evolutionary and predictable, but the revolutionary aspects of this new lineup relate to artificial intelligence: this is the first set of processing components designed specifically to tackle the challenges of onboard AI and machine learning. Plus, last year’s updates to improve performance in the power-hugry tasks of augmented and virtual reality are being extended and elaborated. Before we dive into the detail of this year’s changes, it’s worth recapping what ARM does and why it’s important. This English company, now owned by Japan’s SoftBank, is responsible for designing the processor architecture of practically every mobile device — you’ll have heard of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon, Samsung’s Exynos, and Apple’s A-series of mobile chips, all of which are built using ARM’s instruction sets and based on ARM’s design blueprints. When we talk about the oncoming wave of mobile AI, mobile VR, and smartphones that can perform machine-learning tasks without sending them off to processor farms up in the cloud, developing the capabilities for those tasks starts with ARM. ARM The new Cortex-A75 and A55 are the first Dynamiq CPUs from ARM. Dynamiq is the branding chosen to describe a much more flexible set of design options for silicon vendors like Qualcomm. Where previously ARM allowed for designs that paired a cluster of so-called big CPUs (from its A7x class) and a matched number of little CPUs (from the A5x series), the new design makes it possible to spec a single, mixed-up cluster composed of both big and little CPUs, to a maximum of eight. Thus, chip makers can now have, for example, seven little A55 cores and just one big A75 one: for a favorable mix of long battery life, cost efficiency, and a high ceiling of single-threaded performance when it’s called for. "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years" ARM marketing chief John Ronco says he anticipates a "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years thanks to better architecture, micro-architecture, and software optimizations." ARM’s Dynamiq changes include a redesigned memory subsystem and tweaks to how CPU caches work — which has led to a doubling of memory streaming performance on the A55 relative to the A53 preceding it. Given that the A53 has shipped on 1.7 billion devices over the past three years, it’s truly the A55 that will make the biggest difference in achieving Ronco’s ambitious forecast. In most applications, the new mid-range core will be 10 to 30 percent better than previously, offering up to 15 percent better power efficiency and 18 percent better single-thread performance. But it’s the fact that the new chip designs will be 10 times more configurable, with up to 3,000 different configurations, that will allow chipmakers far greater flexibility to make the most of them by tailoring them to specific tasks. ARM The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board Interestingly, ARM won’t just be powering machine learning with its new chips, it’ll benefit from ML too. The new designs benefit from an improved branch predictor that uses neural network algorithms to improve data prefetching and overall performance. The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board, with ARM claiming it’s on average 22 percent better than the A73, with 16 percent higher memory throughput, and a 34 percent improvement in its Geekbench score. Single-threaded performance, according to ARM’s Ronco, is up by 20 percent, purely by improving the instructions-per-clock efficiency. The A75 chip is roughly 2.5x the size of the A55, and its intended uses are for infrastructure, automotive, and rich mobile applications. Yes, that means VR, AR, and high-fidelity games, the latter of which ARM’s research has shown have been rapidly increasing in popularity. A major architectural change with the A75 is the opening of a larger power envelope for chips using this core, scaling up to 2W of power consumption, and thus offering up to 30 percent of extra performance on larger-screen devices. This is entirely targeted at the upcoming Windows on ARM reboot, expected later this year. It’s worth noting that in ARM’s world a "large" screen basically amounts to a laptop — and the company set up a dedicated Large Screen Compute division a year and a half ago to more aggressively target the clamshell devices that Intel has been dominant in. ARM As to the new Mali GPU, it has 32 shader cores, 25 percent higher energy efficiency, and a 20 percent better performance density (aka performance per mm² of space). The Mali-G72 is at the heart of ARM’s push toward improving machine learning efficiency, and ARM claims it’s showing itself to be 17 percent better than the G71 in ML benchmarks. The design optimizations from the company are tailored to accelerate inference engines rather than training engines — that’s to say ARM chips will be best at using accumulated ML capabilities rather than developing them, which makes perfect sense for mobile applications. Training AI will be a task better left to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards or Google’s custom TensorFlow TPUs. The Cortex-A75 and A55 designs were released to ARM’s partners at the end of 2016, so by this point, they’ve all had a few months to decide what to do with them. ARM says a "realistic time window" for new mobile devices powered by its latest designs would be the first quarter of 2018 — though the company is also conscious of a new phenomenon it describes as "China speed," where Chinese phone vendors will put its designs into products almost immediately. The Huawei Mate 9, for example, was released just eight months after ARM distributed the Mali-G71 to partners. This faster Chinese cadence could lead to some A75- and A55-based designs this year, but then bulk of them are likely to arrive with the usual smartphone refresh cycle early next year.

Sleek and slim, the 2016 machine packs a lot of power in its portable frame. There is just one problem, however. For power users, the 2016 MBP simply does not have enough horsepower to justify its “Pro” moniker and its premium price. If a noted Apple analyst is to be believed, however, the MacBook Pro 2017 might very well address all of the 2016 model’s issues sooner than expected. According to a MacWorld report, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a pretty solid track record with regards to his predictions about the tech giant, has stated that the entire Mac lineup would see an update this year. This includes the MacBook Pro, which would be given a processor boost and an upgrade on memory. While a processor and memory boost might appear to be marginal upgrades to the popular professional-grade laptop, these improvements would actually go a long way in establishing the MacBook Pro 2017 as a serious productivity machine capable of handling the most arduous tasks that users could throw at it. Currently, the Skylake chip-8GB RAM configuration of the device is good enough for basic productivity tasks, but when users attempt some serious video or image creation, the 2016 MBP struggles. My weapon blacked out. A post shared by Julian O'hayon (@anckor) on May 27, 2017 at 10:14am PDT The MacBook Pro is currently Apple’s most powerful laptop, but it could be so much better. According to persistent rumors about the upcoming device, the professional-grade laptop would be released with Intel’s Kaby Lake chips this coming June during Apple’s WWDC 2017 event. The Kaby Lake chips would not be all that the laptops would be equipped with, however, as the MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to be fitted with 16GB of RAM as well, which is double the amount that was featured in the 2016 models. Kuo even stated that a higher-end MacBook Pro, possibly a 15-inch model, would launch with 32GB of RAM late this year, which would all but make Apple’s professional-grade laptops worthy of their moniker. If any, the signs that Apple is preparing for an update in its lineup have begun appearing. Over the past few months, numerous Apple products, from the iPad Pro to the MacBook Pro 2016, have started going on sale, as noted by AppleInsider. If the Cupertino-based tech giant’s reputation is any indication, sales and promotions on outgoing models usually indicate that newer products would replace them soon. Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook Pro was a gamble that did not pay off as much as Apple expected. While the sleek machines boasted numerous advancements and new features that were not found in their predecessors, they were unfortunately held back by the design choices that the Cupertino-based tech giant rolled out for the computers. Among these is the retirement of legacy ports in favor of USB-C, which resulted in users scrambling to acquire dongles to get basic tasks done, as well as the removal of popular features such as the MagSafe power connector. Kick off your morning off on the right foot. #chillmorning #classicalmusic #coffee #macbookpro #latte #bestpartofwakingup A post shared by Kevin Yeager (@the_simple_cyclist) on May 28, 2017 at 5:13pm PDT Even the Touch Bar, arguably the MacBook Pro 2017’s most iconic feature, has been met with mixed reviews from users as of date. While the feature is undoubtedly novel, and while it does provide a new way for users to interact with their laptops, many have stated that the Touch Bar is not that useful in real-world applications at all. If any, the advantages of the Touch Bar are far outweighed by the compromises that Apple took when designing the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 2017 MacBook Pro would largely be the same device that was released last year. It would still have the same upgrade restrictions, the same lack of legacy ports and its Touch Bar would still be not as useful. Nevertheless, the added power that he Kaby Lake processors would give, and the ease of use that a RAM upgrade would provide, would surely be appreciated by consumers and avid Apple fans alike. Ultimately, such a push in specs would make the MacBook Pro 2017 worthy of its name.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI SAN FRANCISCO: A total of 34 artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in AI or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specialises in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested US$1bil in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of AI to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Startups Related Stories Related Stories Rocket Internet narrows losses, boosts sales at key startups Research tool to track animals’ brain activity US startups load up on debt "Investing for good' gains appeal amid rocky tech startup market Discontent among startup community in Sweden You May Be Interested Market to continue range-bound trading Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Neighbourhood’s odd location an issue for gated-and-guarded scheme Choo’s fond memories of Di Barca duo not ready for senior Korean side - Stielike Property Related advertisement Latest News S&P sees no need for an out-of-schedule China rating review Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Market to continue range-bound trading Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Most Viewed in Business AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Bank Negara kicks off fintech sandbox Boustead records RM2.38bil revenue YTL REIT buys Majestic Hotel for RM380mil cash Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Online traders must register with CCM Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar ML Global banks on orderbook to sustain Zukri: Islamic banking sector ripe for M&As Foreign buying stretches to 16 consecutive weeks advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls    U.S. May Ban Carry-On Laptops For All International Flights Ted Goodman 6:19 PM 05/28/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly said Sunday that he is considering expanding the laptop ban to include all international flights. “Are you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the U.S.?” Fox News Sunday’s host Chris Wallace asked Kelly. “I might. That’s a quick answer,” Kelly responded. Kelly told Wallace that terrorists are obsessed with the idea of knocking down an airplane in mid-flight, especially if it’s a U.S. carrier full of Americans. He would not say when a decision on expanding the ban would be made, but told Wallace that he would follow the intelligence. “The very, very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world,” Kelly said. “There’s new technologies down the road, not too far down the road, that we will rely on,” Kelly told Wallace. “But it is a real sophisticated threat and I will reserve that decision until we see where it’s going.” DHS implemented restrictions on electronic devices larger than a cell phone on board aircraft flying into the United States from 10 airports located in eight majority-Muslim countries in late March. (RELATED: DHS: Airline Electronics Ban Based On New Intel) The decision to implement the policy in March came after new intelligence indicated that terrorist groups have “intensified” attempts to attack flights mid-air. “Our information indicates that terrorist groups’ efforts to execute an attack against the aviation sector are intensifying,” DHS said in a March 21 press release. While rumors swirled that DHS was considering an expansion of the ban to include flights from the European Union (EU), officials seemed to push back on that notion during talks in mid-May. During a May 17 meeting between the EU and DHS officials, they reached an agreement to take the ban “off the table for now,” according to the Associated Press. They shared details about aviation security standards and agreed to discuss the topic further. “The United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to continue working closely together on aviation security generally, including meeting next week in Washington D.C. to further assess shared risks and solutions for protecting airline passengers, whilst ensuring the smooth functioning of global air travel,” members of the organizations said in a joint statement. The aviation sector is under constant threat from terrorist groups because of the ability to inflict a mass casualty event and the global media attention that follows. Terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer products,” according to CNN. Officials cited the 2015 airliner downing in Egypt, the 2016 attempted airliner downing in Somalia, and the 2016 attacks against airports in Brussels and Istanbul as examples of terror-related incidents involving aviation targets.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Tech giants acquired 34 AI startups in Q1 2017 Reuters May 28, 2017 9:33 AM Above: Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, onstage at Google I/O 2017. (Reuters) – A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

Senator Bob Corker, a conservative Republican from Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, dubbed Trump the "wrecking ball president." Now this wrecking ball is damaging America's alliance with Europe and its procedures for handling the country’s most sensitive secrets, leaving U.S. military and intelligence, and their foreign counterparts, aghast. Trump’s habitual carelessness is dangerous, they say. In his speech to NATO leaders Thursday he scolded them for failing to live up commitments to increase defense spending while failing to mention Article 5, the NATO mutual-defense pledge — something other leaders had been hoping to hear. The Associated Press described the speech as an "unprecedented one-two punch" that "further rattled" an already anxious Europe. One Democratic leader called the remarks "condescending" and an "embarrassment." And that was before Trump described the Germans as "evil, very evil" for running a trade surplus with the United States. The trail of wreckage left by Trump's big mouth is growing longer by the day. Intel on ISIS On May 15, the Washington Post reported that Trump had revealed highly classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in a White House meeting. “This is code-word information,” said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” The details emerged over the next week. The information, obtained from Israel, concerned specific terrorist plotting by the Islamic State, including Islamic State advances in bomb-making that could be used to mask an explosive device inside a laptop, according to USA Today. Trump’s defense quickly fell apart. He claimed he never mentioned Israel in his talks with the Russians. Whether that is literally true or whether he was lying (again), doesn’t really matter. Israeli officials were “furious” about the disclosures, Foreign Policy reported, and Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman acknowledged that Israel had “tweaked its intelligence-sharing protocols" with the United States after Trump’s off-script remarks. “I can confirm that we did a spot repair and that there’s unprecedented intelligence cooperation with the United States,” Lieberman told Israeli Army Radio. “What we had to clarify with our friends in the United States, we did. We did our check.” Former CIA director John Brennan testified Tuesday that if the president shared classified Israeli intelligence with Russian officials at the White House as reported, he violated intelligence-sharing protocol. “It appears as though, at least from the press reports, that neither did it go in the proper channels nor did the originating agency have the opportunity to clear language for it,” Brennan said. “That is a problem." Submarine Location Then came the disclosure that Trump had told Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that the U.S. had two nuclear submarines stationed near North Korea. “We have a lot of firepower over there,” Trump said, according to a transcript obtained by The Intercept. “We have two submarines—best in the world—we have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all.” BuzzFeed News reported that "Pentagon officials are in shock after the release of a transcript between President Donald Trump and his Philippines counterpart reveals that the U.S. military had moved two nuclear submarines towards North Korea. 'We never talk about subs!' three U.S. officials said." Rank and file military personnel also expressed surprise at the breach of normal security procedures. @CitizensFedUp @sartorialskwirl @BraddJaffy I am a Navy wife, my husband was on subs. WE were never allowed to know where they were or allowed to talk about the dates of deployment — Kate Jones (@katejns8) May 25, 2017 A Pattern In February, Trump "astounded" White House veterans with his decision to turn the public terrace of his Florida home into a situation room after he learned of a North Korea missile launch. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe remained at the table and discussed their response. "While waiters came and went — and while one club member snapped photos — the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aide’s cellphone,” the Washington Post reported, adding that presidents typically “move to private, secured settings to hash out such an event.” In fact, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has an on-site Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a specially outfitted room for storing top-secret records and holding confidential conversations. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1420251685282-2'); });The White House denied any classified information had been seen or discussed at the impromptu dinner table conference, but that hardly addresses the qualms of security professionals. “Assuming the smartphones staffers held aloft were consumer devices, they’re basically bugs waiting for someone to activate them,” noted Wire’s Brian Barrett. “Android phones are notoriously insecure outside of the most recent update, and even then aren’t guaranteed safe." “The idea that somebody could target these phones is not science fiction,” says Matthew Green, cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s actually a pretty standard, well-understood threat.” Not by the president of the United States, it seems. _______ About author Jefferson Morley is AlterNet's Washington correspondent.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) have been on a volatile ride this month. AMD stock came into May hot, up 20%. Shares subsequently lost 24% after AMD missed revenue estimates and reported in-line earnings results. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Those losses were seemingly in the rearview mirror when, in mid-May, rumors of a licensing deal between AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) materialized. No comment from the company and denial from Intel caused those gains to fade though. Moving Forward with Advanced Micro Devices Shares are still down about 19% for the month of May. Despite the decline, Advanced Micro Devices is still up a whopping 184% over the past 12 months. Investors now need to figure out if it’s time to bail on AMD stock or get in on the action. A big part of AMD’s story is execution. Basically, can management deliver? Over the past six quarters, AMD has beaten EPS estimates four times and had in-line results the other two. In that same span, Advanced Micro Devices has beaten revenue estimates five times. Not to get too historical, but AMD didn’t have one beat in either category for the six quarters prior to that period. So, to say management is improving would be an understatement. Analysts expect earnings of 7 cents per share in 2017. It would be a big deal if AMD were to become profitable this year, after four years of losses. Building on that momentum, analysts expect ~330% earnings growth in 2018 to 30 cents per share. This is where management’s execution comes into play. Advanced Micro’s debt picture is another reason for optimism. In June, AMD was carrying $2.24 billion in debt. As of last quarter, that figure stood at just $1.41 billion, a reduction of 37%. Finally, there’s valuation. As AMD works toward profitability, its earnings-based valuation is just okay. But, on a sales-basis, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t too bad. In fact, trading at 2.33x trailing sales is lower than both Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). On a forward sales basis, AMD is also cheaper. Trading AMD Stock AMD gives bullish traders a good opening – albeit, a slight one. Support currently sits at the 200-day moving average, around $10.10. Below that, the stock is pretty iffy. Source: Stockcharts.com That’s good for bulls and bears alike though. Bulls can use this level, or one close to it, as their stop-loss. AMD stock should rally should that level hold, although it could have trouble clearing $12.50. Previously serving as support, this level will now likely act as resistance and give AMD stock limited upside. Make no mistake about it, AMD suffered some big damage when it fell on earnings. But, a run back to $12.50 would represent a 15%-20% return, depending on where investors buy the stock. The Intel-rumor rally gave hope to bullish momentum returning. But, its negative reaction could cause the MACD to turn bearish once more (purple circle). That’s what gives bears some hope. Should the MACD turn bearish – the black line falling below the red line – and the $10 level give way as support, bears will be in control. In that case, there’s no real way to know how much downside could exist. But, one thing would be certain: Bulls would be in trouble. At least in the short-term, then, being long AMD would be painful. In the current case of Advanced Micro Devices, the advantage goes to bulls, for now. But, that will change if AMD stock falls below $10.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Data Center Security Market to Reach US$11.77 bn by 2022, Propelled by Increasing Adoption of Cloud Computing Transparency Market Research has published a new report on the global data center security market. According to the report, the global data center security market stood at US$4 bn in 2013 and is predicted to reach US$11.77 bn by 2022. The report, titled ‘Data Center Security Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2014 – 2022,’ states that the market is predicted to expand at a 12.60% CAGR from 2014 to 2022 owing to factors such as the rising security concerns of businesses and personal data and the increasing incidence of data center attacks. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/data-center-security-m… A data center is a storage system or an archive, which comprises of facilities such as firewalls, servers, switches, and routers. Data centers contain security facilities such as a suppression system, air conditioning system for maintaining the temperature, and backup machinery. As per their storage requirements, different sizes of data centers are used by organizations. Data centers are a pivotal part of a company’s information system (IS). The availability of low-cost alternatives and the lack of awareness about data center security systems are predicted to hamper the growth of the global data center security market in the near future. However, the increasing adoption of virtualization services, the increasing investments in the Internet of Things (IoT), and emerging economies are expected to create growth opportunities in the global data center security market in the next few years. Also, many large-scale organizations are changing their focus from traditional storage solutions to advanced data centers. The number of data centers is expected to increase in Asia Pacific nations. With this, the global data center security market is expected to benefit considerably in the near future. The global data center security market is segmented on the basis of region and component. By component, the global data center security market is classified into logical components, physical components, and services. The logical components segment is sub-segmented into threat and application security, data protection, and access control and compliance. In 2013, the logical components segment held a share of more than 85% in the global data center security market. Based on region, the global data center security market is divided into Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. In 2013, North America accounted for 40% of the global data center security market and is predicted to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Changing government rules for data security and privacy are predicted to propel the North America data center security market in the near future. Going forward, Europe and Asia Pacific are predicted to be promising markets for data center security. Fill the form for an exclusive sample of this report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Technological developments have benefited the global data center security market considerably.

Best Buy fitness watches for 2017 Find out which fitness watches and activity trackers can help you get the best results, and which ones you should avoid By Alison Potter 29 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Our latest series of test of wearables has uncovered an excellent Best Buy fitness watch that outperforms others costing more than twice the price. But it also found a malfunctioning device with a fleeting battery life and unresponsive controls, which is expensive to boot. The batch included five of the latest feature-packed fitness watches, ranging in price from £120 up to £325. It also included three fitness trackers which have traditional analogue watch faces and hidden activity tracking features, making them ideal for the style conscious who want to be able to discreetly record their steps. If you’re buying a new wearable device, you want to make sure it’s money well spent. At Which? we fully test every facet of a fitness watch or fitness tracker. We leave no stone unturned when it comes to examining just how accurately a wearable can measure your heart rate, how precisely the built-in GPS measures distance and whether the battery will barely muster a day or if it will keep going for a month. Scroll down to find out more about the latest wearables we’ve tested and whether they are worth investing in. For more help finding a perfect wearable device for your wrist, check out our fitness watch reviews and fitness tracker reviews.   New 2017 fitness watches on test TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music Unlike most fitness watches, TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music has 3GB of memory, which equates to roughly 500 songs. This means you can listen to music as you exercise without having to lug your smartphone about with you, too. It also has a slew of features for tracking running, cycling and swimming, including a wrist-based heart-rate monitor, in-built GPS and an accelerometer. To find out just how accurately it takes each reading, and how consistent it is in taking measurements, we repeated a number of different scenarios including a 5km woodland run. See if it managed to nail our tests by heading over to our TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music review. TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music Despite its name, TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music doesn’t just track running, but cycling, swimming and cardio sessions in the gym. Although it has a different strap to TomTom’s Spark 3 Cardio + Music and a slightly different name, it looks to be essentially the same watch and it uses the same TomTom Sports companion app. But if you want to know whether it performed identically to the Spark 3 in our tests, and if it’s a fitness watch that will push you to break your personal best, read our comprehensive TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music review. Garmin Forerunner 35 The Forerunner 35 is a surprisingly compact fitness watch and it weighs just 38g, which is 49g lighter than the Garmin Fenix 3 HR. It’s at the cheaper end of Garmin’s popular Forerunner range, but it still includes advanced fitness features such as a wrist-based heart-rate monitor and built-in GPS. It also has a water rating of 5ATM, which means you can wear it swimming and to a maximum depth of 50 metres. But is it a suitable fitness watch for keen swimmers and triathlon enthusiasts, and how long will the battery last before needing a charge? Read our Garmin Forerunner 35 review to find out what you need to know about this affordable fitness watch. NewBalance RunIQ The NewBalance RunIQ is a collaboration between sports-fashion brand New Balance and tech giant Intel. It boasts the latest Android Wear and Strava app compatibility, which is good news if you’re one of the millions who enjoys using Strava to track your exercise and compare your stats to other sportspeople who have taken the same route. Although it certainly looks good on paper, will the RunIQ blow fitness watches from established brands like Garmin and TomTom out of the water? Discover precisely what we loved about this wearable, and what we hated, by reading our NewBalance RunIQ review. Polar M200 Some fitness watches cost upwards of £300, but Polar’s M200 is priced at a very reasonable £120. Although it’s primarily intended for runners, you can add more than 100 activity profiles to the watch, and Polar has an exhaustive list including specific exercise classes, swimming, table tennis and golf. Similar to other fitness watches, it has a heart-rate monitor and built-in GPS, but how will it stack up against its much more expensive competitors such as Garmin’s Forerunner 735XT? Check out the test results and tech specs, and find out how our test participants got on with it in our Polar M200 review. New 2017 fitness trackers on test Garmin Vivomove Some fitness trackers can be ugly, bulky or both, but the sleek Garmin Vivomove looks like a traditional analogue watch rather than a fitness device. The activity tracker comes in three designs; the ‘sport’ which is sold with a rubber strap and plastic bezel, the ‘classic’ which comes with a leather strap, and the ‘premium’ version which has an elegant silver or gold-coloured stainless-steel bezel. But does the way it looks affect how well it records your steps? And what else can it do in terms of activity tracking? See if this tracker sailed through our meticulous tests by heading over to our Garmin Vivomove review. Misfit Phase The Misfit Phase is a combination of conventional analogue watch, fitness tracker and smartwatch. The brand itself has called it a hybrid smartwatch, because as well as tracking your steps, distance travelled, calories burnt and sleep, it also gives colour-coded alerts for calls, texts, emails and some social media platforms. But do the features of the Misfit Phase add up to a fitness tracker or a smartwatch? And is it any good as either? We assessed it in our test lab to find out and you can see how we got on in our Misfit Phase review. Withings Steel HR The unassuming Withings Steel HR looks like an analogue watch, but it has an OLED screen, a built-in heart-rate monitor, and can track steps taken, distance travelled, calories burnt and your sleep. It’s also waterproof to 50 metres so you can wear it in the pool, but that’s only advisable with the standard silicone strap as opposed to the separately bought leather strap. If that’s not enough, Withings claims that it has the longest battery life of any heart-rate tracker on the market. How will it compare to the other 40 fitness trackers we’ve tested? Head to our full Withings Steel HR review to discover whether it’s worthy of a place on your wrist.

The new Surface Pro will be available on June 15 starting at $799, but you can also opt for a demo version in Microsoft Stores. The enemy The Surface Pro is here to compete with Apple. Ryan Day from Microsoft made it clear that they designed Surface Pro for people who possess an iPad Pro. And I think the new Surface Pro is a lot closer to being a laptop replacement, unlike the 12.9inch iPad Pro. The Keyboard The Microsoft Keyboards always stand out. The new Surface Pro Type Cover Keyboard have a tiny distance between the keys which is a lot easier for all the fast typers out there, distance to fully push down a key and great tactile feedback. However, there are two issues that need improvement: The Keyboard Material The Alcantara material feels nice and looks good and is a high-end product, (you obviously need to take care of it) but over time it can become a little bit of a problem. The majority of laptops opt for all-metal surfaces because it’s more durable and difficult to stain. I’m not quite sure if the Alcantra will overdue the all-metal design option for the devices but we’ll see after a period of time. The Keyboard Is Selling Separately The Surface Pro is clearly nothing without the Type Cover Keyboard. It’s like buying a laptop without a keyboard and you need to pay an extra $160 for it, because $1,299 wasn’t much at all. Also, it comes in four different colors, giving users the possibility to choose one for their own taste. Baterry Life With a new Intel 7th Gen Core processor, the new Surface Pro boasts 50% longer battery life than the older version, meaning 13.5 hours rather than 9 on the Surface Pro 4. Display It has 12.3inch and a 2736px1824p (267ppi) resolution. The New Surface Pen It is selling separately for $99 with tilt support and 4096 levels of sensitivity pressure, perfect for those who use the device for making art.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Apple bringing artificial intelligence to chips Booming field: A man uses his phone as he walks past an Apple store in Beijing. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence – such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices currently handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it is unclear if the component would be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also planned to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple planned to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops.

Wright, George Mason University School of Law; and Edwin S. Rockefeller, Former Chairman, ABA Section of Antitrust Law, and author of The Antitrust Religion. Moderated by Douglas H. Ginsburg, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On May 11, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney announced plans to restore an aggressive enforcement policy against corporations that engage in anti-competitive behavior. Specifically, the Justice Department was revoking legal guidelines that were adopted in September 2008 that made it more difficult to pursue antitrust cases. “The recent developments in the marketplace should make it clear that we can no longer rely upon the marketplace alone to ensure that competition and consumers will be protected,” explained the new head of the Antitrust Division. This policy reversal could be a shot across the bow of the tech industry, with Google and Intel now fearing the sort of legal action that plagued Microsoft in the 1990s. But should the government be going after profitable companies during weak economic times? What makes a merger anti-competitive or a business action monopolistic? How much does antitrust enforcement ultimately benefit the consumer?

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: The main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field.

Bloomberg says the chip’s called the Apple Neural Engine internally, and could be used for “offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip.” By moving AI processing to a dedicated chip, battery life in devices could also see a boost since the main CPU and GPU wouldn’t be crunching as much data and gobbling as much power. The report says Apple plans to integrate the chip into its devices, but it’s unclear when that’ll happen, and if any iOS devices launching this year will have it. Apple’s work on an AI chip shouldn’t surprise anyone who’s paying attention to the competition. Virtually every tech company is working on improving AI processing on mobile devices. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chip, which is already in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a special module dedicated to processing AI tasks. Years ago, Apple started designing its own mobile processors to improve performance and reduce power consumption, and it’s really paid off. Despite having fewer cores, the iPhone 7 still crushes the Galaxy S8 when it comes to sheer performance. iPhones and iPads also come with an Apple-designed “M”-branded motion coprocessor to collect sensor data from the various included sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.). It’s this M chip that helps with tracking health and fitness data. Furthermore, in addition to the main Intel processors in the new MacBook Pros, there’s also a small Apple-made “T1” chip for powering the Touch Bar. Apple’s AirPods also have a custom W1 chip that helps with pairing them to iOS devices. Clearly, Apple loves making custom chips for things. We’re all for it, especially if that means longer battery life. If the future is AI everywhere (and it definitely looks like that’s where things are headed), it’s in Apple’s best interests to control the stack (like it always does) with its own AI chip. – Source: Mashable Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones More on citifmonline.com British Airways flights cancelled amid IT crash May 27, 2017 Subtitling systems contain ‘widespread’ security threat May 27, 2017 Mark Zuckerberg returns to Harvard to collect honorary degree May 26, 2017 Google AI defeats human Go champion May 26, 2017 Instagram’s new feature helps you clean up your profile without deleting May 25, 2017 Nokia 3310 sparks wave of nostalgia as it goes on sale May 24, 2017 General News Water production improves after galamsey fight – GWCL May 29, 2017 No gov’t interference in new national airline – Aviation Minister May 29, 2017 Western Region fishermen defy order on illegal fishing May 28, 2017 Woman killed after building collapses in Assin Akropong May 28, 2017 AMA must decongest Accra to reduce fires – Fire Service May 28, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts Solomon Asante adjudged SWAG footballer of the year The Square wins Palme d’Or at Cannes Film Festival North Korea fires third test missile in three weeks Email reveals Jacob Zuma ‘plans second home in Dubai’ Water production improves after galamsey fight – GWCL The unnecessary political twist and turn of the GHs9.7bn bond [Article] Law students to rewrite exams on June 5 No gov’t interference in new national airline – Aviation Minister KMA denies buying vehicles for assembly members Western Region fishermen defy order on illegal fishing Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.
