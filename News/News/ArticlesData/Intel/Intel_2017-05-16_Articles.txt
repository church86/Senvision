Intel's groundbreaking 8008 microprocessor was first produced 45 years ago.1 This chip, Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, is the ancestor of the x86 processor family that you may be using right now. I couldn't find good die photos of the 8008, so I opened one up and took some detailed photographs. These new die photos are in this article, along with a discussion of the 8008's internal design. Die photograph of the 8008 microprocessor The photo above shows the tiny silicon die inside the 8008 package (click the image for a higher resolution photo). You can barely see the wires and transistors that make up the chip. The squares around the outside are the 18 pads that are connected to the external pins by tiny bond wires. You can see the text "8008" on the right edge of the chip and "© Intel 1971" on the lower edge. The initials HF appear on the top right for Hal Feeney, who did the chip's logic design and physical layout. (Other key designers of the 8008 were Ted Hoff, Stan Mazor, and Federico Faggin.) Inside the chip The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks of the chip. On the left is the 8-bit Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU), which performs the actual data computations.3 The ALU uses two temporary registers to hold its input values. These registers take up significant area on the chip, not because they are complex, but because they need large transistors to drive signals through the ALU circuitry. Die of the 8008 microprocessor showing major components. Below the registers is the carry look ahead circuitry. For addition and subtraction, this circuit computes all eight carry values in parallel to improve performance.2 Since the low-order carry depends on just the low-order bits, while the higher-order carries depend on multiple bits, the circuit block has a triangular shape. The triangular layout of the ALU is unusual. Most processors stack the circuitry for each bit into a regular rectangle (a bit-slice layout). The 8008, however, has eight blocks (one for each bit) arranged haphazardly to fit around the space left by the triangular carry generator. The ALU supports eight simple operations.3 In the center of the chip is the instruction register and the instruction decoding logic that determines the meaning of each 8-bit machine instruction. Decoding is done with a Programmable Logic Array (PLA), an arrangement of gates that matches bit patterns and generates the appropriate control signals for the rest of the chip. On the right are the storage blocks. The 8008's seven registers are in the upper right. In the lower right is the address stack, which consists of eight 14-bit address words. Unlike most processors, the 8008's call stack is stored on the chip instead of in memory. The program counter is just one of these addresses, making subroutine calls and returns very simple. The 8008 uses dynamic memory for this storage The physical structure of the chip is very close to the block diagram in the 8008 User's Manual (below), with blocks located on the chip in nearly the same positions as in the block diagram. Block diagram of the 8008 microprocessor, from the User's Manual. The structure of the chip What does the die photo show? For our purposes, the chip can be thought of as three layers. The diagram below shows a closeup of the chip, pointing out these layers. The topmost layer is the metal wiring. It is the most visible feature, and looks metallic (not surprisingly). In the detail below, these wires are mostly horizontal. The polysilicon layer is below the metal and appears orange under the microscope. A closeup of the 8008 die, showing the metal layer, the polysilicon, and the doped silicon. The foundation of the chip is the silicon wafer, which appears purplish-gray in the photo. Pure silicon is effectively an insulator. Regions of it are "doped" with impurities to create semiconducting silicon. Being on the bottom, the silicon layer is difficult to distinguish, but you can see black lines along the border between doped silicon and undoped silicon. A few vertical silicon "wires" are visible in the photo.4 Transistors are the key component of the chip, and a transistor is formed where a polysilicon wire crosses doped silicon. In the photo, the polysilicon appears as a brighter orange where it forms a transistor. Why an 18 pin chip? One inconvenient feature of the 8008 is it only has 18 pins, which makes the chip slower and much more difficult to use. The 8008 uses 14 address bits and 8 data bits so with 18 pins there aren't enough pins for each signal. Instead, the chip has 8 data pins that are reused in three cycles to transmit the low address bits, high address bits, and data bits. A computer using the 8008 requires many support chips to interact with this inconvenient bus architecture.5 There was no good reason to force the chip into 18 pins. Packages with 40 or 48 pins were common with other manufacturers, but 16 pins was "a religion at Intel".6 Only with great reluctance did they move to 18 pins. By the time the 8080 processor came out a few years later, Intel had come to terms with 40-pin chips. The 8080 was much more popular, in part because it had a simpler bus design permitted by the 40-pin package. Power and data paths in the chip The data bus provides data flow through the chip. The diagram below shows the 8-bit data bus of the 8008 with rainbow colors for the 8 data lines. The data bus connects to the 8 data pins along the outside of the upper half of the chip. The bus runs between the ALU on the left, the instruction register (upper center), and the registers and stack on the right. The bus is split on the left with half along each side of the ALU. Die photo of the 8008 microprocessor. The power bus is shown in red and blue. The data bus is shown with 8 rainbow colors. The red and blue lines show power routing. Power routing is an under-appreciated aspect of microprocessors. Power is routed in the metal layer due to its low resistance. But since there is only one metal layer in early microprocessors, power distribution must be carefully planned so the paths don't cross.7 The diagram above shows Vcc lines in blue and Vdd lines in red. Power is supplied through the Vcc pin on the left and the Vdd pin on the right, then branches out into thin, interlocking wires that supply all parts of the chip. The register file To show what the chip looks like in detail, I've zoomed in on the 8008's register file in the photo below. The register file consists of an 8 by 7 grid of dynamic RAM (DRAM) storage cells, each using three transistors to hold one bit.8 (You can see the transistors as the small rectangles where the orange polysilicon takes on a slightly more vivid color.) Each row is one of the 8008's seven 8-bit registers (A, B, C, D, E, H, L). On the left, you can see seven pairs of horizontal wires: the read select and write select lines for each register. At the top, you can see eight vertical wires to read or write the contents of each bit, along with 5 thicker wires to supply Vcc. Using DRAM for registers (rather than the more common static latches) is an interesting choice. Since Intel was primary a memory company at the time, I expect they chose DRAM due to their expertise in the area. The register file in the 8008. The chip has seven 8-bit registers: A, B, C, D, E, H, L How PMOS works The 8008 uses PMOS transistors. To simplify slightly, you can think of a PMOS transistor as a switch between two silicon wires, controlled by a gate input (of polysilicon). The switch closes when its gate input is low and it can pull its output high. If you're familiar with the NMOS transistors used in microprocessors like the 6502, PMOS may be a bit confusing because everything is backwards. A simple PMOS NAND gate can be constructed as shown below. When both inputs are high, the transistors are off and the resistor pulls the output low. When any input is low, the transistor will conduct, connecting the output to +5. Thus, the circuit implements a NAND gate. For compatibility with 5-volt TTL circuits, the PMOS gate (and thus the 8008) is powered with unusual voltages: -9V and +5V. A NAND gate implemented with PMOS logic. For technical reasons, the resistor is actually implemented with a transistor. The diagram below shows how the transistor is wired to act as a pull-down resistor. The detail on the right shows how this circuit appears on the chip. The -9V metal wire is at the top, the transistor is in the middle, and the output is the silicon wire at the bottom. In PMOS, a pull-down resistor (left) is implemented with a transistor (center). The photo on the right shows an actual pull-down in the 8008 microprocessor. History of the 8008 The 8008's complicated story starts with the Datapoint 2200, a popular computer introduced in 1970 as a programmable terminal. (Some people consider the Datapoint 2200 to be the first personal computer.) Rather than using a microprocessor, the Datapoint 2200 contained a board-sized CPU build from individual TTL chips. (This was the standard way to build a CPU in the minicomputer era.) Datapoint and Intel decided that it would be possible to replace this board with a single MOS chip, and Intel started the 8008 project to build this chip. A bit later, Texas Instruments also agreed to build a single-chip processor for Datapoint. Both chips were designed to be compatible with the Datapoint 2200's 8-bit instruction set and architecture. The 8008 processor was first described publicly in "Electronic Design", Oct 25, 1970. Although Intel claimed the chip would be delivered in January 1971, actual delivery was more than a year later in April, 1972. Around March 1971, Texas Instruments completed their processor chip, calling it the TMC 1795. After delaying the project, Intel finished the 8008 chip later, around the end of 1971. For a variety of reasons, Datapoint rejected both microprocessors and built a faster CPU based on newer TTL chips including the 74181 ALU chip. TI tried unsuccessfully to market the TMC 1795 processor to companies such as Ford, but ended up abandoning the processor, focusing on highly-profitable calculator chips instead. Intel, on the other hand, marketed the 8008 as a general-purpose microprocessor, which eventually led to the x86 architecture you're probably using right now. Although TI was first with the 8-bit processor, it was Intel who made their chip a success, creating the microprocessor industry. A family tree of the 8008 and some related processors. Black arrows indicate backwards compatibility. Light arrows indicate significant architecture changes. The diagram above summarizes the "family tree" of the 8008 and some related processors.10 The Datapoint 2200's architecture was used in the TMC 1795, the Intel 8008, and the next version Datapoint 220011. Thus, four entirely different processors were built using the Datapoint 2200's instruction set and architecture. The Intel 8080 processor was a much-improved version of the 8008. It significantly extended the 8008's instruction set and reordered the machine code instructions for efficiency. The 8080 was used in groundbreaking early microcomputers such as the Altair and the Imsai. After working on the 4004 and 8080, designers Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima left Intel to build the Zilog Z-80 microprocessor, which improved on the 8080 and became very popular. The jump to the 16-bit 8086 processor was much less evolutionary. Most 8080 assembly code could be converted to run on the 8086, but not trivially, as the instruction set and architecture were radically changed. Nonetheless, some characteristics of the Datapoint 2200 still exist in today's x86 processors. For instance, the Datapoint 2200 had a serial processor, processing bytes one bit at a time. Since the lowest bit needs to be processed first, the Datapoint 2200 was little-endian. For compatibility, the 8008 was little-endian, and this is still the case in Intel's processors. Another feature of the Datapoint 2200 was the parity flag, since parity calculation was important for a terminal's communication. The parity flag has continued to the x86 architecture. The 8008 is architecturally unrelated to Intel's 4-bit 4004 processor12. The 8008 is not an 8-bit version of the 4-bit 4004 in any way. The similar names are purely a marketing invention; during its design phase the 8008 had the unexciting name "1201". If you want more early microprocessor history, I wrote a detailed article for the IEEE Spectrum. I also wrote a post about TI's TMC 1795. How the 8008 fits into the history of semiconductor technology The 4004 and 8008 both used silicon-gate enhancement-mode PMOS, a semiconductor technology that was only used briefly. This puts the chips at an interesting point in chip fabrication technology. The 8008 (and modern processors) uses MOS transistors. These transistors had a long path to acceptance, being slower and less reliable than the bipolar transistors used in most computers of the 1960s. By the late 1960s, MOS integrated circuits were becoming more common; the standard technology was PMOS transistors with metal gates. The gates of the transistor consisted of metal, which was also used to connect components of the chip. Chips essentially had two layers of functionality: the silicon itself, and the metal wiring on top. This technology was used in many Texas Instruments calculator chips, as well as the TMC 1795 chip (the chip that had the same instruction set as the 8008). A key innovation that made the 8008 practical was the self-aligned gate—a transistor using a gate of polysilicon rather than metal. Although this technology was invented by Fairchild and Bell Labs, it was Intel that pushed the technology ahead. Polysilicon gate transistors had much better performance than metal gate (for complex semiconductor reasons). In addition, adding a polysilicon layer made routing of signals in the chip much easier, making the chips denser. The diagram below shows the benefit of self-aligned gates: the metal-gate TMC 1795 is bigger than the 4004 and 8008 chips combined. Intel's 4004 and 8008 processors are much denser than Texas Instruments' TMC 1795 chip, largely due to their use of self-aligned gates. Shortly afterwards, semiconductor technology improved again with the use of NMOS transistors instead of PMOS transistors. Although PMOS transistors were easier to manufacture initially, NMOS transistors are faster, so once NMOS could be fabricated reliably, they were a clear win. NMOS led to more powerful chips such as the Intel 8080 and the Motorola 6800 (both 1974). Another technology improvement of this time was ion-implantation to change the characteristics of transistors. This allowed the creation of "depletion-mode" transistors for use as pull-up resistors. These transistors improved chip performance and reduced power consumption. They also allowed the creation of chips that ran on standard five-volt supplies.13 The combination of NMOS transistors and depletion-mode pull-ups was used for most of the microprocessors of the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the 6502 (1975), Z-80 (1976), 68000 (1979), and Intel chips from the 8085 (1976) to the 80286 (1982). In the mid 1980s, CMOS took over, using NMOS and PMOS transistors together to dramatically reduce power consumption, with chips such as the 80386 (1986), 68020 (1984) and ARM1 (1985). Now almost all chips are CMOS.14 As you can see, the 1970s were a time of large changes in semiconductor chip technology. The 4004 and 8008 were created when the technological capability intersected with the right market. How to take die photos In this section, I explain how I got the photos of the 8008 die. The first step is to open the chip package to expose the die. Most chips come in epoxy packages, which can be dissolved with dangerous acids. The 8008 microprocessor in a ceramic package Since I would rather avoid boiling nitric acid, I took a simpler approach. The 8008 is also available in a ceramic package (above), which I got on eBay. Tapping the chip along the seam with a chisel pops the two ceramic layers apart. The photo below shows the lower half of the ceramic package, with the die exposed. Most of the metal pins have been removed, but their positions in the package are visible. To the right of the die is a small square; this connects ground (Vcc) to the substrate. A couple of the tiny bond wires are still visible, connected to the die. Inside the package of the 8008 microprocessor, the silicon die is visible. Once the die is exposed, a microscope can be used to take photographs. A standard microscope shines the light from below, which doesn't work well for die photographs. Instead, I used a metallurgical microscope, which shines the light from above to illuminate the chip. I took 48 photographs through the microscope and then used the Hugin stitching software to combine them into one high-resolution image (details). Finally, I adjusted the image contrast to make the chip's structures more visible. The original image (which is approximately what you see through the microscope) is below for comparison. Die photograph of the 8008 microprocessor Conclusion I took detailed die photos of the 8008 that reveal the circuitry it used. While the 8008 wasn't the first microprocessor or even the first 8-bit microprocessor, it was truly revolutionary, triggering the microprocessor revolution and leading to the x86 architecture that dominates personal computers today. In future posts, I plan to explain the 8008's circuits in detail to provide a glimpse into the roots of todays computers. I announce my latest blog posts on Twitter, so follow me at kenshirriff. Or you can use the RSS feed. Notes and references 1. According to the oral history of the 8008, photos of the 8008 were obtained in October / November 1971 (page 6). Chip designer Federico Faggin mentions that toward the end of 1971, "everything was working except for a few errors." Faggin then debugged a problem with the dynamic memory losing data, making it ready for production (page 9). ↩ 2. Using the carry look ahead circuit avoids the delay from a standard ripple-carry adder, where the carries propagate through the sum. ↩ 3. The 8008's ALU supports eight operations: add, subtract, add with carry, subtract with carry, AND, OR, XOR, and compare. It also implements left and right shift and rotate operations. The 8008 also has increment and decrement instructions, extending the Datapoint 2200's instruction set. ↩ 4. Because silicon has higher resistance than polysilicon, most chips use the polysilicon and metal layers for wiring, not the silicon layer. The 4004 and 8008 chips are unusual in that they prefer to use the silicon layer for wiring rather than polysilicon. I expect this was due to the recent introduction of polysilicon: before polysilicon, routing needed to be done in the silicon layer and perhaps the chip designers were sticking with the older layout techniques. ↩ 5. The 8008 required 20 support chips according to chip architect Federico Faggin. In contrast, the 4004 and earlier MOS computers such as the Four Phase and CADC were designed with a small number of MOS chips that worked together without extra "glue chips". In this sense, the 8008 was a step backwards architecturally, saying "here's the CPU, you figure out how to make a computer out of it." ↩ 6. For details on Intel's insistence on 16 pins, see Oral History of Federico Faggin, page 55-56. It was only when the 1103 memory chip required 18 pins that Intel reluctantly moved beyond 16 pins. And that was treated by Intel like "the sky had dropped from heaven," resulting in "so many long faces". ↩ 7. If two metal lines need to cross, one of them can be routed under the other by using the polysilicon layer. To be low resistance, this cross-under must be relatively wide, so cross-unders are avoided if possible. ↩ 8. The 8008 registers use the "3T1C" cell: three transistors and one capacitor (details). The circuit doesn't physically contain a separate capacitor, but uses the gate capacitance of the transistor. One unusual feature of the 8008 cell is it uses one wire for both reading and writing the bit, while the typical 3T cell has separate wires for reading and writing. The 4004 had separate wires, but the design changed slightly in the 8008. ↩ 9. Pull-up resistors in later chips such as the 6502 were implemented using depletion-mode NMOS transistors. These yielded more faster, more efficient logic. They were also wired differently, with the gate connected to the output rather than the power rail. ↩ 10. The 8008 architecture and the evolution of Intel's microprocessors are discussed in detail in Intel Microprocessors: 8008 to 8086. ↩ 11. The second version of the Datapoint 2200 had a totally new implementation of the processor, still built from TTL chips. While the first version had a serial ALU (processing one bit at a time), the second version operated in parallel using 74181 ALU chips. As a result, the second version was much faster. ↩ 12. The extensive 4004 Anniversary Project has reverse-engineered the 4004 processor. The 4004 schematic is here. ↩ 13. The Motorola 6800 microprocessor originally used enhancement-mode transistors. To operate off a single +5V supply, it had a voltage-doubler circuit on the chip. ↩ 14. Interestingly, in 2007 Intel started using metal gates again in order to scale transistors further (details). In a way, semiconductor technology has gone full circle, back to metal gates, although now unusual metals such as hafnium are used. ↩ No comments yet 31 interactions Share this article: Add New Comment You need to be a member to leave a comment.

Image courtesy of Sprint Sprint unveils open source NFV/SDN reference solution dubbed C3PO 0 By Sean Kinney on May 16, 2017 Carriers, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software-defined networks (SDN) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Developed with Intel Labs, Sprint says C3PO combines open source software with off-the-shelf hardware to drive network efficiencies The ever-increasing complexity of evolving telecommunications networks is forcing operators to quickly virtualize and automate network management and operational processes to keep up with the flexibility and scale demanded by consumers. The push to network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) has prompted a shift away from proprietary equipment and software control to the use of open source software and less expensive, off-the-shelf data center hardware. One of the most visible examples is AT&T’s ECOMP, which was recently joined with Huawei’s Open-O into the Linux Foundation-managed ONAP. Now, Sprint, in partnership with Intel Labs, has entered the mix with C3PO. Let’s unpack this acronym within an acronym. C3PO stands for Clean CUPS Core for Packet Optimization. CUPS stands for Control and User Plane Separation. While it’s not clear if Sprint’s C3PO is “fluent in over six million forms of communication,” the new reference, contributed to OpenDaylight, covers seven network functions Sprint described as “applicable to essentially all user traffic.” Those are: Serving gateway Packet gateway Deep packet inspection Child protection filtering Carrier-grade network address translation (NAT) Static firewall Service function chaining classification (ISC) Sprint VP of Technology Ron Marquardt described the impetus for C3PO in a company blog post: “Over the past few years while preparing to move from proprietary hardware to virtualized solutions, it became increasingly important for us to understand how to best optimize our network applications for provisioning on an Intel processor-based server.  When our work with Intel Labs developing C3PO first began, CUPS was just a nascent concept, and the industry work being done on NFV was still theoretical.  For simplicity, the latter was often depicted as individual software elements conceptually interconnected in a manner that would require significant compute overhead.  NFV and SDN were both defined in their own contexts, with little attempt yet to marry these concepts in a performance-optimized manner.  It was the early days of the industry’s march to virtual implementations.” Now, Marquardt said the carrier is working to harden C3PO and expand into new use cases, particularly the internet of things. “As operators scale IoT, low-cost solutions will be vital to drive viable economics when connected devices grow to 10s and 200s of billions in number. We believe a commercial version of C3PO to be a potential solution well-targeted for low-cost, large-scale applications such as this.” He also said Sprint will use information from 3GPP and IETF to help develop 5G compatibility. Sprint has been working on this project with Intel for four years.

Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. -- Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. -- Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. -- The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. -- Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. Basel, May 17, 2017 - On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.[1] The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners - from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners - to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. "To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people's quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided," said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. "Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce" said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative's global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. "Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability." Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. "The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there," said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. "We're excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality." Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country's population, around 1.4 million people.[2] In this capital city, also one of the world's most polluted cities,[3] more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension[4] and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.[5] Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,[6] and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application. In 2016, the operational budget for the Foundation was CHF 15 million and our programs reached 8.9 million people.

Ronen Zvulun / Reuters Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly Opinion Israel, the Driverless Nation Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli startups In an unprecedented move, the tax windfall Israel expects to reap from Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of the self-driving-car company Mobileye will be paid in dollars rather than shekels under an agreement with the U.S. semiconductor giant announced Tuesday. The Bank of Israel is loath to have Intel convert the tax money into shekels – a figure that experts predict between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. The central bank has been fighting a mostly losing battle to stem an appreciating shekel for fear it will make Israeli exports uncompetitive and hurt economic growth. It has acquired some $4 billion in foreign currency this year and doesn’t want Intel undoing all that work by buying hundreds of millions of dollars in shekels to pay its tax bill. The agreement to pay the tax bill in greenbacks was reached between Intel and the Israel Tax Authority, the Finance Ministry accountant general and the Bank of Israel. “This is a historic event. The decision means the treasury, even if it’s not saying so officially, has decided to intervene in the forex market,” said Yossi Fraiman, CEO of Prico Risk Management & Investments. “The treasury is doing this intervention through the Tax Authority, and we can assume it will be making deals like this going forward.” Keep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email* Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close The treasury has basically intervened in the forex market before through hedging deals, but this time it is acting far more decisively, Fraiman said. “The Finance Ministry understands that the Bank of Israel can’t act alone and that a shekel appreciation would be fatal for domestic industry, not just the export sector, because it would also mean cheaper imports and competition for factories that employ the weakest segments of the labor market,” he said. Actually, the shekel’s strengthening hasn’t done much this year to worsen Israel’s trade picture. The Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday exports of goods and services climbed at a preliminary 8% annual rate in the first quarter while imports were down 8.9%. The dollar fell below 3.60 shekels twice in the last two days, but it turned higher and its Bank of Israel rate was 3.6060 on Tuesday. Intel’s March announcement that it was buying Mobileye was celebrated in Israel. If approved by Intel shareholders next month, as expected, it will be the biggest purchase of an Israeli company ever − one that has been lauded as yet another seal of approval from a leading global tech company of Israel’s high-tech prowess. Also, the proceeds will help fill the government’s already overstuffed coffers and were reportedly a factor in Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon’s decision to unveil a series of tax cuts and other help for young working families. Now that the government will be receiving the Intel taxes in dollars, the proceeds will either be deposited at the Bank of Israel as foreign exchange reserves or spent abroad by Israel on arms or other items. As the buyer of Mobileye, Intel itself doesn’t owe any taxes – it’s the sellers that are liable. But under the acquisition terms, the U.S. company will assess their tax liability, pay it and transfer the net amount owed to Mobileye shareholders.

Intel’s deal with Nvidia ended on March 17, 2017. The two companies apparently disagreed over licensing the nForce chipset—a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia—which resulted in a $1.5 billion settlement that Intel agreed to pay for five years, said Fudzilla. While the report was short on detail, Fudzilla did say that the agreement will now allow Intel to access AMD’s graphics Intellectual Properties, as well as most things dealing with AMD’s Radeon technology. It is still unclear, however, when the deal will be formally announced. Over the past year, AMD has gained over 211%, and this deal with Intel will likely boost its value even more. AMD is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘C.’ Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

That answer is essentially a single massive pool of memory, with a single address space. A prototype version of The Machine the company introduced Tuesday has 160 terabytes of memory across 40 physical nodes interconnected by a high-performance fabric. Importantly, The Machine is not powered by Intel processors, which dominate the data center and high-performance computing market, but by an ARM System-on-Chip designed by Cavium. While nobody can predict the future of computing, Intel’s role in HPE’s version of that future appears to be a lot smaller than it is today. The core idea behind HPE’s new architecture – “the largest R&D program in the history of the company” – is replacing focus on the processor with focus on memory. From the press release: “By eliminating the inefficiencies of how memory, storage and processors interact in traditional systems today, Memory-Driven Computing reduces the time needed to process complex problems from days to hours, hours to minutes, minutes to seconds – to deliver real-time intelligence.” The philosophy is similar to the one behind in-memory computing systems for Oracle or SAP HANA databases. Holding all the data in memory theoretically makes computing faster because data doesn’t have to be shuffled between storage and memory. This means one of the biggest engineering challenges in creating these systems is designing the fabric that interconnects CPUs to memory in a way that avoids bottlenecks. It’s a similar challenge to the one that faces engineers who work on another answer to the reportedly looming disconnect between data volume and processing muscle: offloading big processing jobs from the CPU to a big pool of GPUs. The Machine prototype uses photonics to interconnect components. HPE expects the size of shared memory to scale in the future “to a nearly limitless pool of memory – 4,096 yottabytes,” which is 250,000 times the size of all digital data that exists today, according to the company: “With that amount of memory, it will be possible to simultaneously work with every digital health record of every person on earth; every piece of data from Facebook; every trip of Google’s autonomous vehicles; and every data set from space exploration all at the same time.” Previous Article NVIDIA CEO: AI Workloads Will “Flood” Data Centers Next Article Microsoft Faulted Over Ransomware While Shifting Blame to NSA Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

That rumor is now reaffirmed and getting stronger. It might just be a cross-license agreement so that Intel will be enabled to use some of AMD patents. It also might be that AMD could fab the IGP that is to be paired with Intel CPU dies. According to Fudzilla both companies have finalized the deal. In the end we do not see that last part happening, but Intel is hungry for a GPU patent license, and we all know that AMD can use some additional positive cash-flow. So at this stage, it does not seem unlikely anymore. To date, neither company has confirmed any of this. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Truth be told though we have not seen a new APU in years. If Summit Ridge rumors are true, then we will see some good performance coming out of their igpu's soon enough. But even if the hardware is capable Intel compared to AMD, drivers for IGPU on the Intel side are horrible. 2 pages 1 2 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

The BMW Group, Intel Corporation and Mobileye N.V. announced Tuesday their intention to onboard Delphi as a development partner and system integrator for their state-of-the-art autonomous driving platform. While Delphi, headquartered in Gillingham, Kent, United Kingdom, issued a short news release about the move, the other three companies, which joined force in July 2016 to deliver a fully automated driving system for serial production by 2021, released a more detailed statement. As one of the world's largest automotive parts manufacturers, "Delphi has already provided a prototype compute platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion and high performance automated driving computing," according to the statement. BMW, headquartered in Munich, Germany, is the world's leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles with one of four brand names, namely BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Intel Corporation, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the United States, is the world's leading integrated circuit chipmaker. Mobileye N.V., headquartered in Jerusalem, is a leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver-assistance systems. These three companies, as Cooperation Partners, claimed they have developed "a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state-of-the-art designs and create differentiated brands." System integrators, such as Delphi, are critical for the go-to-market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly, they said in the statement. And "a key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures." In addition, they expected that Delphi might provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. "The partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye continues to break new ground in the auto industry," said Intel Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich. "In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving... Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers." Krzanich said the alliance is "on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year." In his statement, Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Delphi, said his company's "close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success." Noting that the engagement between Delphi and the Cooperation Partners is "non-exclusive," BMW, Intel and Mobileye noted they are "in the process of onboarding additional integration and development partners to support future OEM customer needs." OEM, short for original equipment manufacturer, refers in the auto industry to the manufacturer of the parts assembled during the construction of a new vehicle.

Prepping MacBook Updates for WWDC Three of Apple's portable Mac products are reportedly getting upgrades next month. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 16, 2017 at 7:30PM Per a fresh report from Bloomberg, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "plans to announce an update to its laptop lineup at an annual conference for app developers in early June." Or, in other words, at Apple's World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC). Image source: Apple. Bloomberg says that the Mac maker plans to refresh three of its MacBook products. The company's MacBook Pro "will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel" (NASDAQ:INTC), and its 12-inch MacBook will also get a "faster Intel chip." Perhaps most interestingly, Bloomberg says that Apple "has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor" because sales of the device "remain surprisingly strong." The MacBook Pro updates Apple currently sells its MacBook Pro computers in two screen sizes -- 13 inches and 15 inches. Both current models incorporate Intel's Skylake processor family (marketed as sixth-generation Core), and both lack features available in Kaby Lake chips (marketed as seventh-generation Core), and are less efficient, to boot. Image source: Intel. The move from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core isn't going to deliver a groundbreaking improvement in user experience, but higher performance, more features, and better power efficiency are always good things -- especially since Apple's competitors are already shipping systems based on those superior chips. The MacBook update The current 12-inch MacBook also includes a sixth-generation Core processor (though technically the chips are marketed under the now mostly phased-out "Core m" branding, they are sixth-generation Core processors in terms of design and capabilities). I suspect that the "faster Intel chip" that Bloomberg mentions is simply a seventh-generation Core (Kaby Lake) processor. The chips found in the current 12-inch MacBook are quite a bit zippier than the chips used in the first iteration of the 12-inch MacBook, but substantially faster chips (and the Kaby Lake chips suitable for the 12-inch MacBook are noticeably faster than the current Skylake ones) would probably significantly improve the user experience, given the very tight power constraints on the chips inside such slim/fan-less devices. One more thing... Apple's current 13-inch MacBook Air includes a fifth-generation Intel Core processor (based on the Broadwell architecture), which means that in terms of the processor inside of it, it is woefully out of date. Intel delivered substantial performance/feature improvements in moving from its fifth-generation Core product line to its sixth-generation Core products, and it did so again when it moved from its sixth-generation Core to its seventh-generation Core products. A two-generation improvement in performance/efficiency should be quite a nice shot in the arm for the 13-inch MacBook Air. The Bloomberg article didn't make clear what other enhancements, if any, Apple plans to bring to the faster 13-inch MacBook Air, but here are two features that could help make the device more competitive in the marketplace: Better display: The display found on the current 13-inch MacBook Air is simply not acceptable for anything close to resembling a premium laptop. An upgrade to a higher-resolution, IPS display (though support for wide color isn't necessary) would be most welcome for this product. More modern look: The current 13-inch MacBook Air is based on an ancient (in tech terms) design, with the most prominent sign of this being the huge bezels around the display. These bezels need to be shrunken, at a minimum. If the current 13-inch MacBook Air is still selling reasonably well given all of its deficits, then one with new processors and the changes outlined above could do really well in the marketplace, potentially enabling Apple to accelerate share gains against Windows-based notebooks.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | May 16, 2017 4:10 PM PT Credit: AMD More like this Ryzen review: AMD is back AMD's Ryzen launches March 2, outperforming Intel's Core i7 at a fraction of... AMD teases Ryzen 5, Zen 2 plans as it begins shipping its first Ryzen 7 chips Video Surface Pro 4 vs. Surface Book: How to decide It's called Threadripper, and it will be the first consumer-focused chip with 16 cores and 32 threads of computing power. Yes, you read that right: 16 cores and 32 threads of computing power, confirming that the CPU wars will rage on at the high end. AMD's Jim Anderson announced the high-end desktop chip during the company's financial analyst day Tuesday. Details were sparse, but the CPU has been making the rumor mills the last few weeks, though the company was expecting to announce at the upcoming Computex show. But AMD couldn't wait. One reason may be heavy and hot rumors that Intel is preparing to release a Core i9 CPU at Computex. If the rumors are true, Intel's top-end Core i9 will feature 12 cores and Hyper-Threading, and will be paired with a new X299 chipset. The CPUs themselves would apparently be based on 6th-generation Skylake cores. Why this matters: Grab your popcorn, because after years of Intel domination, the CPU wars are on—and that's great news for PC enthusiasts. If previous Ryzen chip performance is a predictor of how Threadripper will do, the 32-thread chip should easily surpass Intel's current 10-core Core i7-6950X in heavily multi-threaded and heavy multi-tasking chores. "Ryzen Threadripper is targeted at the absolute ultra high-end of performance in desktop," Anderson said. So how far can AMD and Intel go pushing thread-count as a feature? Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights said the sky is the limit. "Both companies can push the core count as far as they keep adding value without taking away from the rest of the experience, things like power. 32 threads still adds value to high quality video editing, transcoding and gaming while streaming and voice chat." While Intel could have issues with its rumored new CPUs eating into sales of Xeons but there are enough differences, Moorhead said. "There will be some cannibalism for sure, especially when both high thread parts use a server socket," Moorhead said. "But that is mitigated when that same desktop socket has lower memory bandwidth. AMD has 0 percent upside so there isn't any cannibalism today." IDG AMD's Threadripper is due the summer of 2017 and will feature 16-cores and 32-threads of compute power. Unanswered questions With Intel's rumored Core i9 expected to max out with 12 cores, AMD's 16-core Threadripper could very well steal its thunder. Assuming the clock speeds of Threadripper are comparable to those of the rumored Core i9, cores generally trump clock speeds on multi-threaded tasks. Of course, none of this is real until the chips are shipped and in the hands of independent reviewers.  One problem both Intel and AMD face, though, is finding consumer workloads that can stress 12 or 16 cores. The crowd that buys this class of hardware typically doesn't buy it for practical use, but rather for the performance. That brings us to the most important question, for which no one yet has the answer. There have been many leaks on the chips and even how many PCIe lanes they have (44 for both top-end chips), but one thing no one has even tried to guess is just how much Intel and AMD will charge for these behemoths. Intel's current 10-core Core i7-6950X was introduced at an astounding $1,723 when it first came out. But that was before Ryzen, and clearly Intel has serious competition again from AMD. Thus far Intel has resisted slashing prices to compete with Ryzen, but many expect that to change this summer when its next-gen chips are introduced. "Threadripper could garner over a $1,000 price point, but it will depend how much volume AMD wants to drive," Moorhead said.

The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) is the largest international science competition for pre-college students. Ashish S, KM Udith Raju and P Kiran Kumar  Reddy of class X participated in the innovation challenge at Osmania University Hyderabad, where they came up with the project. As many as 256 schools participated in the competition from across the country from which as the projects of the three students were selected.   Students of two other schools from the country, the Amity International School, Delhi and Rainbow International School, Himachal Pradesh have been selected for the same. Renu Singh, principal, Air Force School, Hebbal, says. “The boys left on May 13 and will be back on May 22. They have been selected as ‘observers; at the fair. From what I understand they will get an an opportunity to participate in the science fair and will also get a chance to to interact with local scientific community of students and educator. It is a sort of an educational tour that will surely do the boys great good.” The students have regularly participated in many innovation challenges. They won the Teenovators innovation challenge in 2015-16. It is a pan-India national level competition for students between class 9 to 12 organised by Manipal University. They won this challenge for their ideas on using robotic models for prosthetic limbs and another idea of using robotic device to do the manual labour of human beings. The three boys have also done the school proud by helping it get grants under the The ‘Atal Innovation Mission’ (AIM), a central government scheme to foster  creativity among students. It aims to establish ‘Atal Tinkering Laboratories’ (ATLs) in schools across India as a work space where young minds can give shape to their ideas. Air Force School Hebbal, Bengaluru has been selected for setting up ‘Atal Tinkering Laboratories’. The school is one among 257 schools selected, out of a total of 13,000 schools.

Photographer: Jim Wilson/The New York Times Apple Inc. plans to announce an update to its laptop lineup at an annual conference for app developers in early June, a move that could help offset new competition from Microsoft Corp. as well as declining iPad sales. Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company's $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple's resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft's first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac's recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it's ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer's low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn't mark a major step forward for Apple's notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company's dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple's desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Apple hasn't announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year's conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. With assistance from Ian King.

Crowds of people walking around in team colours, fans in the stands screaming. The noise was deafening and the excitement was contagious. I can honestly say I have never been to a sports event quite like this. At the start of day one I knew nothing about eSports, about IEM, or about Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. By the end of day two I was cheering for SK Gaming over FaZe Clan and even understood what “banana” was. This isn’t some flash in the pan phenomenon. The prize money for first place alone was $100,000. We weren’t given exact attendance figures but I was told there were roughly 10,000 people in the stadium on the second day (with roughly 7000 on day one). One thing that was constantly made clear to me was that this is a legitimate sport. At the opening press conference with ESL Global’s Ralf Reichert, Intel’s Frank Soqui (GM of VR & Gaming Group) and George Woo (eSports Marketing Manager), all three speakers made the point. These are real sports. Science has quantified it, they said, by studying the heart rates and endorphin levels of eSport athletes against traditional athletes. The online viewership numbers, in the hundreds of millions they said, validate eSports. The hours and hours of practice, the dedication, the money, the potential that eSports may be part of the 2022 Asian games, all of it combines, they said, to make this a real sport. Maybe it does. I mean honestly we’re living in a world where golf is considered a sport, so why not? But even with all of the money and fans this sport has a long way to go. The crowd at the Qudos arena in Sydney were raucous and having a great time. They were, however, a homogenous crowd. White men between the ages of 18 to 25, many drinking heavily. On the second day alone I counted five shoeys (where you pour a beer into your shoe and then drink from it). The cameras never pulled away, the crowd brayed for more. Based on my previous experience covering sports events, they weren’t as bad as cricket fans but worse than football fans. #YeahTheBoys#IEM pic.twitter.com/5ZDhidzgVJ — ESL Counter-Strike (@ESLCS) May 6, 2017 Every major sport has fan issues, but eSports is still growing and it’s difficult to grow a fanbase when a chunk may not want to come to live events. Especially when the MCs would also make casual “edgy” jokes, lowering themselves to the level of drive time radio DJs. Of course live events are for the spectacle; online is where the big money is. Distribution of IEM is, like other eSports tournaments, available on multiple free platforms. Partners like Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook enable easy growth and, as Ralf noted, “we don’t want [IEM] behind a wall”. All of this skirts around the question of inclusion. More fans means more people wanting to compete, but looking through the teams competing in IEM Sydney you saw the a mirror image of the crowd: white men aged between 18 and 25. The question on diversity was put to Frank Soqui in an odd fashion: “Do you see a time when women’s teams will compete against men?” The answer was perfect though: “Why wouldn’t we have mixed teams? It’s not like men and women are any different.” Sadly though that goal is a long way off. When I asked how far away those mixed teams might be the answer was 20 years. “eSports moves faster than other sports. We see other sports, like football, finally embracing the women’s side, but after maybe 30 or so years”, Ralf admitted, “So it might be 15 or 20 years away.” Considering that by age 20 most players are about to reach retirement, so the first women who will compete in a truly mixed competition haven’t been born yet. And it’s a shame because this sport is exciting and more people should be into it. I mean, it only took me 24 hours to get totally hooked. Soqui and George Woo said they wanted IEM to have the same kind of sports moments that you associate with the Superbowl or Australian Open. I’m not sure if this tournament offered that but there were some cool plays, at least one 5 kill, and a chance for a “that’s not a knife, this is a knife” joke.

FaZe wasn’t going down easy though. They clawed back a close 13-16 round on the Nuke map to make the score 2-1 in the best of five series. It was clear that the crowd was behind FaZe, the self described “band of rejects” and one of the few player-owned teams. But there were no boos or jeering of the eventual winners SK Gaming (a large tick in the “positive” column for the fans). It was a grand celebration. Later in the press room the winners finally emerged, looking exhausted and carrying the over-sized plate which was the trophy. Sydney’s first ever IEM championship team were then split by media managers and asked a series of sports-cliches by waiting game journalists. No panel press conference in front of a wall of sponsor logos. As we waited I chatted to some of the other journos, from both sides of the Tasman. Could we have something like IEM in New Zealand? Who will create New Zealand’s first fully pro team to enter? As a small country can we get more young women involved earlier? How do we get past the fact that we are really quite far away from everyone else? Needless to say we had all the questions and none of the solutions. But there is an inevitable rising tide, and eSports is like a tsunami.

I saw the topic discussed on a podcast and the question was How much further could we have progressed if we never called it esports? Imagine if we all called it competitive gaming, the trade off being it's not as catchy but then we would never have had any opposition from regular sports fans. interesting to ponder...   Reply       By: Hadyn Green Published: Wednesday 17 May 2017 11:00 AM Related Games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive FollowOwn it?     Ad FeedbackAdvertisement Latest Articles Intel Extreme Masters Sydney Wednesday 17 May 11:00am | 4 Dragon Quest Heroes II Review Tuesday 16 May 11:00am | 5 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Review Monday 15 May 11:00am | 6 Games and Our Behaviour Friday 12 May 1:00pm | 7 Win LocoRoco Remastered on PS4!

People familiar with the matter have revealed that the firm is set to release three new laptops at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose in June. The sources told Bloomberg that Apple the MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip and the 13-inch MacBook Air will be revamped with a new processor. Scroll down for video  The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip and the 13-inch MacBook Air will be revamped with a new processor (stock) NEW MACBOOKS?  Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple will unveil three new laptops at its annual  Worldwide Developers Conference set to kick off in June. It is believed that the MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip and the 13-inch MacBook Air will be revamped with a new processor. The move is also to retaliate against Microsoft’s latest laptop that was released this month - called Surface Laptop. Apple’s MacBooks make up about 11 percent of the firm’s $216 billion annual revenue and because these device have remained surprisingly strong in the market, it seems the firm wants to make them even more attractive. And the move is also to retaliate against Microsoft’s latest laptop that was released this month. Called the Surface Laptop, the device boasts a touch screen, 14.5 hours of battery and boots in a second of being turned on. However, an update to the MacBook Pros could give Apple the momentum it needs to surpass the competition – as it has been one of the top go-to laptops this year. The anonymous sources told Bloomberg that Apple will unveil the new models at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which starts June 5. iOS fans are said to look for the upgraded MacBook Pro with a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp.

In addition to three new MacBooks, Apple is also set to release a 10.5-inch iPad Pro at the June conference, alongside a Siri-powered smart speaker that will take on Amazon's Echo.   The move is also to retaliate against Microsoft’s latest laptop that was released this month. However, an update to the MacBook Pros could give Apple the momentum it needs to surpass the competition – as it has been one of the top go-to laptops this year (stock) KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared the last predictions with 9to5Mac, in which he said there is more than 50 percent chance the smart speaker will be unveiled at the conference and more than 70 percent chance the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will also make an appearance. Kuo described the iPad as 'an all-new design', as it will have the same chassis size as the 9.7-inch model, but will boast a larger screen. It is believed that the device will mirror the design of Apple's upcoming iPhone 8. And Kuo speculates that Apple will ship about six million 10.5-inch iPad Pros this year. APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed that Apple is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker that will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.  In addition to three new MacBooks, Apple is also set to release a 10.5-inch iPad Pro at the June conference, alongside a Siri-powered smart speaker that will take on Amazon's Echo  He also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also revealed that the device will have a 'touch panel', but it is not clear whether this means it will boast capacitive buttons or the design of Amazon's new Echo Show. But what has many iOS fans sitting on the edge of the seats is the possibility of a Siri Speaker. Rumors regarding the smart speaker hit the web in September 2016, when news spread that the device had left the research and development lab and was being tested as a prototype. Although this technology would put the iPhone maker in the same game as Amazon and Google, Apple envisions it a little different - it would augment its smartphones. Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from the other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in September. Sonny Dickson, a well-known tech leaker, revealed that the Cupertino company was 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker and noted that it will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another said.  The public did not hear about the device again until April when Sonny Dickson, a well-known tech leaker, revealed that the Cupertino company was 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker and noted that it will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Not only did he mention that the device is near completion, but he also shared details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. It could also 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. The device could also be designed with capacitive buttons or a touch screen  And earlier this month, Kuo said that the Apple will unveil the Siri speaker at WWDC. The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Appl'e AI into the home, and will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 for the Echo Dot.  Kuo has also noted that the device will have a 'touch panel', but it is not clear whether this means it will boast capacitive buttons or the design of Amazon's new Echo Show.     Read more: KGI: Apple likely to launch 10.5-inch iPad Pro and Siri Speaker at WWDC alongside new software | 9to5Mac Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Apple Plans Laptop Upgrades to Take on Microsoft - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 15 shares Most watched News videos Shocking video of busy road almost set ABLAZE by lightning strike Hilarious moment Saudi man makes enormous blunder doing the dab Deer crashes into family's home and refuses to leave Tiny Pug puppy tries desperately and fails to climb stairs Artist projects protest slogans on Trump International Hotel in DC Foul-mouthed woman goes berserk inside Sprint store Female security guard viciously punched by man in Chicago First Marine Corps recruitment ad with female fighters That's fishy: Trevally attack food during feeding frenzy Gut-wrenching moment a leech is pulled from a woman's nose Passenger has pizza delivered to stalled Amtrak train Driver miraculously survives after head-on crash splits car in half That was fast!

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe.

Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS AMD sets June launch for Zen-based Naples server chips Dean Takahashi@deantak May 16, 2017 4:00 PM Above: Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, introduces Zen. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Advanced Micro Devices announced a timetable for its Zen-based Naples server chips that are aimed at disrupting Intel’s hold on the data center. The new chips will formally launch under the brand name Epyc in June. AMD’s Zen architecture is the company’s most competitive design for a family of new processors in a decade. It launched its Ryzen desktop computer chips in March, saying that the chips could process 52 percent faster per clock cycle than the previous generation. That was a big advance that AMD says carries over to Naples. Naples is a two-socket server chip aimed at Intel’s flagship chip, the Broadwell-EP-based Xeon E5 V4. Naples has 32 cores and is capable of processing 64 simultaneous threads at the same time. It supports up to two terabytes of RAM, while Broadwell chips have 22 cores, 44 threads, and 1.5 TB of RAM. AMD previously said it was shipping the Naples chips in the second quarter, and now it has narrowed that window to a matter of weeks. AMD is emphasizing its high core count, big memory bandwidth, and support for high-speed input/output channels in a single chip. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, said during the company’s financial analyst day that Epyc promises to revolutionize the dual-socket server market while simultaneously reshaping expectations for single-socket servers. The first Epyc-based servers will launch in June with widespread support from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and channel partners, AMD said. “With the new Epyc processor, AMD takes the next step on our journey in high-performance computing,” said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager of enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom products at AMD. “AMD Epyc processors will set a new standard for two-socket performance and scalability. As we demonstrated today, we see further opportunity with the industry’s first no-compromise one-socket solutions. We believe that this new product line-up has the potential to reshape significant portions of the data center market with its unique combination of performance, design flexibility, and disruptive total cost of ownership (TCO).” AMD showed a single Epyc processor exceeding the performance of a competitive mid-range, two-socket / two-processor platform in a head-to-head comparison. AMD said that Epyc has 45 percent more cores, 60 percent more input-output capacity, and 122 percent more memory bandwidth than its nearest rival. “Dropbox is currently evaluating AMD Epyc CPUs in-house, and we are impressed with the initial performance we see across workloads in single-socket configurations,” said Akhil Gupta, vice president of infrastructure at Dropbox, in a statement. “The combination of core performance, memory bandwidth, and I/O support make Epyc a unique offering. We look forward to continuing to evaluate Epyc as an option for our infrastructure.” “Today’s single-socket server offerings push buyers toward purchasing a more expensive two-socket server just to get the memory bandwidth and I/O they need to support the compute performance of the cores,” said Matthew Eastwood, senior vice president at IDC, in a statement. “There are no fully featured, high-performance server processors available today in a single-socket configuration. Epyc changes that dynamic by offering a single-processor solution that delivers the right-sized number of high-performance cores, memory, and I/O for today’s workloads.” VB Recommendations Facebook’s fact checking may help spread fake news 5 bots to try this week: Spider-Man, Discord Dungeons, Beam, Pizza Bottle, and Kim Kardashian Final Fantasy IX PC mod adds high-def background art

Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company is reportedly also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong. Apple and Intel declined to comment. Latest business videos The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries — the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The move comes after Microsoft has released its Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch-screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. But Apple’s updates could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the same quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. It’s not known whether Apple’s new in-house chip, which manages the computer’s low-power mode, will be ready for this generation. The planned upgrades are not a major step forward, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has drawn recent criticism. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger track pad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, and the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it released the Mac Pro desktop model and updated the MacBook Air. This year, it is expected to also announce a new version of MacOS. Apple typically releases the Mac software upgrades in the fall. Mark Gurman and Alex Webb are Bloomberg writers.

Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The Mac lineup generates just 11 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s $216 billion in annual sales, with the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Delphi Automotive Is Joining BMW's Self-Driving Car Effort The tech-savvy supplier will help BMW and its other partners integrate a self-driving system -- and offer it to other automakers. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) May 16, 2017 at 6:05PM Tech-savvy auto-industry supplier Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH) is joining BMW's (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) self-driving car effort. Delphi will join BMW's existing partners, Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), in an effort to create fully autonomous technology for BMW's future vehicles, the companies announced on Tuesday. Delphi will help integrate the system into BMW's vehicles -- as well as offer it for sale to other automakers.  Delphi is joining an existing self-driving development partnership between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, BMW CEO Harald Krueger, and Mobileye chairman and CTO Amnon Shashua announced the formation of the partnership at an event last July. Image source: BMW AG. What the companies said Delphi is joining an effort that has been ongoing for about a year now. Last July, BMW, Mobileye, and Intel announced that they had joined forces to help BMW bring a fully autonomous vehicle platform to market by 2021.  BMW said in a statement on Tuesday that, together with Mobileye and Intel, it has developed a "scalable [self-driving] architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue State-of-the-Art designs and create differentiated brands." Delphi's role, BMW said, will be to help bring a series of self-driving systems to market -- and to offer them to other automakers: System integrators, such as Delphi, are critical for the go to market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly. A key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures. Additionally, Delphi may also provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. ["OEM" is auto-industry slang for companies that build finished vehicles -- "Original Equipment Manufacturers" -- as opposed to suppliers like Delphi.] BMW said that the systems that will be brought to market by the partners range from "Level 3" to full "Level 5" systems. (You can learn more about the levels of self-driving technology here.)  Why Delphi was chosen to help bring this new system to market Delphi is a natural fit for this effort. It's already working with Mobileye and Intel in a separate effort, announced in August of last year, to offer a "turnkey" Level 4 self-driving system to automakers by the end of 2019. In a post on Delphi's corporate blog, CTO Glen De Vos said that effort will continue: This agreement [with BMW] won't slow down our previously announced automated driving solution called the Centralized Sensing, Localization and Planning Platform (CSLP), which Delphi, Mobileye and Intel are developing -- a turnkey AD solution based on the Ottomatika software, our computing platform, and our sensors. In fact, one of the most exciting aspects of today's announcement is the potential to align our work on the CSLP Platform with the work BMW, Intel, and Mobileye are doing as part of their cooperation. What it means for Delphi investors Earlier this month, Delphi announced that it will spin off its legacy powertrain systems business into a separate company, while it refocuses its core business on higher-profit electrical and electronic segments. Put another way, Delphi is aiming to reposition itself as a pure play focused on driverless vehicle technology.  While it's no surprise that Intel and Mobileye would want to work with their existing partner, this deal with BMW and the others helps bolster Delphi's position as an emerging leader in the integration of self-driving systems.  While that might not do wonders for Delphi's stock price in the near term, it will provide another proof point of Delphi's market position in this important emerging space over time.  John Rosevear has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities previously predicted Kaby Lake-based MacBook Pro upgrades this year with a possible 32GB RAM option. Apple last refreshed the MacBook Pro with a new design and Thunderbolt 3 I/O back in the fall, although feedback from professional users could warrant a quick turnaround for the more capable machines. Apple’s 12-inch MacBook was first introduced two years ago and updated to a faster Core M processor a year later which happens to be just over a year ago. Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air remains available for sale but new configurations have not been released recently. Instead, Apple pitched the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar as the modern MacBook Air despite still offering the thinner machine at a lower price. Apple has already publicly stated that new iMacs are coming later this year and a new modular Mac Pro and Apple-branded display are coming in the future. In addition to the newly reported notebooks expected at WWDC now, various reports have claimed Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro that has been rumored for a while and even the rumored Siri Speaker could be introduced at the keynote. Apple will also likely show off iOS 11, macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and tvOS 11 as the focus of the keynote. Apple’s WWDC keynote kicks off on June 5 at 10 am PT where 9to5Mac will bring full coverage from San Jose, CA so stay tuned for more. Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more MacBook Pro news!

Prep’s Science Research Program has been very successful, with 13 of the last 18 years resulting in Intel Science Talent Search semi-finalists.  According to their website, “The Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS), a program of Society for Science & the Public (SSP) is the nation’s most prestigious science research competition for high school seniors.  Since 1942, first in partnership with Westinghouse and since 1998 with Intel, SSP has provided a national stage for the country’s best and brightest young scientists to present original research to nationally recognized professional scientists.” According to James Boylan, the program’s director, the students in Prep’s Science Research Program are some of the most highly motivated and involved in the school.  While they excel at science, Boylan points out that many don’t pursue it as a career or course of study, but take the discipline and lessons learned with them into their collegiate and professional lives.  In addition to Boylan, a graduate of Iona College and Fordham University, the program is also administered by Casey Clark, graduate of New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. St. Francis Prep’s Science Research Symposium will be held Thursday, June 1 at 6:00 p.m., beginning in the school’s cafeteria.  Senior Presentations will begin at 7:00 p.m., with awards at 8:00 p.m.  Admission is free, and there will be light refreshments.  St. Francis Prep is located at 6100 Francis Lewis Boulevard in Fresh Meadows.              2017-05-17 / Front Page Bill Addresses Illegal Conversions And Neglect In Buildings Back to index Legally Blind Queens Village Resident Receives I Make It Happen Award Return to top Loading ...

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation: The Bear Case From a Bull The semiconductor giant is neither flawless nor risk-free. And that's coming from a longtime shareholder. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) May 16, 2017 at 5:00PM I have been an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shareholder since 2012. The semiconductor giant has treated me well. My original position has more than doubled (including the returns on nearly five years of reinvested dividends), and the effective dividend yield on those original shares stands at 5.5% today. So I clearly qualify as an Intel bull. But mighty Intel is not immune to business risks, and even long-term investors have to hit the "sell" button once in a while. What could Intel be doing better these days, and what would it take to make me an ex-shareholder? Image source: Intel. Intel's errors Last month, Intel announced a $15 billion buyout in the mobile technology space. Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) is an established leader in its chosen field, and Intel can be forgiven for wanting to grab a high-quality entry ramp into the self-driving car space. But Intel has a disturbing tendency to pull the trigger on some highly questionable deals. For example, the $7.7 billion acquisition of data security expert McAfee was supposed to kick-start Intel's own security efforts. Instead, the same operation was sold off to private investors last year, and that price tag was nearly 50% smaller. Mobileye could very well become another cash-burning experiment, and perhaps a very expensive one. Right now, Intel is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. The company recently disclosed a security flaw in business-class chipsets released in the last decade. Chip features intended to improve remote management of security fixes and system updates can be exploited by hackers to run any desired program without the system user's and owner's knowledge or approval. Patches for the security flaw started rolling out before any real-world attacks had been reported, so it's not the end of the world. But now, well-respected technology advisors fear that the imperfect module could be used as an attack vector in new and unexpected ways. Intel needs to reassure its corporate users that the built-in system management tools won't become a brand new highway for hacker attacks. Failing to do so could drive many loyal Intel customers to competing chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and other rivals. Image source: Getty Images. How Intel could make me cash in those profits Mishandling the corporate processor market would be a grave mistake, so Intel most definitely needs to get back in the security saddle. Early patching of the recently disclosed security hole was a good sign, but it's all for naught if the fears of larger and deeper problems turn out to be true. If and when the results of this security scare start showing up in Intel's data center revenue reports, matched by AMD gaining ground in the same space, that would be a serious problem. Intel also needs to show that it has a real plan behind the Mobileye acquisition. The platitudes served up with the deal announcement don't always work out as planned, so I'm going to keep an eye on Intel's upcoming moves in the automotive computing market. The price tag for Mobileye stopped at roughly 30 times the company's trailing sales, so there's a massive growth premium included. I have no doubt that self-driving cars and other automotive computing advances will become a massive market with room for many large and successful players, but it isn't obvious that Intel will be among them. Finally, Intel shares have gained 23% over the past 52 weeks and are trading at fairly generous ratios of price to sales and enterprise value to free cash flows. This was done in the midst of a cooling PC market and the aforementioned execution errors. If the stock marches much higher without any significantly positive business triggers, it could make sense to take some profits off the table. And if I weren't such an Intel bull for the long term, these high prices could look like a warning sign -- it's a long way down if investors suddenly change their minds about Intel's fundamental value. Final Foolish words I'm not selling Intel today, and probably not in the near future. But these are the risks that keep me on my toes about the stock, and could push me up to the "sell" button at some point. I'll keep you posted if that happens.  Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Samsung, Intel Join FTC’s Antitrust Suit Against Qualcomm Samsung, Intel Join FTC’s Antitrust Suit Against Qualcomm By Joel Hruska on May 16, 2017 at 4:17 pm Comment Intel and Samsung have both joined the FTC’s lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing the smartphone SoC and wireless modem manufacturer of engaging in practices that violate antitrust law. Fair disclosure requires me to note that Intel’s brief is impossible to read without chortling. Anyone who recalls AMD’s antitrust lawsuits against Intel may have a similar problem, given Intel’s smug dismissal of AMD’s complaints at the time, compared with the outraged tone it takes in its own court filing against Qualcomm. According to Intel, Qualcomm has: [M]aintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits. These practices have coerced mobile-phone manufacturers (also known as “original equipment manufacturers” or “OEMs”) into purchasing the chipsets they need from Qualcomm and Qualcomm alone. The FTC’s detailed complaint documents the Qualcomm practices that have created that coercive business climate and stymied competition. Qualcomm’s behavior has inflicted and continues to inflict precisely the harms that the antitrust laws seek to protect against: harm to the competitive process, to consumer welfare, and to innovation and progress. Specifically, Intel argues that Qualcomm refuses to sell chipsets unless manufacturers purchase patent licenses and agree to pay Qualcomm revenue on every chipset sold, whether that chipset contains Qualcomm processors or not. It also argues that Qualcomm refuses to license Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) to its competitors, that it has arranged an exclusive (and below market price) deal with Apple to corner the market, and that Qualcomm has used a combination of patent licensing and exclusivity deals to prevent the smartphone market from functioning as a free and independent market. Now, don’t get me wrong — Qualcomm may well be found to have engaged in abusive behavior, and I’m not saying otherwise. But for Intel to complain about Qualcomm’s licensing and royalty structures after its own abuses is simply magical. Remember, Intel paid $1.2 billion to AMD to settle its antitrust case before it went to trial and was fined $1.45 billion by the EU. Its largest partner in crime, Dell, paid $100 million to settle SEC charges that the company misrepresented the impact Intel’s predatory rebate practices had on the OEM’s bottom line. Back then, Intel rebates were so critical to Dell earnings, that they were the only way the company could meet its consensus EPS estimates every single quarter from 2002 through 2006. In the first quarter of FY 2007, 76 percent of Dell’s operating profit came from Intel exclusivity payments — aka, Intel paying Dell not to use AMD products. It is, therefore, hilarious that Intel would go to the FTC to declare its inability to compete with Qualcomm. Samsung backs up Intel’s claims That said, Samsung, Intel, and the FTC are making a cohesive set of claims about Qualcomm’s business practices that may well stand up in court. Both Samsung and Intel argue that Qualcomm refuses to license its patents to competitors, despite holding essential patents that are functionally required to build an LTE modem (we’ve covered FRAND and SEP patent licensing in previous stories on this topic). This could put Qualcomm in violation of the Sherman Act alone, since SEP licensing issues have been previously found to trigger such clauses. Samsung’s filing is more narrowly tailored than Intel’s, and focuses more specifically on whether Qualcomm is required to license its patents to competitors under the rules that govern SEP and FRAND licensing in the first place. Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm is arguing that it has no legal requirement to license its patents. LTE market share, 2013. Qualcomm utterly dominated the LTE market back then. It’s harder to make objective determinations about whether companies have complied with patent license requirements, compared with whether one company’s products are readily available on store shelves. It makes this situation quite different from the earlier Intel-AMD lawsuit we alluded to (schadenfreude notwithstanding). We have certainly noticed before that Qualcomm faced robust competition in 2G and 3G modems, but dominated the 4G / LTE space to an unprecedented degree. That has changed somewhat, now that Intel, Samsung, and a handful of other companies have their own radios in-market. But Qualcomm had the market all but locked up for quite some time. Qualcomm has requested that the suit be dismissed, but the FTC has yet to rule on that proposal.

By Tina Bellon Published on 16. May 2017, 22:58 Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Delphi joins the alliance. Picture source: Reuters. German carmaker BMW’s already strong alliance in the race for building the car of the future just got another addition. UK-based technology car parts maker Delphi will join the group of BMW, chipmaker Intel and Israeli vision system Mobileye to create a self-driving car platform, intended to be sold to other carmakers and automotive system developers. The alliance, originally announced in July 2016, has set itself the ambitious goal to enter fully-automated cars into series production by 2021. Klaus Fröhlich, a BMW board member, said Delphi’s participation will strengthen the development of self-driving technology and move the alliance a step closer to spreading the technology across the automobile industry. Delphi’s main task will be to integrate the technologies of the other partners and to provide the required hardware components, such as sensors, the companies said. Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, which bought Mobileye for a whooping $15.3 billion in March, said the alliance was on track to deliver 40 pilot cars by the second half of the year. Delphi is no stranger to the collaborating partners – the Gillingham, UK-based company has already provided computing platforms to BMW and has worked on sensor and perception projects with Intel and Mobileye. The announcement marks the latest development in the competitive space of autonomous driving, a technology many companies regard as the future industry for carmakers and technology companies alike. German BMW rival Daimler last month announced a similar alliance with car parts supplier Bosch. On Monday, Alphabet’s self-driving unit Waymo said it was joining forces with ride-hailing service Lyft to develop autonomous cars.   Tina Bellon is an editor with Handelsblatt Global.

Delphi joins self-driving alliance with BMW, Intel Technology Tuesday 16 May 2017 - 10:54pm Employees of automotive supplier Delphi are pictured during a shift change in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, April 25, 2017. Photo: Reuters DETROIT - German automaker BMW AG, US chipmaker Intel Corp and parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC on Tuesday said they would collaborate on the development of a highly-automated self-driving platform for BMW, with Delphi handling integration of components and software. BMW said the new platform is intended to be sold to other vehicle manufacturers, which in turn may choose their own systems integrators to customise the platform to suit their vehicles. The cost, complexity and accelerated pace of development of self-driving vehicles continue to spark sweeping alliances between automobile manufacturers and suppliers. In April, rival German automaker Daimler AG formed a similar alliance with supplier Robert Bosch GmbH to speed development of self-driving vehicles. BMW on Tuesday said it expects that over time there will be "a fairly small number" of self-driving platforms shared by most carmakers because of the tremendous costs of integrating hardware, software and data. In April, Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc said it would make its new Apollo self-driving platform available to other companies. On Monday, Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit and ride services startup Lyft Inc announced a self-driving vehicle partnership. Waymo has been shopping its self-driving platform to global automakers and has modest deals with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co Ltd. Delphi will share with the BMW alliance some of the work it has been doing on a separate self-driving platform it is developing with Intel and Mobileye NV, the Israeli vision system and mapping expert that is being acquired by Intel, said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer. Delphi also may provide radar and other sensors to the BMW self-driving platform, which is targeted for production in 2021.

The laptop comes with a high-end PixelSense display with 3.4 million pixels, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD and weighs under 3 pounds for US$999. Reviews from PCWorld, PC Advisor, PCMag and others give it 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5. Now we're learning from Bloomberg and KGI Securities that Apple plans to announce an update to its MacBook lineup at their upcoming WWDC event in June.   Bloomberg reports that "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said."   The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for Apple. This month, Microsoft debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft's first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac's recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier.   The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. For more on this story click here.   Bloomberg's report is supported by a note by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities who goes one step further by saying that the 15" model will offer 32GB RAM. Whether that's standard or an option wasn't clarified, though its likely the latter. The impression from KGI is that production for the new MacBook's will only begin in July.   And lastly, the Korean report states that "the KGI Securities examiner expressed that the MacBook Pro 2017 would most likely be outfitted with various updates. Kuo noticed that this MacBook Pro 15-inch model may display a test for the Cupertino-based tech giant. The MacBook Pro 2017 15-inch variation will be the most significantly redesigned gadget this year. It has been said that the MacBook Pro 2017 will have a $1,200 sticker price for the base model."   In the end rumors now have a new Siri-centric Speaker device, a new 10.5" iPad Pro and last but not least a MacBook refresh launching at WWDC 2017. Will everything rumored actually come to life next month at WWDC 2017? While only time will tell, Apple fans will no doubt be glued to Apple's Keynote viewable live on Apple TV in the hopes that all products will indeed by announced.   With Apple's biggest competitors now introducing products well before Apple's fall events on a continual basis, it would be great to see Apple shake things up so as to not give their competitors any early advantage.  Whether this year is simply an anomaly or a new trend isn't known just yet, but it would be a positive move if their WWDC event was used as a launching pad for some of Apple's future products.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

But Macs are key to retaining the business of loyalists and the creative industries -- the cornerstone of Apple’s resurgence at the turn of the millennium under Steve Jobs. The MacBook refresh would also come at an important time for the iPhone-maker. This month, Microsoft Corp. debuted the Surface Laptop, which boots up in seconds, has a touch screen and runs on a more stable version of Windows. Microsoft’s first real laptop is widely considered a viable rival to the MacBook Air. By refreshing its computers, Apple could undercut that competition and continue the Mac’s recent momentum. In the second quarter, the company sold 4.2 million desktops and laptops and generated 14 percent more revenue on Macs than in the quarter a year earlier. The updated MacBook Pro would look much the same as the latest model and mostly differ in internal architecture, one of the people said. While unclear if it’s ready for this generation, Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro model that manages the computer’s low-power mode, Bloomberg News has reported. The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years. It has been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the MacBook Air. The most recent MacBook Pro, released more than 500 days after its predecessor, added a Touch Bar keyboard strip for quick access to app functions, a larger trackpad and a fingerprint log-in sensor. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in the spring of 2016 with a rose gold color option, while the MacBook Air has not received a speed boost since 2015. The stall in Mac updates has not been limited to laptops. Apple’s desktops have lagged too, and earlier this year, Apple pledged to release major upgrades to the Mac Pro and iMac with better specifications for expert users in the future. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Apple hasn’t announced upgraded hardware at its June developers conference since 2013, when it launched the Mac Pro and updated the MacBook Air. In addition to the new Macs this year, Apple will likely announce an upgraded version of the macOS operating system. At last year’s conference, the company announced the Sierra operating system, which added support for Siri, Apple Pay and iMessage improvements. Apple typically ships the new Mac software upgrades in the fall. For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast: Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Which Mac should you buy? With the new iPad, Apple keeps simplifying its product lines Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac Faced with pressure from Microsoft and declining iPad sales, Apple will announce updates to its MacBook laptops at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, according to a report by Bloomberg. Citing "people familiar with the matter," Apple will reveal three new laptops. A new MacBook Pro will sport Intel's Kaby Lake processor, an upgrade over the current Skylake-based models. Bloomberg says that the MacBook will also get a faster CPU, but doesn't specify what Intel part will be used. And perhaps to the surprise of Mac users, Apple may introduce a 13-inch MacBook Air with a faster processor. Bloomberg states that sales of the MacBook Air remain strong, despite the fact that Apple killed the 11-inch MacBook Air last October. Bloomberg reports that the new laptops won't have any design changes; the updates are speed bumps. But the update is important to help reinforce the idea that Apple is committed to the Mac, even if Mac sales make up only 11 percent of the company's revenue. In April, Apple met with select members of the media to discuss the company's Mac commitment and a revamp of the Mac Pro. WWDC tends to focus on Apple's operating systems. Expect to see major updates to iOS and macOS during the WWDC keynote on June 5. There's also been speculation that Apple could release a Siri Speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and the Google Home.

AMD, the company that used to provide a genuine challenge, just couldn’t produce CPUs of the same quality for a comparable price. But with its latest generation of Ryzen chips, AMD changed the game. They don’t blow Intel’s CPUs out of the water, but they provide real competition for the first time in a long time. The result from Intel has been swift, and awesome: a rumored new line of super-high-end CPUs, with technology improvements that should trickle down to everyone’s laptop. Don't Miss: This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed Yesterday, details leaked about an upcoming Intel CPU aimed firmly at professionals and seriously hardcore home users. It will be a 12-core processor, codenamed the Core i9, with a 150W TDP. That puts it far above the current top of the line, which is Intel’s Core i7 range. The Core i7 has been the highest-performing consumer chip for a long time. Although Intel does make more powerful Xeon processors for professional and server use, the designation of Core iX normally means it’s aimed at a more consumer-level build. Shaking up years of tradition with a Core i9 would indicate that Intel’s starting to see the need to reclaim its crown as the manufacturer of the most powerful CPUs. But that won’t be easy. Hours after the Core i9 leak, details about a challenger processor came out. Codenamed Ryzen 9, it’s rumored to have 16 cores, 32 threads, and a clock speed of 3.5GHz in normal mode, boostable to 3.9GHz. Just on paper, it sounds like AMD could challenge Intel, especially for non-gaming applications that rely more heavily on parallel processing. In the past, a raw number of cores hasn’t corresponded well to usable power, but AMD’s latest generation of Ryzen CPUs have offered great performance at a price much lower than what Intel can currently charge. Prices and release dates aren’t out yet, but the Computex trade show is coming up at the end of the month. Assuming that Intel and AMD both release full details there, these CPUs could be in computers shipping this summer. It’s a good time to be a PC user.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Surged Today Rumors of a licensing deal with Intel have emerged for a second time. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 16, 2017 at 3:34PM What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Tuesday after tech website Fudzilla reported that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had licensed AMD's graphics technology, replacing a deal with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) that expired in March. The stock was up about 10% at 2:45 p.m. EDT. So what Back in 2011, Intel and NVIDIA reached a six-year cross-licensing deal as the result of a legal dispute between the two companies. Intel agreed to pay NVIDIA $1.5 billion over the course of the deal, providing the graphics chip company with a significant boost to its bottom line. NVIDIA has seen its revenue and profit surge since then, driven by its gaming, enterprise, and automotive businesses, making the annual payment less important to the bottom line. Image source: AMD. Rumors of an Intel-AMD deal first surfaced in December, emerging from a different tech website. With neither company confirming the deal, it remains a rumor. If a deal has been reached, it's unclear whether a similar amount of money would be involved, given that the NVIDIA deal was the result of a lawsuit. Regardless, any licensing payments coming AMD's way will help the company return to profitability. Now what Intel would be licensing AMD's graphics-related intellectual property, allowing it to include integrated graphics in its CPUs without violating patents. It's highly unlikely that Intel would reach a deal to include AMD's GPUs in its products, as the original rumor seemed to suggest. Even if the amount of money is small, it should flow through to the bottom line for AMD. The company posted an adjusted loss of $117 million last year, so a new source of high-margin licensing revenue coupled with revenue from new product launches could make 2017 the year that AMD returns to the black. Investors shouldn't get too excited, though, until either AMD or Intel confirms the deal directly. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Intel Intel and AMD are going to war with next-gen CPUs Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 16th, 2017 at 3:25 PM Share Tweet For the longest time, Intel has been the only name that matters when it comes to the processor inside your PC. AMD, the company that used to provide a genuine challenge, just couldn’t produce CPUs of the same quality for a comparable price. But with its latest generation of Ryzen chips, AMD changed the game. They don’t blow Intel’s CPUs out of the water, but they provide real competition for the first time in a long time. The result from Intel has been swift, and awesome: a rumored new line of super-high-end CPUs, with technology improvements that should trickle down to everyone’s laptop. Don't Miss: This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed Yesterday, details leaked about an upcoming Intel CPU aimed firmly at professionals and seriously hardcore home users. It will be a 12-core processor, codenamed the Core i9, with a 150W TDP. That puts it far above the current top of the line, which is Intel’s Core i7 range. The Core i7 has been the highest-performing consumer chip for a long time. Although Intel does make more powerful Xeon processors for professional and server use, the designation of Core iX normally means it’s aimed at a more consumer-level build. Shaking up years of tradition with a Core i9 would indicate that Intel’s starting to see the need to reclaim its crown as the manufacturer of the most powerful CPUs. But that won’t be easy. Hours after the Core i9 leak, details about a challenger processor came out. Codenamed Ryzen 9, it’s rumored to have 16 cores, 32 threads, and a clock speed of 3.5GHz in normal mode, boostable to 3.9GHz. Just on paper, it sounds like AMD could challenge Intel, especially for non-gaming applications that rely more heavily on parallel processing. In the past, a raw number of cores hasn’t corresponded well to usable power, but AMD’s latest generation of Ryzen CPUs have offered great performance at a price much lower than what Intel can currently charge. Prices and release dates aren’t out yet, but the Computex trade show is coming up at the end of the month. Assuming that Intel and AMD both release full details there, these CPUs could be in computers shipping this summer. It’s a good time to be a PC user.

Digital Trends MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar review Apple's latest MacBook Pro is the first one we can't recommend. Here's why Share The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. Highs Exquisite look and feel Screen is among the best we’ve tested Loud, enjoyable speakers Spacious, responsive touchpad Top-tier hard drive performance Lows Adapters needed to connect most devices Keyboard is well below average Touch Bar lacks an obvious purpose Battery life takes a step back DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar review By Matt Smith Posted on 05.16.17 Research Center: Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar Have you grown bored of seeing your local Starbucks awash in silver, mid-sized laptops, all sporting that glowing Apple logo? We don’t blame you. Apple has remained committed to the MacBook Pro’s design over the last four years, counting on engineering excellence to persevere through multiple product cycles. That decision drove Mac fans wild, as many itched for a newer, faster Pro – and ended up with “new” models that looked the same as what they already owned. Now, the wait is finally over, and it’s unfortunate that Mac fans have been left starving for an update – because the new MacBook Pro’s price is hard to swallow. The base 13-inch model without the Touch Bar is $1,500, a $200 upcharge over the old entry-level Pro. If you want the Touch Bar model we reviewed, you’ll have to shell out $1,800, though you at least get a processor upgrade as part of the deal. $1,800 is a lot for a MacBook Pro 13 with a Core i5 processor, even by Apple’s standards. The sharp increase in price means you can only obtain a Core i5 MacBook Pro at prices that used to get you a Core i7, and perhaps a RAM upgrade as well. Can the new model live up to the expectations set by its price? Still the most luxurious laptop One look at the new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is all you need to know it’s a Mac. That’s even more impressive now that Apple has decided to take attention away from its branding, ditching the glowing white apple in favor of a slick, subtle gloss logo similar to what’s on the MacBook, the iPhone, and the iPad. As before, the MacBook Pro 13 features an all-unibody design lacking any visible seams aside from those on the bottom. But the new version is slimmer and trimmer, shaving weight down to 3.02 pounds from 3.48 pounds, while thickness drops from 0.71 inches to 0.59 inches. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends And that’s not all. Apple, like Dell, has aggressively shaved space from the display bezels to reduce the overall footprint. The new MacBook Pro 13 remains slightly larger than the Dell XPS 13 overall, and a couple tenths of a pound heavier. Users with the older Pro model will appreciate the improvement. Oh, and the new model comes in Space Gray, which hopefully is the beginning of a wider color selection. The 12-inch MacBook comes in Silver, Space Gray, Rose Gold, and Gold. Color choices may seem petty, but they add a touch of personality. There’s no arguing with the new MacBook Pro’s elegance. The beauty of Apple design has always been subtle, which is why the company is sometimes accused of being safe, or boring. The new Pro doesn’t even try to side-step those criticisms. It’s not the smallest 13-inch laptop, or the lightest, and its materials feel much as before. There’s something to be said for design that works, though, even if it’s not innovative, and the new MacBook Pro remains the most luxurious laptop around. Any port you want, as long as it’s USB Type-C While the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has a headphone jack, it makes another connectivity choice that’s just as controversial and, functionally, more important. Apple has decided that USB Type-C / Thunderbolt 3 is the future, and has ditched every other port. Yes, USB Type-C is all you get. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has four of these ports, two on each side. Even the card reader is missing. Crazy as it sounds, the decision has it benefits. The simplicity of the port selection is hard to argue with, and every port is a charging port, so you can plug the wall adapter into whichever is more convenient. The ports are quick, too, so you can hook up multiple displays or use fast external SSDs without worry about connectivity bandwidth. You’re going to need adapters, and you might need lots of them. Now, for the bad news – you’re going to need adapters, and you might need lots of them. Do you use an external display? That’s an adapter. External hard drive? Adapter. Wired input of any sort? Adapter. Ethernet? Adapter. SDcard? Adapter. At best, you’ll need to purchase one or two dongles. At worst, you’re going to need a dock solution, which can add another $100 to $200 to the price. The greatest irony? Even Apple’s iPhone can’t plug into any MacBook Pro 13 without purchasing an adapter. At least it can communicate wirelessly. Speaking of which, the new Pro 13 has the usual 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter paired with Bluetooth 4.2. It’s good to see the latest version of Bluetooth here, as it’ll help connect with a wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard of the future isn’t very good The 12-inch MacBook, released last year, debuted an all-new “butterfly” switch that’s much thinner than any used in a laptop keyboard prior. Though Apple touted it as having great feel, we complained that “typing for more than an hour [left our] fingers with a dull ache,” due to the keyboard’s stiff feel and limited travel. Now that same keyboard can be found on the MacBook Pro. Well, not exactly the same.  The Pro’s keyboard has a “second-generation butterfly mechanism,” with slightly more travel than the first. And it is an improvement. If you’re a writer, the MacBook Pro 13 will serve you better than the MacBook Pro 12. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends That’s not to say it’ll serve you well. While travel has improved, the keyboard continues to suffer a stiff, abrupt bottoming action that can make long typing sessions tiresome. The degree to which this will bother you is a matter of preference. A few Digital Trends writers thought it was perfectly acceptable, and most thought they could learn to live with it. No one said they preferred it over the previous MacBook Pro 13. And it’s not clear why this sacrifice was made. While the new MacBook Pro 13 is thin, it’s as thick or thicker than many competitors with better keyboards, such as the Acer Swift 7, HP Spectre, HP Spectre x360, and Dell XPS 13. Whatever the reason, it’s clear Apple had to make a compromise between size, performance, and keyboard quality, with the latter getting the bad end of the bargain. The keyboard suffers a stiff, abrupt bottoming action that can make long typing sessions tiresome. Below the keyboard is a revised, plus-sized touchpad. Unlike the keyboard, this is an unmitigated plus. The spacious surface improves the ease of using multi-touch gestures, which work consistently well. While the new, larger surface means constant contact between it and your palms, we didn’t notice a single instance of unintended input throughout our testing. And don’t forget Force Touch. The haptic feedback system, which uses vibration to simulate a click, is so good at emulating real movement that most users never notice a difference. It also offers force sensitivity, which can enable special interface functions – just like the iPhone. The feature isn’t widely embraced, even by Apple’s own software, but it’s great when offered. The Touch Bar searches for purpose In May of 2014, Apple Insider published an article talking about upcoming Macs with “in-key displays,” a rumor that began to snowball in early 2016. After several misses (the rumormills thought it might appear in early 2016, then in summer), it’s finally here in all its OLED glory. If nothing else, the Touch Bar is great to look at it. It boasts Retina-equivalent pixel density, which means icons are rendered with crisp, vibrant graphics. And because it’s OLED, blacks look inky black – so dark it’s often hard to find the Touch Bar’s boundaries. As a conversation starter, then, it holds up. As a functional tool? Less so. Apple tries to integrate the Touch Bar in a way that makes it relevant even in everyday web browser, note-taking, and photo-viewing. Its display changes constantly as new apps are opened, and old ones closed. It performs well, keeping up no matter how quickly apps are switched, or how many are open. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Yet there’s rarely much use for it. At best, it provides a quick way to scroll through lists, such as your Photo Stream. It can also be useful if you’d like to scroll through a video – and it’s great at picking up on such content, activating a scroll bar even when browsing YouTube. In other cases, though, it’s clearly a solution searching for a problem. Take typing, for instant. As you input text in Safari, Word, and other apps, the Touch Bar constantly flashes word suggestions. It’s a feature that works well on the iPhone, where typing is often slow and cumbersome. On a laptop, it’s pointless. Type in “office,” for instance, and the Touch Bar will suggest alternatives. Did you mean “officers”? Or, perhaps “off-season”? This happens whether a word is spelled properly or not. Even if you do slip in a typo, it’s hard to imagine why a user would look to the Touch Bar for help when MacOS already presents a correction on-screen and, in most cases, will correct the spelling automatically. Since its release, a growing number of apps now feature Touch Bar support — including Evernote, Microsoft Outlook, and LastPass. But even with more developer support than it had at launch, the Touch bar is still not quite as integral to the MacBook’s user experience as Apple would like it to be. If nothing else, the Touch Bar is great to look at it. Even where it might be useful, the Touch Bar is limited by its size. It automatically displays open Safari tabs, complete with miniature content previews, a feature that could prove helpful. Yet the previews are so small that it’s often hard to tell the tabs apart, even with just three or four open. If you open six, or eight, or ten tabs, then the previews become smaller still, until they’re so tiny that it’s hard to even tap the right one. Similar problems trouble its photo preview and video preview capabilities. In theory, you can scroll through photo collections. In practice, it’s harder to do than with the touchpad. In short, the Touch Bar isn’t great. But giving the function row over to an OLED display does come with an important perk called Touch ID. Yes, you can now log in with your fingerprint, and it works as seamlessly as it does on iPhone. Fast, secure login authentication methods are a great way to improve security for the average user. And Touch ID integrates with Apple Pay, so you can use it to securely make online purchases – from stores that accept Apple Pay. Display A quick look at the specifications could make you think Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 had an old display. It’s still Retina, which means the resolution is still 2,560 × 1,600. That was stunning in 2012, but today it seems mediocre next to QHD+ (3,200 × 1,800) and 4K screens. But don’t worry, Mac faithful. You can banish any concerns about the display from your mind. It’s fantastic. We measured a maximum brightness of 548 lux. That’s ridiculously brilliant, and complete overkill for use indoors, but it can help make the screen, which is still very glossy, usable in extreme situations. By comparison, the Dell XPS 13 with QHD+ display only hits 278 lux, and the HP Spectre x360 hits 355 lux. Both those systems can have a problem with glare in bright conditions, though Dell gives you the choice to combat that with a matte display option. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Brightness is only important in a bright room. What’ll stun you, no matter where you use the MacBook Pro 13, is its color. The display can achieve 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, as well as 91 percent of AdobeRGB. It also delivered an average color error value of .72 (lower is better). Anything below one is generally unnoticeable to the human eye, and this reading is the lowest we’ve ever recorded from a laptop. The previous record holder, Dell’s XPS 15, boasted an average error value of .78. Even the contrast ratio of 1,200:1 is excellent. The Pro can deliver dark blacks next to brilliant colors without trouble. The only flaw we found is gamma, which came in at a reading of 2.3. The ideal curve is 2.2, and the MacBook Pro 13’s result indicates it portrays content a bit darker than it should. But this is a very minor fluctuation, and plenty of competitors miss it, too. The Retina display may not be this Pro’s headline feature, but it remains its most attractive trait. When the numbers are tallied, the new Retina display comes away a winner. It defeats the Dell XPS 13, Acer Swift 7, Asus Zenbook 3, HP Spectre x360, and Lenovo Yoga 910, beating all of them in color gamut, color accuracy, and contrast ratio. That’s not to say it lacks competition, though. Microsoft’s Surface Book can go toe-to-toe with it. Though our tests found the Surface Book had a narrower contrast ratio of 1010:1, its gamma curve reading was the proper 2.2. There’s also a small handful of Windows systems, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga, available with OLED displays. These clobber the MacBook Pro 13’s strong contrast ratio, and deliver an even wider color gamut, all with accurate gamma. But they don’t match the Mac’s out-of-the-box color accuracy. Numbers aside, the display on the MacBook Pro 13 is excellent, and looks it in everyday use. Games and movies are crisp and vibrant, and high-quality photos render with such detail that you might think your display was switched with a canvas print. The Retina display may not be this Pro’s headline feature, but it remains its most attractive trait. Pump up the bass Apple has always shown an affinity for audio quality rarely found elsewhere, and the MacBook Pro is no exception. In fact, its speakers are the best we can recall hearing in a 13-inch system. That’s saying a lot, because a few recent laptops in this category, like the Asus Zenbook 3, have surprised us with their quality. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar Compared To Lenovo Ideapad 710S HP Spectre Acer Aspire S 13 S5-371-52JR Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with… Apple Macbook Pro 13-Inch (2013) Apple MacBook Air 13.3-inch… Apple MacBook 2009 Apple MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2008) Apple MacBook (2.4GHz, 2008) Apple MacBook Air (80GB) Apple MacBook Pro 15″ 2.4GHz Apple MacBook Pro 2.33GHz Apple MacBook 2.0GHz Apple MacBook Pro 15.4-inch 2.16GHz The MacBook Pro 13 offers a wide range of volume and, at maximum, it’s far louder than most people will need in normal use, and capable of filling a large room with tunes. Bass is present and accounted for in minimal but noticeable amounts – the thump can be felt through the keyboard at higher volumes. High and mid-range sound remains clear and free of distortion. External speakers will be an improvement, as always, but the audio quality present here is surprising, and may convince you there’s no need to plug anything into the headphone jack. A fast processor, facing stiff competition Specifications have never been Apple’s area of focus, but that used to be a marketing concern, rather than an indication of the company’s preference for hardware. Over the last few years, though, that has changed. The MacBook Pro fell behind, adopting new Intel processor lines late, or not at all. The new Pro only partially addresses the problem. Our entry-level MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has an Intel Core i5-6267U. As the numbers suggest, it’s part of Intel’s sixth generation Core line, rather than the newer seventh generation. Can it stand up to Intel’s latest hardware? For the most part, yes. The system’s Geekbench 3 multi-core score of 7,638 is not the best we’ve seen, but it’s certainly in range of competitors. The Lenovo Yoga 910 hit 7,973, and the Dell XPS 13 hit 7,835. Both were tested with Intel’s Core i7-7500U. The MacBook Pro 13 scored even better in Geekbench 3’s single-core metric, beating all competitors, if only by a hair. You might wonder how the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar can keep up, given it has an older architecture. The secret is the specific processor used by Apple. It has a 28-watt Thermal Design Power, while most Intel Core mobile chips are designed under a 15-watt Thermal Design Power. Put simply, the MacBook Pro 13 keeps itself competitive by drawing more juice under load. While the Pro does keep up, it’s still disappointing to see it stick with an older generation of hardware, especially given the price. The faster Core i7 competitors we tested can be had for hundreds less than the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar. Though quick, this level of performance is typical in laptops priced above $1,000. The hard drive to rule them all Drive performance is often overlooked by consumers, but it’s important to a system’s overall capability. Apple knows this, and has been a leader in storage performance for years. The new MacBook Pro line is no exception. It quotes read speeds of 3.1 gigabytes per second, and write speeds of 2.2 gigabytes per second. We can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with Windows competitors here, because the tools we normally use to test performance aren’t compatible with MacOS. However, we did test using two benchmarks that run only on Apple’s operating system. First up was Blackmagic, a test designed to tell professionals if a drive is up to the task of handling content at specific framerates and resolutions. It produced a write speed result of 1,348 megabytes per second, and a read result of two gigabytes per second (annoyingly, this appears to be the maximum result the benchmark can show). That’s a big improvement over the MacBook Pro 13 with Retina (2015). It hit a write speed of 647MB/s, and a read speed of 1,056MB/s. We also fired up DiskMark. It spat out sequential read performance of 1,826MB/s, and sequential write performance of 1,289MB/s.  We hadn’t tested with that benchmark before, so take the numbers with a grain of salt. Still, they’re good figures, and reasonably consistent with Blackmagic. Again, these benchmarks do not run on Windows, so we can’t make an apples-to-apples comparison of hard drive performance. But numbers we have from CrystalDiskMark, our Windows test, suggest Apple is at the head of the pack. The Dell XPS 13 with 512GB solid state drive scored a read speed of 1,285MB/s and a write sped of 572.8MB/s. The best drive performance we’ve seen from a Windows laptop came from the Vaio Z Flip. It scored read speeds of 1621.7MB/s, and write speeds of 1565.3MB/s. If this all sounds confusing, don’t worry. While the numbers are outstanding, you don’t need to obsess over them. It’s clear the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has outstanding drive performance, and it’ll handle any workload you ask of it. This is the most future-proof component in the entire system. Mac gaming is still a bad idea As in most past incarnations, the Apple MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar relies on Intel integrated graphics. If you want a more powerful discrete graphics solution, then you’ll need to accept the MacBook Pro 15’s larger footprint. With that said, our review unit did boast Intel Iris Graphics 550 which, in theory, should be much quicker than standard Intel HD graphics. Compared to Intel HD 620, the solution most common in modern Windows laptops, Iris Graphics 550 has double the execution units (48 vs. 24) and a higher maximum clock speed (1,100MHz vs. 1,050MHz). Better still, Iris Graphics 550 has 64 megabytes of dedicated eDRAM, something you’ll never find with Intel HD 620. But does that mean you can play games better than with a typical Windows ultrabook? To find out we fired up Civilization VI, testing it at 1,440 x 900 resolution on the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar, and on the same resolution on HP’s Spectre x360, with minimum detail and memory consumption selected. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The game performed identically – and poorly – on both, delivering 21 frames per second through the in-game benchmark. But the HP was the better experience, as the Mac suffered graphical glitches that weren’t present on the HP Spectre x360. If you’re curious why the game performs poorly despite greater technical capability, blame Apple’s OpenGL support, which hasn’t been updated significantly for years. Instead, the company prefers Metal, its own API which can be used on both iOS and MacOS devices. The problem? Porting a game from Windows’ popular DirectX API to Metal is unfamiliar territory. Developers of Windows PC games don’t have a good option for porting to the Mac, and the result is often performance that’s less impressive than you’d expect. You’ll have better luck with games ported over from iOS, such as CSR Racing Pro 3, Super Octagon, and Limbo. There’s a fair selection of such games on the Mac App Store. These also tend to suffer problems, though, especially in control, which is often poorly converted from touch to keyboard and mouse. A smaller battery leads to adequate endurance While the MacBook Pro 13 takes a step forward in processor performance, it takes a significant step back in battery capacity. The previous model had a 74.9 watt-hour battery, but the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has 49.2 watt-hour battery (the model without Touch Bar has a slightly larger 54.5 watt-hour battery). That’s a reduction in capacity of almost 35 percent. Despite that, Apple quotes the same battery life as before. The company obviously thinks that efficiency will make up for the smaller battery, but we didn’t find that to be the case. Peacekeeper, a looped web browsing benchmark, drained a full charge in five hours and three minutes. That’s not a bad result, but it’s not amazing, either. The Dell XPS 13 with Core i7 lasted five hours and seven minutes, while the Acer Swift 7 lasted five hours and 56 minutes. The HP Spectre lasted a tad bit less at four hours and 54 minutes. We also tested the system in a video loop, using iTunes. It drained the battery in ten hours and 17 minutes. That’s another solid result, though behind the HP Spectre x360, and barely ahead of the Lenovo Yoga 910. The Dell XPS 13 with Core i7 comes up a bit short here, hitting nine hours and 12 minutes. In real-world use, we found battery life to be average. Most 13-inch laptops priced about $1,000 can last through nearly a workday of a use, and the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar can, as well. But this assumes your “normal” use isn’t constant use, and that you stay away from demanding applications. Some users have noted that Safari seems to drain the battery more quickly than hoped. We’ve noted that, as well, even after the 10.12.3 update, which fixed a bug that caused Safari to use more graphics horsepower than needed. If you want amazing portability, you should aim for Dell’s XPS 13 with 1080p display and Core i5 processor. It lasted an outstanding six hours and 12 minutes in Peacekeeper, and twelve hours 43 minutes in our video loop. The MacBook Pro 13 used to be the last word in battery life, but the new model — or, at least, the Touch Bar version — has lost the crown. MacOS or Windows 10? You’ve probably already decided The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar of course runs MacOS, while most other laptops run Windows. For some, that’s all the information needed. If you prefer MacOS, then you’re going to need to buy a MacBook, and the new Pro models are the most powerful Mac laptops available. If you’re not familiar with Windows 10 and MacOS, give our reviews a read. We generally recommend Windows 10 over Apple’s operating system. It offers better task management, superior notifications, a more versatile digital assistant, and extensive cloud integration. MacOS does have strengths, though. It remains intuitive to use, and it works extremely well with iOS devices, as users can quickly share content between them or send text messages through the MacOS iMessage app. The usual warranty terms, with Apple Store convivence Apple ships every MacBook with a one-year warranty that includes 90 days of phone support. The terms are typical for the industry. The company’s retail stores give an edge, though, because owners can stop by for in-person support. That’s much more convenient than calling a hotline or shipping a system back – if you live near an Apple store, of course. Our Take Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a beautiful machine, but it has several flaws, and it’s far too expensive. Is there a better alternative? That depends on if you’d consider a Windows computer. If not, the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is an attractive option – though you should consider the model without Touch Bar first. It’s more affordable, and has a larger battery. The processor is not quite as fast, but the downgrade won’t be significant for most people. If you’re open-minded about choosing between Windows 10 and MacOS, there are numerous competitors. They include the Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre x360, Lenovo Yoga 910, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga with OLED, Surface Book, and Razer Blade. Many of these are a bit quicker, some have better battery life, and all offer a better keyboard. The Windows alternatives also offer an optional touchscreen, and some are 2-in-1 devices usable as either laptop or tablet. The main sacrifice you’ll make with these alternatives is display quality. Only Microsoft’s Surface Book, and the handful of OLED laptops currently available, can go toe-to-toe with the new Pro in that area. The DT Accessory Pack ProCase Sleeve Cover $16.99 Kensington SD4500 USB-C Docking Station $179.99 Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse $35 How long will it last? Apple has control of each Mac’s lifespan by dictating which systems will receive MacOS updates. Since the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar was just released, it’s safe to say it’ll last as long as any Mac currently available. Should you buy it? Probably not, even if you prefer a Mac. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is not a bad laptop. On the contrary, it’s good. But the $1,800 price tag demands more than just good. A laptop sold for that, as an entry-level model, must be among the best of the best. Former MacBook Pro models achieved that comfortably, but the new model is lacking. It doesn’t have a performance edge over alternatives in any area aside from hard drive speed, and battery life is merely competitive. Even the gorgeous display, which is very, very nice, just matches the best alternatives. We’re disappointed with Apple’s vision of cutting-edge computing. With the new MacBook Pro, Apple has ignored the best features offered by its competitors, while also introducing a Touch Bar of questionable use. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a great Mac – but it’s no longer a great laptop. Updated 5/12/2017 to include information about recently released Touch Bar-supported apps.

Bloomberg claimed Tuesday that MacBook Pro will get a faster Intel Kaby Lake processor. A new version of the current twelve-inch MacBook would pack in a faster Intel chip, too. It should be noted that the Mac maker hasn’t announced new hardware at WWDC since 2013, when it launched Mac Pro and updated MacBook Air. Apple and Intel declined to comment. Here’s a brief overview of the rumored MacBook upgrades: MacBook Pro—The same looks as the latest model, but with Intel’s faster Kaby Lake chips and updated internal architecture. It’s unclear if Apple’s rumored internally designed ARM-based chip for managing low-power mode is part of the new models. 12-inch MacBook—Last updated in spring 2016 with a rose gold color option, the ultra-thin machine will get a faster Intel chip. MacBook Air—Apple’s cheapest laptop has not received a speed boost since 2015, but its sales remain “surprisingly strong”. The company “has considered updating” the MacBook Air notebook with a new processor. Fun fact: it’s been almost seven years since Apple last redesigned the popular Air. In the March quarter, Apple sold 4.2 million Mac desktops and notebooks, generating fourteen percent more revenue on these systems than in the year-ago quarter. Previously, it pledged to release a modular Mac Pro system, all-new pro displays, refreshed Mac mini models and major upgrades to its all-in-one iMac desktop with better specifications. As mentioned, the upgraded Mac notebook lineup may be announced during Apple’s WWDC keynote, which takes place on Monday, June 5, at 10am Pacific Time. Asides from previews of the next major versions of iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS, Tim Cook & Co. may provide other updates during the keynote address, including announcements related to the company’s rumored AI-driven Siri smart speaker, 10.5-inch iPad Pro model, 4K-capable Apple TV and the discontinuation of the iPad mini lineup.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Finally Set to Whip Out "Core i9" Branding In its quest to drive up its personal computer processor mix, Intel is introducing the Core i9 branding. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 16, 2017 at 1:50PM Nearly a decade ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) introduced a new branding scheme for its personal computer processors -- a standard "good, better, best" scheme. A Core i3 processor represented the "good," a Core i5 processor represented the "better," and a Core i7 was the creme de la creme, representing the best consumer-grade processors that money could buy. That branding scheme is still in place today. Image source: Intel. That said, based on a recent, seemingly credible leak, Intel is planning to introduce the Core i9 branding with its upcoming Skylake-X high-end desktop (HEDT) platform. It's not clear if Intel plans to stick with a "good, better, best" scheme, with what would have previously been a Core i3 becoming a Core i5, a Core i5 becoming a Core i7, and a Core i7 becoming a Core i9, or if Intel plans to keep the Core i3 around while introducing the Core i9 as a sort of "extreme" product tier. In this column, I'd like to offer up my thoughts on the introduction of the Core i9 brand for the company's ultra-high-end processors. It's about time To be perfectly frank, it's really about time that Intel introduced the Core i9 branding. Under the current branding structure, Intel's highest-priced, highest-end desktop processors aren't marketed in a way to convince the average computer buyer that there's anything special about them compared to the much cheaper, lower-end desktop processors. To put things into perspective, Intel will sell desktop users a Core i7-7700K for around $340 while also offering a Core i7-6900K for around $1,000. The average, relatively uninformed computer buyer (e.g., most computer buyers) will see that a system powered by a Core i7-7700K is a Core i7-based computer and that the Core i7-6900K-based machine also has a Core i7. If the Core i7-6900K (which has twice the number of processor cores as well as additional PCI Express lanes and twice the memory channels) were labeled as the Core i9-6900K, then perhaps systems based on it would have sold better in the marketplace. Indeed, system vendors would probably have a much easier time moving systems with these types of chips if they could easily communicate that the chips inside are "better" than the ones with the more standard Core i7 chips. I think Intel and its partners realized this, which probably explains the rumored branding change. The desired impact At the end of the day, Intel's goal is quite simple: It wants to try to get consumers to buy a richer product mix to boost its processor average selling prices and ultimately increase revenues/profits in a challenging overall personal computer market. The Core i9 branding should help in this regard. The branding obviously isn't going to have much, if any, impact on the buying habits of die-hard, highly informed personal computer enthusiasts -- this subset of customers likely doesn't care what these chips are called. But for the typical computer buyer who walks into a big-box retail store and asks the sales representative to assist him or her in purchasing a new gaming computer, the higher Core i9 tier could make a real difference in some customers' purchasing decisions, a difference that could mean a richer product mix for Intel and for personal computer vendors.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Intel, the BMW Group, and the folks at Mobileye have announced that they will onboard Delphi as a development partner for their autonomous driving platform. This comes after a July 2016 announcement that Intel, BMW, and Mobileye would be joining forces for autonomous vehicles – with Delphi, the dream of self-driving cars takes another step closer to reality. The team of three are collaborating to “bring fully automated vehicles into production by 2021. Today’s announcement suggests that Intel, BMW, and Mobileye will be jointly deploying a cooperation model “the deliver and scale the developed solutions to other automotive OEMs, and potentially other industries.” In this move, Mobileye, Intel, and BMW are intending to integrate and industrialize level 3 to level 5 automated driving technology, and to do so for multiple automotive OEMs. See the video below this paragraph for more information on Intel’s 5 levels of autonomous driving technology. Delphi’s contribution to this project is the group’s automated driving expertise, which they will “leverage… to assist the cooperation in the development and initial deployment of their automated driving technology.” Delphi has worked with the BMW Group to provide a “prototype compute platform” to allow BMW to move forward in the field. Delphi is with Intel and Mobileye on sensor fusion, perception, and “high performance automated driving computing.” Of special note: “this engagement between Delphi and [the other three partners] is non-exclusive.” “This agreement won’t slow down our previously announced automated driving solution called the Centralized Sensing, Localization and Planning Platform (CSLP), which Delphi, Mobileye and Intel are developing — a turnkey AD solution based on the Ottomatika software, our computing platform, and our sensors,” said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s chief technology officer. “In fact, one of the most exciting aspects of today’s announcement is the potential to align our work on the CSLP Platform with the work BMW, Intel, and Mobileye are doing as part of their cooperation.” This is just part of the story and the latest in a line of collaborations between these various companies. In August of 2016 it was announced that Delphi and Mobileye were joining forces. The collaboration between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye was announced in July of 2016.

McMaster Gives a Presser on the Alleged Trump Security Blunder (VIDEO) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter BREAKING. H. R. McMaster Gives a Presser on the Alleged Trump Security Blunder (VIDEO) Posted at 1:24 pm on May 16, 2017 by streiff Share on Facebook Share on Twitter President Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, just finished up a presser on the outrage du jour, the Washington Post story that Donald Trump inappropriately shared highly classified information with Russian Prime Minster Sergey Lavrov. Personally, I like McMaster and thought he did as well as could be done considering no one in the briefing was predisposed to do anything but scream RUSSIA!!! But I realize I’m going to be in a minority position on RedState in that belief. These are the highlights. [&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”//storify.com/streiff/mcmaster-presser” target=”_blank”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;View the story “McMaster Presser” on Storify&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;] Unsurprisingly, they dovetail with what NBC was reporting earlier today. Us intel official tells me trump told russians about laptop airline threat. Told it wasnt anything they didnt already know. @washingtonpost — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) May 16, 2017 Us intell official says trump was trying to show russians "how cooperative he wants to be with them" in fight against isis. @washingtonpost — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) May 16, 2017 Us intel official says Trump talked abt isis interest in laptops, which is why laptops of such concern these days. Says not new info — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) May 16, 2017 Trending BREAKING: Israel's Statement on Trump Leaking Their Intel to Russia Jay Caruso Key points. First, McMaster says he stands by his statement of yesterday which is that the story is false. Unlike some of my colleagues and most of Twitter, I don’t see the ambiguity of his denial. He said, “The story that came out tonight as reported is false.” I don’t know how you can get any clearer than that, it isn’t a denial of details or hedging it is a denial of the story. If the story “as reported” is false then the Washington Post story is false. The point about leaks being the issue is a critical one, but I’ll hit that in a second. McMaster said what was shared was appropriate. He also says it was nothing that couldn’t be found in open source reporting. There have been some comments to the effect that McMaster “didn’t deny” which city the information came from. In fact, he said quite clearly that all the information was available via open source reporting and, therefore, any city Trump might have mentioned has already been mentioned in an unclassified environment. The statement that is getting the most attention is this: McMaster: "The president wasn't even aware of where the information came from. He wasn't even briefed on the sources and methods." — Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) May 16, 2017 This is being portrayed as Trump being stupid or something. All it means is that the information Trump had on the subject did not identify sources or methods and, as McMaster said, was available from open source reporting. When I was doing a stint in Army War Plans division, we tried to sanitize information as much as possible. If a quote from TIME or Newsweek was accurate we’d include it in intel summaries rather than codeword information just to make it easier to deal with the security requirements. Holding that thought, let’s go back to the leaks bit and why they are dangerous and let me draw on my friend Erick Erickson’s piece in The Resurgent (which seems to be down right now) headlined I Know One Of the Sources. In that story, Erick speaks of aids feeling like Trump doesn’t listen to them but he does listen to the press, so they leak these stories to embarrass Trump publicly in order, they hope, to make him change his ways. This is unprofessional, dangerous, sad, and pathetic. In this case, suppose McMaster is telling the truth–and when the day comes that you take the word of unnamed sources over McMaster we’ve really nothing else to talk about–and Trump did share with the Russians information that was available from open source reporting. And that Trump had been briefed on the information in a sanitized form with sources and methods omitted. Now, thanks to the leak, the Russians know that information was not open source but that we have a highly placed source inside ISIS being run by an allied intelligence service. If you think for a second there is an allied intelligence service in the fight against ISIS that isn’t working hand in glove with the Russians, think again. Over the past eight years, the foreign policy choices made by the Obama administration increased the profile of Russia in the Middle East. The SVR is now working to identify which service is running the asset and they will do that in short order. So the short-sighted decision to show the boss he’s a dumb fu** has now fully compromised not only a source inside ISIS but possibly a sympathetic intelligence officer in a service that might not be 100% friendly to freelancing by its officers. Think Jonathan Pollard for a second. One of the first rules of mitigating the damage caused by compromising classified information is that you dummy up and act like everyone knew that anyway so as to not call attention to the compromise. If the story were true, what the leakers did was indistinguishable from what Trump did with the exception being that the leakers knew they were telling the Russians they’d heard classified information. So any lives that were put in danger were done so by the leakers who let the Russians know the information Trump mentioned was both accurate and very sensitive. More to the point, this changes nothing. If you believed Trump was an idiot and a Russian tool when you heard this, you still do, and now you believe McMaster is a tool and a liar. And that is just the way it is. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: Donald Trump h. r. mcmaster Recent Stories Trey Gowdy: Show Me The Memo! (VIDEO) Caleb Howe Comey Memo Update.

Munich – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, May 16, 2017 BMW displays 1 of the first highly automated vehicles that were announced by BMW, Intel and Mobileye during a one-day autonomous driving workshop on May 3, 2017, at Intels Silicon Valley Center for Autonomous Driving in San Jose, CA (Credit: Intel) The BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye (Cooperation Partners) announce their intention to onboard Delphi as a development partner and system integrator for their state-of-the-art autonomous driving platform. The four partners intend to jointly deploy a cooperation model to deliver and scale the developed solutions to the broader OEM automotive industry and potentially other industries. Delphi has already provided a prototype compute platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion and high performance automated driving computing. In July 2016, the BMW Group, Intel, and Mobileye announced that they are joining forces to make self-driving vehicles become a reality and are collaborating to bring solutions for highly and fully automated driving into series production by 2021. The Cooperation Partners have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state-of-the-art designs and create differentiated brands. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel System integrators, such as Delphi, are critical for the go-to-market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly. A key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures. Additionally, Delphi may also provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. This engagement between Delphi and the Cooperation Partners is non-exclusive. The Cooperation Partners are in the process of onboarding additional integration and development partners to support future OEM customer needs. Executive Quotes From the very beginning we designed our cooperation on a non-exclusive platform for this technology of the future. With the onboarding of Delphi we significantly strengthen our development of the automated driving and do a future step in spreading this technology across the industry, stated Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. The partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye continues to break new ground in the auto industry, said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving and are on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year. Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers. Collaboration and inclusion across multiple automakers and suppliers is the best approach to developing a safe, cost-efficient and fast-to-market solution for autonomous driving, said Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileyes co-founder, chairman and CTO. Delphis expertise in the field, as well as long history of integrating complex systems, makes them a very appropriate choice to join this cooperation. This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience with automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation develop and deploy at scale. Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success, said Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Delphi. #futureofdriving2021 #bmwintelmobileye The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the worlds leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Het bordje beschikt over een Intel Atom x7-Z8750-quadcore, 4GB lpdrd3-1600-werkgeheugen en embedded 32GB emmc-opslaggeheugen. Hetzelfde bordje wordt gebruikt in de ready to fly-drone, waarbij je zelf dus niet meer hoeft te knutselen om aan de slag te gaan. De lijst met aanpassingen voor deze bsp-uitgave ziet er als volgt uit: Intel Aero v1.3.1 release Fix issue with power button not working on RTF Intel Aero v1.3 release Fix bug in mavlink-router startup script after update of ps utility: it's now possible again to stop mavlink-router Update mavlink-router: No longer spams stderr with warnings (some of them needed to be fixed and some are now aggregated and ratelimited) Detect PX4 and ArduPilot flight stacks automatically for logging Use meta-intel-aero with better compiler optimization options Update base Yocto Project version from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2, but keep kernel at same revision Start using os-release rather than custom OS release file Make aero-reboot-update correctly parse /etc/os-release on both current and update image Intel Aero v1.2 release New update procedure that does not require USB hub and monitor connected. Update is still done with a USB drive connected, but the update can be triggered by just connecting the board via WiFi or usb-ethernet. LEDs are used for monitoring the update. New packages added: RealSense ROS node, libavahi-client, efibootmgr, rng-tools tar, ps and top are no longer provided by busybox ssh daemon is now provided by OpenSSH, also providing sftp for easy file transfer Updated iwlwifi driver, wpa-supplicant and hostapd to help fix connection drops Wi-Fi Access Point starts 5 seconds faster and no longer requires the password several times Wi-Fi default network is now on 192.168.8.x to avoid conflicts with default IP ranges used by home routers mavlink-router updated providing: Configuration file with endpoints, being easier to change Default baudrate to talk to flight stack changed to 460800, which is the advised baudrate to avoid packet loss Flight stack logging for both PX4 and ArduPilot, which are now kept in /var/lib/mavlink-router/logs Bug fixes in general Updated binary for PX4: close to release 1.6 of PX4 upstream, providing: Improved flight stabilization with much better tunning (This needs a frame reset and complete sensor calibration with QGroundControl) Support to save waypoints Logging FPGA firmware changes: Version information Recovery FPGA firmware for RTF that allows instructing the flight controller to stop on bootloader All firmwares are now available on /etc/fpga Firmwares are built from open source repository at https://github.com/intel-aero/intel-aero-fpga The jam tool to flash FPGA firmware now accepts absolute paths All tools related to Aero board have now being renamed and prefixed with "aero-", which makes them easier to find. Symbolic links are kept to ensure backwards compatibility, but these are going to be removed in future.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why This Intel Corporation Chip Rumor Seems Bogus Two bits of information in this so-called "leak" don't seem to make sense. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 16, 2017 at 10:30AM Over on social media, Richard Swinburne shared the following image, which he said came from a post from "Uruguay OC," also on social media: Image source: Uruguay OC via social media. This image purportedly represents the box art of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming Core i9 processor for gaming enthusiasts based on the company's Coffee Lake architecture. At first glance, this looks legitimate enough -- the box art is awful, just as it has been with recent generations of Intel processors. The tag line of "FOR THE ULTIMATE SMART HOME EXPERIENCE" also sounds like something that Intel's marketing department would cook up. However, there are a couple of things that don't quite pass the sniff test for me. The model number seems wrong Intel sells two lines of desktop processors to gamers and personal computer enthusiasts -- "mainstream" parts, and then "high-end desktop" (HEDT) parts. The HEDT parts generally have model numbers in the form of i7/i9-X8XX and i7/i9-X9XX. Since the HEDT parts are positioned higher in Intel's product stack than the mainstream parts, the mainstream parts tend to have designations in the form of i5-X6XX/i7-X7XX. Image source: Intel. Based on that, I find the model number here (i9-8990K) suspect. Not only would this not allow Intel to launch HEDT parts with a leading "8" digit (since the second and third digits are both "9"), but such model numbering would make it appear to the average consumer that it is higher-end than the company's soon-to-be-launched HEDT chips that max out at i9-7920X. Granted, Intel could say that customers could differentiate between HEDT and mainstream parts by looking at the suffix of the model number ("K" versus "X"), but that would probably create much more confusion than it's worth. Not just the model number It's not only the model number that doesn't make sense to me -- the socket that the box says it's designed for is suspect, too. Chips designed for desktop computers can generally be swapped in/out, and the parts of the motherboard that the chips go into are called "sockets." Now, a user can't just take any chip and plug it into any socket -- a chip needs to be designed specifically for that socket for it to plug into it and work. This leak indicates that this "i9-8990K" requires an LGA-1152 socket to work. Intel's sixth-generation and seventh-generation Core processors use the LGA-1151 socket, and the prior-generation fourth-generation Core chips (as well as the select fifth-generation Core chips that Intel launched for desktops) used the LGA-1150 socket. On the surface, it would seem sensible to expect that if this pattern holds, the eighth-generation Core chips would require a new socket. Here's why I'm skeptical, though. Back in January, Intel's motherboard partners launched a bunch of new motherboard designs based on Intel's Z270 chipsets. They were designed specifically to work with Intel's seventh-generation Core processors (older Z170-based motherboards could use the seventh-generation Core chips as well, and Z270 boards can use sixth-generation Core chips). If Intel launches the upcoming eighth-generation Core chips in August, as DigiTimes claims is happening, and if those chips aren't compatible with the Z270 boards, then the existing inventories of Z270-based motherboards sitting out there in the distribution channels would become virtually unsalable at anything resembling current prices. At the very least, if the new chips can work in the Z270-based boards, then inventories of said boards would still be salable with relatively modest discounts. This inventory situation wouldn't be as much of a concern in the case of eighth-generation Core incompatibilities if the Z270 boards were given a full lifespan, and/or the original plan of record called for Z270 to be "obsoleted" within seven to eight months. However, since the reported August launch of the eighth-generation Core chips is said to have been a pull-in from the original schedule, I doubt suitable plans were in place to handle a potential inventory situation. To that end, I think it's quite likely that the upcoming eighth-generation Core chips will plug into the same LGA-1151 socket that the sixth- and seventh-generation Core processors do, ultimately proving that the image that we're trying to analyze is a fake.

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) is up 16% since the beginning of the year and a stunning 64% since May of 2016. Any way you cut it, that a huge move, and that’s the kind of parabolic lift that gets the bears revved up and the negativity flowing. A new Deutsche Bank research report makes the case that the semiconductor vendors themselves are very positive about demand, pricing, cost and capacity, which are always the four major areas of concern in what is a highly cyclical arena. The analyst is especially bullish on what the auto sector adds to the chip stocks. The Deutsche Bank report said this: A promising area of semiconductor growth, the Automotive end-market(~10-15% of semiconductor industry revenues per SIA and Deutsche Bank estimates) has outgrown the semi industry by an average of roughly +7 percentage points since 2013, a trend that we see continuing directionally in 2017 with roughly +5 percentage points of outperformance. Deutsche Bank favors five Buy-rated stocks now, and here we cover the four that are primarily traded in U.S. dollars. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a big part of the shift. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Earlier this year, Intel announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. This is a big IoT segment going forward. Autonomous driving could prove to be huge, and the analysts noted this in the report: Intel expects the computing total addressable market (TAM) in Autos to significantly outpace vehicle unit TAM. By Intel’s estimates, autonomous cars will demand 10x increase in compute throughput, a 1,000x increase in pixels and 1,000x increase in storage between 2017 and 2030. In dollar terms, that translates to in-car TAM (systems, data and services) of $70 billion and another $40 billion of TAM for autonomous driving-related data center spending. Intel investors are paid a solid 3.07% dividend. The Deutsche Bank price target for the stock is $43, and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $39.90. The stock closed Monday at $35.63 per share. Maxim Integrated Products This company supplies chips to Samsung for the Galaxy line. Maxim Integrated Products Inc. (NASDAQ: MXIM) designs, develops, manufactures and markets various linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits worldwide. The company also provides a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities for use in custom designs. It primarily serves automotive, communications and data center, computing, consumer and industrial markets. The Deutsche Bank reported noted: Regardless of which processor wins supremacy in Automotive, Maxim stands poised to benefit with its Power Management and SERDES content as autonomous cars require leading power efficiency and data distribution. Moreover, the company should see a linear benefit with additional content needed for greater levels of autonomous-driving features in future generations of automobiles. Shareholders are paid a 2.82% dividend. Deutsche Bank has a $50 price objective for the shares, and the posted consensus target price is $47.74. The shares closed on Monday at $46.82 apiece.

According to reports from Fudzilla, a website focused on IT news, Intel may have opted to sign a new licensing deal with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) instead. “We can now confirm the rumors that Intel has given up on Nvidia because it has written a cheque to license AMD’s graphics,” the Fudzilla report said. Nvidia shares were trading up about 1 percent, while AMD shares are up more than 8 percent on news of a potential Intel deal. Related Link: Here's What You Missed From Nvidia's Analyst Day While no details are being reported, Intel’s previous licensing deal with Nvidia was worth $200 million annually. An AMD spokesperson wouldn’t confirm the deal, but said management may address the issue today during the company’s analyst day event. The spokesperson provided the following statement to Benzinga: “We haven’t announced any licensing deals with Intel and, as a matter of policy, don’t comment on rumor or speculation. We do have our financial analyst day this afternoon and will have an executive QA session, so the question may come up from someone in the room and be addressed then. For now, we aren’t commenting on the speculation per corporate policy.” Intel and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fudzilla reports that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a GPU licensing deal in place with Imagination Technologies, but the company recently announced it will be terminating its relationship with Imagination next year. Raja Koduri, senior vice president and chief architect of AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group division previously worked at Apple and worked closely with Intel as well.

While Dell turned heads back in 2015 with its Infinity Display on the XPS 13, you have to decide if you want an Ultrabook, a tablet, a convertible like the Yoga Book, or to just use your phone. Today I'm going to take a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. This is the 5th generation of the X1 Carbon, and as its name implies, it's built with a carbon-fiber reinforced chassis. Starting at just over $1,300, the device sports a thin bezel (although not Infinity Display thin), solid construction, and the iconic Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard, complete with TrackPoint (the red mouse nub). Specifications The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes in five base configurations, ranging in price from $1,322 all the way up to $2,340. All of the configurations provide the same form factor as well as the same 14" Full HD (1920x1080) IPS screen. It's important to note that the X1 Carbon does not offer a touch version, which seems strange for a new release, although a new Quad-HD display is expected in June so Lenovo may add touch to that screen. All of the displays are powered by an on-board Intel Graphics 620 card. The base configuration has an Intel Core i5-7200u processor and comes equipped with a tiny 128GB SATA3 SSD, which I doubt many people will keep. It also includes 8GB of RAM, a 720p webcam, a fingerprint sensor, a ClickPad with three dedicated mouse buttons, and a TrackPoint for the old-school users. If you want to equip your ThinkPad X1 Carbon with 16GB of RAM, you'll need to bump up the CPU, as that requires the Intel Core i5-7300U or i7-7600U. The RAM is soldered onto the board though, so if you want to upgrade, you need to do it at the time of purchase. The model that Lenovo provided me for the review was powered by the Intel Core i5-7300 running at 2.60GHz, had 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Wireless connectivity is handled by the Intel Dual Band Wireless AC(2x2) 8265 chip, which also supports Bluetooth 4.1. In addition, for those who need to be online while on the move, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon has an option to install a Qualcomm Snapdragon X7 LTE-A modem for an additional $140. When it comes to connectivity, the X1 Carbon sports two Intel Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C), one of which can be used to charge the device, two USB 3.0 ports (USB-A, one one each side of the laptop), and a full-sized HDMI port. There's also a standard headphone jack and a Kensington lock port. Along with what was described above, there's a Discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM) chip embedded in the machine. This is the most secure implementation of TPM, due to the fact that it's a dedicated chip, thus reducing the ability to attack it via software. Design The design of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon isn't going to turn heads at the airport or make your friends jealous. It's not an ugly design by any means: The bezel is unobtrusive, the screen is sharp and bright, the shell is rubbery and grippy, and the carbon fiber gives the device a premium feel. The one negative, however, is that the matte rubber surface collects smudges fairly easily. One of the best design decisions Lenovo made was with the laptop hinge. With the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, you have the ability to open the screen 180 degrees to lay the device down perfectly flat. I found that it was great to have the laptop completely open while sitting on the couch and reading websites. The only thing that could've improved the design here would've been a touchscreen so that it's easier to scroll through pages. Once you sit down and start using the device, you notice the little things that Lenovo did to make the X1 Carbon a pleasure. If you're a fan of the traditional Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard, it's still intact here, with the iconic nub (TrackPoint) between the G/H/B keys for those who prefer it to the ClickPad. Speaking of the ClickPad, instead of using virtual buttons like many other laptops, there are three physical buttons placed above, and two hidden mechanical buttons at the bottom. Operating System The lower end devices comes pre-installed with Windows 10 Home edition, which is a strange decision by Lenovo considering the target market is clearly the enterprise. The upgrade to Windows 10 Pro is only $30, so I suspect most people will either order one of the more expensive models, or simply pay for the upgrade. Inputs The X1 Carbon sticks with its roots in the input department, coming equipped with the standard high quality ThinkPad keyboard, the TrackPoint, and a ClickPad. Sadly, as we'll discuss later, the device does not have a touchscreen. The keyboard is the star of the show, as anyone who has used a Lenovo laptop before can attest to. The keys are raised up fairly high and have a good springy feel to them so that you definitively know when you've pressed one. The keys are also full sized and have a good amount of space between them, making using the keyboard similar to that of a desktop. If you like to have a back-lit keyboard, you can turn that feature on by pressing the function key and the space bar. The X1 Carbon has dedicated page up and page down buttons, unlike some of its competitors, which is extremely handy when browsing websites, especially given the lack of a touchscreen. The keyboard isn't perfect though, and the biggest issue for me is the fact that the function key is placed to the left of the control key. As someone who uses control shortcuts, I found myself pressing the wrong key many times and trying to figure out why it wasn't working. This is a personal preference, and something that one would get used to with repeated use, but since most manufacturers put the control key all the way to the left, I'm not sure why Lenovo didn't follow suit. When it comes to mouse controls, you have two options with the X1 Carbon: The iconic red TrackPoint (aka: pencil eraser or nub), and the ClickPad. Lenovo has kept the standard TrackPoint from the old IBM days. For those who haven't used it before, the TrackPoint is a little red nub that sits in the center of the laptop, and by pushing it in different directions, you control the pointer on the screen. It's been a great input device for years, and in addition to the fine tuned control it provides, it also lets you move the mouse cursor without pulling your hands off of the home row of the keyboard. Unfortunately, I encountered a serious flaw with the TrackPoint on the Carbon X1: The ClickPad's integrated mouse clicks don't seem to work with the TrackPoint. When pressing the left mouse button on the ClickPad, and then dragging the mouse with the TrackPoint, the system releases the click after a fraction of a second, making it impossible to select text in a Word document, use MS Paint, or any number of other things. The TrackPoint does still work with the physical mouse buttons at the top of the ClickPad, though. For those who don't want to use the TrackPoint, the ClickPad works great and acts like most other trackpads you've used in the past, including the standard array of finger gestures to scroll and zoom. For example, tapping four fingers on the Clickpad brings up the Windows Notification Center, and swiping with three fingers lets you replicate the Alt-Tab functionality to switch between apps. Where Lenovo's implementation is a little different than some others is the fact that in addition to the three physical buttons above the ClickPad, there are also two hidden buttons at the bottom. Pressing them gives a good "click," so you know you did it right, unlike the virtual ones that are available on some other offerings. I thought I'd end up using the top buttons more than I actually did. With all of the recent laptops not having these physical buttons, I find I'm missing them less and less, but it's still a good feature to add for those who want it. Battery Lenovo claims that the ThinkPad Carbon X1 has a battery life of "up to 15 hours." That's a generous assessment for any mobile device, but I found that in my testing of the device, it never really came close to that. That said, under normal use of browsing websites, typing up some documents, and watching an occasional YouTube video, I was easily able to last just over 10 hours with the brightness set to roughly 50%. Your mileage will obviously vary based on what you're doing, but the battery life definitely does not disappoint. Perhaps more importantly is how quickly the battery charges. The X1 Carbon uses a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port to charge, and can go from 0% to 80% in roughly an hour. That's enough charge to give you another 8 hours of normal use. Screen The screen is the one thing that really disappointed me about the X1 Carbon. From recent reviews, I've come to expect not only a high quality screen, but one that also provides touch as an input. Although I've seen many people say touch is not necessary, it definitely does make a device easier to use, and I frequently found myself trying to scroll through webpages or click buttons by pressing the screen, so the lack of that feature is a severe disadvantage compared to Lenovo's competitors. The screen resolution is limited to only Full HD (1920x1080), and while this isn't a show stopper, it's nice to hear that Lenovo is planning on releasing a Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display in June, although I didn't receive any other details about the upcoming release. The screen itself has good brightness, at 300 nits, and the display is sharp and crisp. In some ways, the lack of a QHD display is a good thing, as Windows 10 occasionally has scaling issues when running older software, and with only a 14" screen, the additional resolution isn't strictly necessary. For those who want to save battery life, running at 30% brightness in a normal office environment was still easy to use. Audio As with any Ultrabook, we have modest expectations when it comes to audio because there's just no way for manufacturers to bypass the laws of physics when it comes to the size and depth of a speaker. The X1 Carbon places the speakers on the bottom of the laptop, underneath the palm rest. The result is a mixed bag. When using the device on a flat surface, the sound is actually pretty good, for a laptop. Cranking the volume up doesn't cause much distortion, and unlike some other devices, I was able to actually enjoy some music. If you're using the ThinkPad X1 Carbon on your lap, it's a whole different story. Because the speakers are up front and aim down, the sound becomes muffled and practically unusable. I would recommend switching to headphones if you're using the laptop while sitting on the couch. Performance All of the design, appearance, and features mean nothing if the device can't work as your daily driver. Luckily, the X1 Carbon has great performance to go along with its nice array of features. As with all Ultrabooks, this one is powered by a relatively weak Intel 620 graphics card, so don't expect strong video game performance. However, since the target market for the device is the working professional, that's not surprising. I began by running the X1 Carbon through the PCMark Creative, Work, and Home tests, and the device managed to crush the competition, besting the HP Elite x2 that I reviewed late last year. How much that translates into real world performance is up for debate, but it's clear that the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon can easily run whatever productivity workloads you want to throw at it. If you want to see the raw reports, you can find them here: PCMark Creative Test PCMark Work Test PCMark Home Test On the gaming side, the results were still better than any other laptop I've reviewed, but the difference wasn't as dramatic and again, I doubt most people will be able to notice on most games. The Ice Storm test was the only notable exception, clocking in nearly 40% higher than its nearest competitor. Again, the raw reports can be found here: 3dMark Ice Storm 3dMark Cloud Gate 3dMark Firestrike 3dMark has also released a couple of new benchmarks that I've never run before. Without knowing how previous laptops faired in the test, it's hard to say if these results are good or not, but I'll include them for future reference. On the first test, Time Spy, the X1 Carbon scored 279. The second test, API Overhead, is measured differently. Instead of a single number to represent performance, the test breaks the results down into four categories: DirectX 11 Multi-threaded draw calls per second (518,698), DirectX 11 Single-threaded draw calls per second (483,603), DirectX 12 draw calls per second (2,216,076), and Vulkan draw calls per second (1,594,440). Miscellaneous One of the biggest selling points for the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon over some of its competitors is the security features that it builds in. The fingerprint sensor, for example, is the best I've ever used on a laptop. Unlike cheaper models that make you swipe your finger over the sensor in order to read it, the X1 Carbon lets you simply press your finger on it to unlock your machine. The device also has a dTPM chip, which is the most secure and most expensive implementation of TPM. The chip is dedicated to security, and includes tamper resistance as well. Since services like BitLocker rely on TPM to function, this provides extra peace of mind. In addition, the inclusion of vPro will give enterprises an easier way to manage and control the X1 Carbon. Another great selling point for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the fact that it includes both USB-C and USB-A ports on the same device, something we're starting to see less of on the market. With all of the various USB-A devices (especially thumbdrives) available, it's a good idea to keep these around a little longer. Finally, it looks like Lenovo is keeping bloatware to a minimum on the device. There's a few Lenovo-specific scanning tools to check the health of the system, provide support, and optimize the usage, as well as a Lenovo-specific photo viewer. A couple of standard games, like Candy Crush Soda Saga are included too﻿, but those should probably be removed. Regardless, the desktop was not cluttered with icons, so overall I was impressed with the lack of bloat. Noise and Heat Unlike some other Ultrabooks, the X1 Carbon does have a fan. It's situated on the bottom of the device, but in my testing I found that it rarely ever turned on, except during the video benchmarking tests. Even then, the fan noise was barely perceptible. The device also stayed very cool to the touch during normal daily use. While benchmarking, it felt slightly warm to the touch, but nothing that would be too noticeable in use. Conclusion If you're a fan of Lenovo laptops, you'll absolutely love the refinements and upgrades the company has made to the fifth generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon. The keyboard remains one of the best in the business, and the flexibility to use the TrackPoint or ClickPad to move your cursor, as well as having buttons both above and below the ClickPad itself, make using the device a pleasure. While individuals may not care about some of great security features, such as a quality fingerprint reader, a tamper-resistant TPM chip, and vPro, enterprise buyers will love them. There really are very few things to dislike about the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. While I've grown used to using a touchscreen, not everyone will agree that the lack of this feature is a negative. The function key is where I would expect the Control key to be, but that's an oddity that can be learned. That leaves price as the main negative for the laptop, and though it's expensive, it's not out of line for a high quality, enterprise-ready device. UPDATE: User warwagon asked to see the device with the bottom removed, so I'm adding that image here. The back of the ThinkPad Carbon X1 is held on with five small Phillips head screws and then snaps out. You can tell that the components are not meant to be user replaceable, which is common with Ultrabooks due to the density of the devices.   Tags Review Lenovo Ultrabook X1 carbon X1 Laptop Thinkpad Thinkpad x1 carbon Tpm Dtpm Trackpoint Clickpad Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Follow @TwitterDev Previous Story Yahoo Mail app for Windows 10 shutting down next week; users told to switch to web browser Next Story Speculation of North Korean link to global WannaCry ransomware attack Related Stories Moto G5 review: Nougat on a budget May 9, 2017 · Hot!

The matter was decided jointly by Israel’s Tax Authority, the Department of the Accountant General and the Bank of Israel. Were the taxes to be paid in shekels, Intel would have to sell dollars to buy shekels, which could even further strengthen the shekel. According to estimates, Israel is scheduled to get some $1 billion -$1.5 billion in tax revenues from Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based developer of advanced vision and driver assistance systems. Expectations of the inflow of tax revenue money were already affecting the shekel exchange rate, which fell below NIS 3.6 per dollar on Monday, spurring the Bank of Israel to intervene by buying dollars, according to TheMarker. The strong shekel is hampering Israel’s exports. Separately, the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye said Tuesday they would add Delphi Automotive as a development partner and system integrator for their joint autonomous driving platform. “The four partners intend to jointly deploy a cooperation model to deliver and scale the developed solutions to the broader OEM automotive industry and potentially other industries,” the companies said in a statement. BMW, Intel, Mobileye announce cooperation for driverless car, July 2016 (Courtesy) Delphi has already provided a prototype computer platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion, and high performance automated driving computing, the statement said. In July 2016 BMW Group, Intel, and Mobileye said they would join forces to make self-driving vehicles a reality and would collaborate to bring solutions for “highly and fully automated driving” into series production by 2021. The three original partners have since developed a system that can be used by other automotive developers and carmakers for their own designs and brands, the statement said. The Intel-Mobileye deal The US giant said in March it had entered into an agreement to buy Mobileye in an effort to position itself as a leading technology player in the fast-growing self-driving car market. Following the agreement, an Intel subsidiary put out a tender offer on April 5 for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye at a price of $63.54 per share, deducting applicable withholding taxes and without interest, payable in cash to the shareholders. The tender offer is scheduled to expire on June 21. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions, the company said in the April 5 statement. One of the approvals Mobileye is waiting for, said Elad Brauner, a tax partner at GKH Law Offices in Tel Aviv who is not involved in the deal, is a nod from the Israeli Tax Authority to classify the deal in Israel as a share sale, even if it is classified as an asset sale in The Netherlands where the company was incorporated. To approve the Intel deal, Mobileye needs a 95% approval of shareholders. “This is not easy to get,” said Brauner. To make the deal happen, having the transaction structured as an asset deal in Holland, followed by liquidation of the parent company, will allow the percentage of shareholders who will have to vote for the deal to be reduced, making it easier to pass, he explained. But for tax purposes in Israel, Mobileye prefers the deal to be classified as a share sale. In a share sale, foreign investors are exempt from taxes whereas if the transaction is classified as an asset deal in Israel, the transaction would be taxable. “Although there is no guarantee that a favorable ruling will be obtained and although there are no precedents to such a unique situation, we estimate that a favorable ruling will be given,” said Brauner. “Economically this transaction should be treated as a share deal and there are good arguments to support such treatment also for Israeli tax purposes.” A spokesman for the Tax Authority declined to comment, as did Mobileye, which said, “When we have something to update, we will update the market in the normal way.” Mobileye develops sensors and artificial intelligence that allow a vehicle’s onboard computer to know where it is in relation to other vehicles, pedestrians and the surroundings, the key technologies needed for cars to eventually safely drive themselves. The deal, the largest-ever purchase of an Israeli high-tech company, was hailed across Israel as a sign of the country’s technological prowess.

(Photo: Detroit News file photo) CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Delphi Automotive said Tuesday it will become a systems integrator and partner for BMW Group, Intel Corp. and Mobileye NV’s jointly developed automated vehicle platform. Delphi, which said its agreement with the partners is non-exclusive, will be involved in integrating BMW, Intel and Mobileye’s automated driving solutions into automaker vehicle architectures. The United Kingdom-based supplier with a large employee base in Troy also could provide software and hardware such as sensors and could help customize solutions. BMW, a German automaker, chipmaking company Intel, and Israel-based tech company Mobileye announced last year that they would join together to create a fully automated driving system for production by 2021. The three companies have developed an architecture that could be used by other automakers and mobility companies. “This is a great opportunity for Delphi to use its technical depth and experience in automated driving and electrical architecture to help the cooperation partners develop and deploy at scale,” Kevin Clark, president and CEO of Delphi Automotive, said in a statement. “Our close working relationship with all three partners serves as a solid foundation for a success.” Delphi Chief Technology Officer Glen De Vos said in a call with reporters Tuesday that it won’t be the only systems integrator for the BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnership. He said the partnership intends to have the platform available for other automakers to use who will need other systems integration company support. Kathy Winter, vice president of autonomous driving at Intel, said the project’s self-driving platform is accessible across the auto industry and that scale will help quicken the rollout of autonomous driving. “We want to forward and accelerate the entire industry,” she said. BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in January said they plan to deploy a fleet of 40 autonomous BMW cars by the second half of this year. Intel confirmed Tuesday that the companies are on track to hit that goal. mburden@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2319 Twitter: MBurden_DN CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2qo0uVr TOP VIDEOS Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez By Paul Lienert | DETROIT DETROIT German automaker BMW AG, U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp and parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC on Tuesday said they would collaborate on development of a highly-automated self-driving platform for BMW, with Delphi handling integration of components and software. BMW said the new platform is intended to be sold to other vehicle manufacturers, which in turn may choose their own systems integrators to customize the platform to suit their vehicles. The cost, complexity and accelerated pace of development of self-driving vehicles continue to spark sweeping alliances between automobile manufacturers and suppliers. In April, rival German automaker Daimler AG formed a similar alliance with supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] to speed development of self-driving vehicles. BMW on Tuesday said it expects that over time there will be "a fairly small number" of self-driving platforms shared by most carmakers because of the tremendous costs of integrating hardware, software and data. In April, Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc said it would make its new Apollo self-driving platform available to other companies. On Monday, Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit and ride services startup Lyft Inc announced a self-driving vehicle partnership. Waymo has been shopping its self-driving platform to global automakers and has modest deals with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co Ltd. Delphi will share with the BMW alliance some of the work it has been doing on a separate self-driving platform it is developing with Intel and Mobileye NV, the Israeli vision system and mapping expert that is being acquired by Intel, said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer. Delphi also may provide radar and other sensors to the BMW self-driving platform, which is targeted for production in 2021. BMW, Daimler and Intel jointly own Here, a high-definition mapping service, along with Volkswagen AG and Tencent Holdings Ltd, the Chinese internet giant. Here is positioning itself to be a key supplier of maps for self-driving cars.

Trump Tells Russian Officials Classified Islamic State Intel That Could Jeopardize Source This guy stays running his trap but may be the BIGGEST terror threat to us all… Trump is under fire after U.S. senior officials claim they had to do serious damage control after Agent Orange ran his big trap to Russian officials during a May 10 meeting where he basically BRAGGED to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak about the great intel we get about the Islamic State. According to Washington Post reports: “This is code-word information,” said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” “It is all kind of shocking,” said a former senior U.S. official who is close to current administration officials. “Trump seems to be very reckless and doesn’t grasp the gravity of the things he’s dealing with, especially when it comes to intelligence and national security. And it’s all clouded because of this problem he has with Russia.” In his meeting with Lavrov, Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” the president said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange. The big issues is that Trump was discussing aspects of the threat that our country only knows because of a key partner’s use of certain espionage capabilities. Although Trump didn’t spill about how we get the information he got pretty specific about how the Islamic State was attempting a specific plot and the biggest issue according to officials was that he mentioned the city in the Islamic State where the intelligence partner detected the threat — a detail that wouldn’t be that difficult for Russia to use to try to discover who the partner is and possibly work against them in their attempts to aid Syria. “Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive, and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling,” said a former senior U.S. counterterrorism official who also worked closely with members of the Trump national security team. He and others spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. The White House has already issued denials: “The president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation,” said H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, who participated in the meeting. “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” McMaster reiterated his statement in a subsequent appearance at the White House on Monday and described the Washington Post story as “false,” but did not take any questions. Long story short — the sh**show continues… The Islamic State is a common enemy for the US and Russia but we’re on opposite sides in Syria — with Moscow deploying military assets to support President Bashar al-Assad. “Russia could identify our sources or techniques,” the senior U.S. official said. A former intelligence official who handled high-level intelligence on Russia said that given the clues Trump provided, “I don’t think that it would be that hard [for Russian spy services] to figure this out.” Yikes!!!! He GOTTA GO! NOW!!!!

  Home Topics Archives About Contact  RSS Headlines « UH team develops new, highly efficient and durable OER catalyst for water splitting | Main | Cypress expands long-term collaboration with Bosch Automotive into next-generation ADAS platforms » Print this post BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye bringing Delphi in as partner in autonomous driving platform work 16 May 2017 The BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye will bring Delphi onboard as a development partner and system integrator for the autonomous driving platform currently under development. The common platform is intended to address level 3 to level 5 automated driving and will be made available to multiple car vendors and other industries who could benefit from autonomous machines and deep machine learning. (Earlier post.) The four partners intend to jointly deploy a cooperation model to deliver and scale the developed solutions to the broader OEM automotive industry and potentially other industries. From the very beginning we designed our cooperation on a non-exclusive platform for this technology of the future. With the onboarding of Delphi we significantly strengthen our development of the automated driving and do a future step in spreading this technology across the industry. —Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development Delphi has already provided a prototype compute platform to the BMW Group and is working together with Intel and Mobileye in the areas of perception, sensor fusion, and high performance automated driving computing. In July 2016 BMW Group, Intel, and Mobileye announced that they were joining forces to make self-driving vehicles become a reality and were collaborating to bring solutions for highly and fully automated driving into series production by 2021. The partners have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue advanced designs and create differentiated brands. The partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye continues to break new ground in the auto industry. In less than one year the joint teams have made substantial progress to deliver a scalable platform for autonomous driving and are on path to deliver 40 pilot cars in second half of this year. Adding Delphi as an integration partner will help to accelerate the introduction of autonomous cars on the streets from multiple carmakers and offer differentiation to customers. —Intel CEO Brian Krzanich System integrators, such as Delphi, are needed for the go-to-market strategy of the joint solution to reach multiple automotive OEMs quickly. A key role for Delphi will be the integration of the solution delivered by BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye into OEM vehicle architectures. Additionally, Delphi may also provide required hardware components such as sensors as well as specific customization efforts and applications for differentiation. The engagement between Delphi and the Cooperation Partners is non-exclusive. The Cooperation Partners are in the process of recruiting additional integration and development partners to support future OEM customer needs.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Delphi joins self-driving alliance with BMW, Intel By Reuters Published: 10:03 EDT, 16 May 2017 | Updated: 10:03 EDT, 16 May 2017 e-mail By Paul Lienert DETROIT, May 16 (Reuters) - German automaker BMW AG , U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp and parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC on Tuesday said they would collaborate on development of a highly-automated self-driving platform for BMW, with Delphi handling integration of components and software. BMW said the new platform is intended to be sold to other vehicle manufacturers, which in turn may choose their own systems integrators to customize the platform to suit their vehicles. The cost, complexity and accelerated pace of development of self-driving vehicles continue to spark sweeping alliances between automobile manufacturers and suppliers. In April, rival German automaker Daimler AG formed a similar alliance with supplier Robert Bosch GmbH to speed development of self-driving vehicles. BMW on Tuesday said it expects that over time there will be "a fairly small number" of self-driving platforms shared by most carmakers because of the tremendous costs of integrating hardware, software and data. In April, Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc said it would make its new Apollo self-driving platform available to other companies. On Monday, Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving unit and ride services startup Lyft Inc announced a self-driving vehicle partnership. Waymo has been shopping its self-driving platform to global automakers and has modest deals with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Honda Motor Co Ltd . Delphi will share with the BMW alliance some of the work it has been doing on a separate self-driving platform it is developing with Intel and Mobileye NV, the Israeli vision system and mapping expert that is being acquired by Intel, said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer. Delphi also may provide radar and other sensors to the BMW self-driving platform, which is targeted for production in 2021. BMW, Daimler and Intel jointly own Here, a high-definition mapping service, along with Volkswagen AG and Tencent Holdings Ltd, the Chinese internet giant. Here is positioning itself to be a key supplier of maps for self-driving cars.

(Photo: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 16, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC), a global data storage technology and solutions leader, today announced the HGST-branded Ultrastar® SS300, the company’s highest-performing SAS SSD to date. It is the latest addition to the company’s family of Ultrastar 12Gb/s SAS SSDs, which are used to meet the rigorous data demands of many of the world’s largest companies today. Developed in partnership with Intel, the new Ultrastar SS300 delivers best-in-class random performance, offering speeds of up to 400,000 IOPS random read and up to 200,000 IOPS random write1. “Today, we raise the bar with our newest 12Gb/s SAS SSD, the Ultrastar SS300,” said Ulrich Hansen, vice president of SSD product marketing at Western Digital. “Built with high-endurance 3D NAND flash memory, the Ultrastar SS300 offers best-in-class speed, outstanding capacity and intelligent power options that enable customers to tailor storage systems and server solutions that are just right for their demanding needs. These benefits are delivered with the same tremendous reliability that has helped to make Ultrastar 12Gb/s SAS SSDs popular around the globe.” The Ultrastar SS300 is ideal for the intensive data demands of virtualized storage systems, databases and private and hybrid cloud environments. It offers capacities up to 7.68TB, giving data center architects the potential to reduce the number of drives, consolidate servers and open up valuable rack space. The new Ultrastar SS300 is offered in a variety of endurance classes and comes with a range of features and power settings. This includes a 14-watt power envelope that can unlock additional performance capabilities and an ultra-low power setting for more efficient energy consumption. With this variety of options and high capacity, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have a greater flexibility to create next-generation data center storage systems that address a wide variety of workloads and total cost of ownership (TCO) requirements. “The use of Intel technology in the Ultrastar SS300 12Gb/s SAS SSD complements Western Digital’s commitment to offering exceptional solutions to meet their customers’ needs,” said Bill Leszinske, vice president of strategic planning, marketing and business development at Intel Corporation. “Our long-standing relationship with Western Digital to develop SAS SSDs has been very productive, providing leadership solutions for the storage community worldwide.” Additional Ultrastar SS300 12Gb/s SAS SSD features and specifications include: Sequential read and write speeds of up to 2050 MB/s2 Four endurance choices, from 0.5 to 10 drive writes per day Offers a choice of security options, including Instant Secure Erase (ISE), Self-Encrypting Drive (SED)-compliant with TCG Enterprise and SED-compliant with TCG Enterprise with FIPS 140-2 certification The Ultrastar SS300 SSD is currently shipping to OEM partners. It joins Western Digital’s broad range of HGST-brand and SanDisk-brand enterprise grade storage solutions, which includes innovative helium enterprise hard disk drives as well as SAS, NVMe™ and SATA SSD solutions. Additional product information can be found in the Ultrastar SS300 SAS SSD datasheet. Industry Perspective: “With the increasing volume and velocity of data being generated every day, we felt it was crucial to partner with a trusted leader in the SAS SSD market. This is why Oracle chose the HGST-brand Ultrastar SS300 SAS SSD to deliver next-generation hybrid and all-flash solutions for the data center. Not only has the Ultrastar SS300 significantly improved performance consistency and quality of service (QoS), but the capacity increase also enabled a reduction in TCO.” – Ofer Michael, senior vice president, Storage, Oracle “SAS SSD adoption continues to see strong growth across a variety of critical enterprise applications.

It's the latest in a flurry of partnerships between automakers, tech companies, parts suppliers and ride-hailing services as they race to build robot-controlled vehicles. The companies announced Tuesday that Delphi will help to integrate autonomous driving systems. BMW, Intel and Mobileye joined forces in July of 2016. They plan to start producing automated vehicle systems by 2021, and BMW plans to have an autonomous vehicle on the road by then. It would be capable of driving itself, but a human driver could still be called on to intervene. FILE - In this March 22, 2006, file photo, Delphi's World Headquarters is shown in Troy, Mich. Automotive parts and electronics maker Delphi Corp. is the latest partner to join BMW, Intel and Mobileye to develop autonomous vehicles. The companies announced Tuesday, May 16, 2017, that Delphi will work with the companies to integrate autonomous driving systems. They plan to have a self-driving system ready by 2021. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) The companies say Delphi, with U.S. operations based in suburban Detroit, already has provided a prototype computing platform that melds sensors, artificial intelligence and other computers. The system won't go into just BMWs, though. The companies plan to develop a system that can be used by other automakers or tech companies in their own cars. The partners will decide each company's role in the partnership, as well as the financial arrangements, in coming months. More partners could be added to the group, including other automakers. Delphi would be in charge of integrating the system into other automakers' vehicles. During a conference call with reporters to discuss the partnership, executives from the four companies said alliances like theirs will become more common in the future as partners try to share costs and expertise. Richard Rau, BMW AG's vice president of sensors, control units and software, said his company believes autonomous driving platforms will be consolidated over time as more companies join forces. "In the long run there will be only a few platforms left," he said. Delphi now produces electrical wiring architecture, computing platforms and autonomous driving software. Mobileye, of Israel, makes software that integrates cameras, radar and other sensors and offers artificial intelligence and mapping. Intel has computing hardware and data centers and mapping that will help cars make decisions, while BMW makes autos and has its own autonomous car technology. Such partnerships seem to be announced almost every day as companies frenetically race to be first with the new technology that has the potential to reduce crashes, save lives and change how we all get around. In the past two months, auto software and parts maker Bosch announced it was joining with Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz, to work on autonomous cars. Toyota teamed with artificial intelligence company NVIDIA and Waymo, formerly Google's autonomous car division, partnered with ride-hailing service Lyft. In March, Intel Corp. announced it will spend more than $15 billion to acquire Mobileye NV. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

We look at the best devices in the market   Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar Lenovo Legion Y720. While the PC market has been shrinking overall, PC gaming has been growing. According to numbers released in January by Jon Peddie Research, a consultancy firm, the worldwide PC gaming market exceeded $30 billion (around Rs1.9 trillion) in 2016 and is expected to grow at a 6% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through to the year 2019. The study attributes this to an entrenched PC gaming culture, and the absence of significant console traction in the Asia-Pacific region. India is one of the fastest growing markets in the entry-level (sub-$1,000) gaming segment, while North America and Western Europe lead in the high-end segment (over $1,800). PCs are no longer the bulky rigs they used to be a few years ago; both PCs and laptops are more powerful today, with better graphics and components . Here are some of the best Windows 10-based gaming laptops and desktops. Lenovo Ideacentre Y710 Cube PC Lenovo Ideacentre Y710 Cube PC’s design is inspired by a spaceship. $1,299 (around Rs83,135) This gaming desktop’s design is inspired by a spaceship. With a red and black colour scheme, it is quite compact— but don’t let the size fool you. It weighs 7.4kg. At its heart is Intel’s 3.4 GHz 6th Generation Core i7 6700 chip with 16 GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8 GB) graphics. It has 256 GB SSD and 2 TB HDD. It supports 4K resolution for TVs and monitors, and is powerful enough for VR gaming. Asus ROG G501VW Asus ROG G501VW’s biggest draw is the 15.6-inch 4K display (3,840x2,160p). Rs99,990 At 20.6mm and 2.06kg, the Asus ROG G501VW is one of the slimmest and lightest gaming notebooks we have come across. For a slim notebook, its vitals are pretty powerful. It has Intel’s 6th Generation Core i7 6700 processor with 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 960M (4 GB) graphics and 512 GB SSD. Its biggest draw is the 15.6-inch 4K display (3,840x2,160p), a rarity at this price point. Asus has used two independent fans and copper heat sinks to keep the device cool under stress. Lenovo Legion Y720 Lenovo Legion Y720 offers 128 GB SSD to boot-up apps faster and 1 TB for your game and other files. $1,119 The Legion Y720 belongs to Lenovo’s new breed of powerful gaming notebooks. It is driven by the powerful Intel 7th Generation Core i7 7700 processor with 8 GB RAM and Nvidia GeForce 1060M (6 GB) graphics. It offers 128 GB SSD to boot-up apps faster and 1 TB for your game and other files. The two JBL speakers are placed on either side of the hinges.

(Photo: Delphi Automotive PLC) 28 CONNECTTWEET 184 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE German automaker BMW Group and U.S. tech giant Intel strengthened their self-driving car alliance with the addition of auto supplier Delphi, putting the companies a step closer to their goal of delivering an autonomous car by 2021. BMW and Intel said Tuesday that they had struck a deal to collaborate with Delphi on development and integration of self-driving car technology, with a particular emphasis "in the areas of perception, sensor fusion and high performance automated driving computing." Richard Rau, BMW's vice president of sensors, control units and software, also told reporters that the company is in "very deep discussions" to add other automakers to the alliance, possibly "within a few weeks." The alliance reflects a further escalation in the arms race among automakers, tech companies and suppliers to assemble partnerships to meet the intense technological, logistical and financial demands of autonomous vehicle development. The latest deal is not exclusive, meaning Delphi can collaborate with others. Delphi's expertise in data analysis and electrical architecture are viewed as critical to the development of autonomous cars. One unique element of the BMW-Intel partnership is its plans to offer its technology to other companies, presumably under licensing deals or some other lucrative financial arrangement. Executives declined to comment on the financials. "This is not just a platform for BMW — it’s a platform for the market, and that’s a truly unique aspect to what’s being done here," Delphi Chief Technology Officer Glen De Vos told reporters. The alliance comes after Delphi recently announced plans to split into two companies, with one focused on electrical systems for self-driving cars and the second focused on powertrains. But after Intel recently announced plans to acquire self-driving car tech powerhouse Mobileye for $15 billion, the BMW-Intel-Delphi alliance can make a case for industry leadership. Others that are collaborating include​ German automaker Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and auto supplier Bosch, Detroit automaker General Motors and ride-hailing app Lyft, and former Google driverless car project Waymo and Lyft.

Intel agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion in March in a deal which, if completed, is expected to result in a capital gains tax payment of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Israel had initially believed the money would fund tax cuts, but the central bank was worried converting such a large sum from dollars would further strengthen the shekel, which Bank of Israel officials have said is “over-valued.” The Israel Tax Authority, accountant general and Bank of Israel said in Tuesday’s joint statement that Intel will be able to pay the taxes derived from the Mobileye transaction in U.S. dollars “with the aim of preventing an impact on the exchange rate and over-appreciation of the shekel.” The shekel has gained 7 percent against the dollar so far in 2017 to a 27-month high of 3.6. It is also close to a 15-year peak versus the euro and at an all-time high against a basket of currencies.

Intel agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion in March in a deal which, if completed, is expected to result in a capital gains tax payment of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Israel had initially believed the money would fund tax cuts, but the central bank was worried converting such a large sum from dollars would further strengthen the shekel, which Bank of Israel officials have said is "over-valued". The Israel Tax Authority, accountant general and Bank of Israel said in Tuesday's joint statement that Intel will be able to pay the taxes derived from the Mobileye transaction in U.S. dollars "with the aim of preventing an impact on the exchange rate and over-appreciation of the shekel". Any taxes paid from the deal could then either be deposited at the Bank of Israel as foreign exchange reserves or spent abroad by Israel on arms or other items. The shekel has gained 7 percent against the dollar so far in 2017 to a 27-month high of 3.6. It is also close to a 15-year peak versus the euro and at an all-time high against a basket of currencies. The Bank of Israel has tried to halt the appreciation through market intervention and its foreign exchange reserves hit a record high of $105.1 billion in April.

Read the latest rumours about Skylake X release date and specs. A quartet of high-performance chips is coming, including a 12-core monster By Jim Martin | 16 May 17 Skylake release date, price and specifications Skylake is the codename for Intel's sixth-generation range of Core laptop and desktop PC processors. They've already been superseded by the seventh-gen CPUs and you can find out how Skylake compares with Kaby Lake. But Skylake isn't dead yet. No. Still to come are the Skylake X CPUs, which are the high-end enthusiast versions. And thanks to a leak on a tech forum, we may now know the specs of those chips. Interestingly, it appears that Intel won't use the Core i7 branding as it has done in previous years but add a new number: 9. The Core i9 range could be in response to AMD's Ryzen processors, which were named to seem similar to Intel's Core i5 and i7 ranges.  Rather than cut profit margins and compete on price, Intel might be trying to position the new chips as 'better than Ryzen 7' by using a higher number. There's no word on pricing yet, but we'll update this article when details are announced - or leaked. When is the Skylake X release date? Expected release date: 30 May 2017 A report by Hot Hardware says that the chips will be announced at Computex at the end of the month. However, the flagship of the range may not be officially unveiled until August, possibly at Gamescom. A leak, via Anandtech forum user Sweepr, says the chips will launch in June. A third report, by DigiTimes, has previously predicted a Computex launch for both Skylake X and Kaby Lake X, along with the X299 chipset which the chips will use. Originally, Skylake processors (including the Core i7-6600K and Core i7-6700K) went on sale on 5 August 2015, and the locked-multiplie desktop chips launched at the start of September 2015. What are the Core i9 models and specifications? shows that we can expect at least three new chips in a couple of weeks, and then a flagship model - the Core i9-7920X - in a few months. That's why there's no information on clock speeds.   Core i9-7920X Core i9-7900X Core i9-7820X Core i9-7800X Cores / Threads 12 / 24 10 / 20 8 / 16 6 / 12 L3 Cache 16.5MB 13.75MB 11MB 8.25MB PCIe lanes 44 44 28 28 Base clock TBC 3.3GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz Turbo 2.0 TBC 4.3GHz 4.3GHz 4.0GHz Turbo 3.0 TBC 4.5GHz 4.5GHz N/A TDP 140W 140W 140W 140W The processors will required a motherboard with the LGA 2066 Socket and the forthcoming X299 chipset, which is part of the Basin Falls platform. They have 1MB of L2 Cache, which is four times as much as the Core i7-7700K. They'll support quad-channel DDR4-2666 and support AVX-512 instruction, though the latter is unconfirmed. Here are the key specs for the original Skylake desktop processors, which you can buy from Amazon: Core i5-6400 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 2.7GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 950MHz 65W Price: £149.99 inc VAT Core i5-6500 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.2GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 11050MHz 65W TDP Price: £159.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.3GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1050MHz 65W TDP Price: £179.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600K Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.5GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £199.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.4GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £244.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700K Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 4.0GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £263.99 inc VAT What are Skylake's features and chipsets? When it launched, one of the reasons to buy a PC with a Skylake chip was the sheer number of new features it brought. Rather than being a simple performance bump, Skylake was first to support DDR4 memory. Skylake arrived with the '100-series' chipset, codenamed Sunrise Point. The Z170 Express replaced the Z97, which itself was not a massive upgrade from Z87. The chipset supports up to 20 PCI Express 3.0 lanes, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports and 14 USB 2.0 ports. Motherboards with the Z170 Express chipset can have up to six SATA ports and an eSATA channel, plus Intel's Rapid Storage Technology for PCIe storage devices including NVMe. The Core i7 chips have 16 PCI Express 3.0 lanes for graphics which can be split into 1x 16-lane, 2x 8-lane or 1x 8-lane and 2x 4-lane channels. The memory controller supports dual-channel DDR4 or DDR3L DRAM, and they use Socket 1151. The H170 chipset replaced the H97 for mainstream PCs, while the H110 is the 'value' offering, replacing the H81 and various other chipsets. Overclocking The K versions of Skylake are multiplier unlocked. Interestingly, the base clock is separate from the PCI-E bus. This means you can adjust the core clock frequency of the chip without affecting anything else. However, overclockers will still change the multiplier and voltage to see the biggest performance gains, so there's not much change overall.

Click here to see suggestions from google Entertainment Light as air Three great Ultrabooks you can buy in Nepal - Anuj Bhandari May 16, 2017- Ultrabooks—high end laptops that are sleek in design and uncompromising in performance—are trending these days. The portability and functionality that these laptops provide are second to none. Of late, distributors and sellers have been scrambling to introduce the top of the line laptops in Nepal.  Here are three laptops available in the Nepali market that meets the demand for top-notch features.  ASUS Zenbook 3 Lightest of the bunch, the ASUS Zenbook 3 weighs just 910 grams. It has some top of the line specifications and the fact that it weighs so little is not just a gimmick. The ultrathin ultrabook has a 12.5-inch full HD IPS display which wears a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 outside for that extra protection against drops and scratches. The viewing angle of the device is great at 178° and the display has the contrast ratio of 1,000:1. Unlike other two devices in this list, the ASUS Zenbook 3 is only available in the Intel core i7 version in Nepal. The dual core Kaby Lake processor has a clock speed of 3.5 GHz with turbo boost. This processor is paired with 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM and Intel HD Graphics 620. So, the ultrabook isn’t much of a gaming laptop. It can, however, breeze through your other day-to-day activities like a champ. As far as the storage is concerned, the ASUS Zenbook 3 available in Nepal comes with 512GB of SSD memory. Because of its smaller body, the device only features a couple of ports. One of its sides includes a headphone jack and the other side is engraved with USB Type-C connector. An adapter does come with the laptop but you’ll have to buy a lot of dongles just to connect a mere flash drive to the ultrabook if you were to lose it. The Zenbook 3 has teamed up with Harman Kardon for the ASUS SonicMaster audio technology which when paired with four speakers, produces a great sound. Talking about its connectivity, the device has Wi-Fi AC allowing top notch wireless performance. Unfortunately, one of the worst features of the ultrabook has to be its webcam which is only of VGA quality.  Under the hood, there is a six-cell 40 Wh Polymer battery on the Zenbook 3. This battery, according to ASUS, can run the laptop for nine hours. I really liked the fact that ASUS opted for a fast battery charging capability. Customers will be able to go from zero to 60 percent in just 49 minutes.  As for the pricing, Nagmani International is currently offering a discount on the pricing of the ASUS Zenbook 3 and it is available at Rs 198,500. ASUS Zenbook 3 • 12.5-inch IPS full HD display • Intel core i7-7500U Kaby Lake processor • Up to 3.5 GHz Turbo boost • Intel HD Graphics 620 • 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD ROM • Fingerprint reader • 40 Wh battery • Price: Rs 198,500 (available at nagmani.com)   Dell XPS 13 9360 The Dell XPS 13 9360 stands out with an Infinity Edge display. The 13.3-inch screen is fit into an 11-inch frame making the device look smaller for its size. The almost bezel-less design is attractive and will catch a few eyes in public. The display comes in full HD quality and the matte panel helps even in an awkward viewing angle.  While it is not as thin and light as its competitors, the Dell XPS 13 is by no means a compromise. The non-touch version weighs just around 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg) and is 15.24 mm thick. And unlike typical ultrabooks, the lid feels sturdy and the keyboard doesn’t flex much.  Among the underrated features of the Dell XPS 13 is its audio. The ultrabook has two stereo speakers on either side which when paired with MaxxAudioPro, produces great audio.  Powering the Dell XPS 13 is the 7th-generation Intel Core i5-7200U Kaby Lake processor with dual cores. This is aided by 8GB of RAM and Intel HD Graphics 620. Safe to say, the XPS 13 isn’t made for gaming purposes.  In terms of storage, ITTI Nepal only sells the 256GB SSD version of the Core i5 Kaby Lake processor. Since it features an SD card slot, you don’t have to worry about running out of storage. The Dell XPS 13 also has dual USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, Thunderbolt 3 port and a slot for security lock.  The ultrabook runs on a 60 Wh battery, arguably one of the best in its price range. It will last for around 10 hours or more if you use it just for internet browsing and writing documents. However, the absence of fast battery charging option is a pain and it takes me two hours and 30 minutes to three hours just to juice up the battery. Even though the Dell XPS 13 9360 is an amazing ultrabook, it still has some flaws. The webcam in the device is placed in the bottom left corner because of the thin bezel above the display. This odd placement results in an awkward ‘chin-angled’ videos. The key travel of the device is a bit less than its competitors but the inclusion of the back-lit keyboard definitely helps in a dark environment.  ITTI Nepal is currently selling the Intel Core i5-7200U variant of the Dell XPS 13 9360 at Rs 139,999. Dell XPS 13 9360  •    13.3-inch full HD display •    Intel core i5-7200U Kaby Lake processor •    Intel HD Graphics 620 •    8GB RAM, 256GB SSD ROM •    60 Wh battery •    Price: Rs 140,000  (available at itti.com.np) MacBook Pro with Touch Bar The MacBook Pro was launched in October last year and made headlines for giving up all other ports and keeping just two Thunderbolt 3 ports on each side. While Thunderbolt 3 may be the future of technology, the lack of USB ports is a turn off for a lot of people including me. It would have been a lot easier if Apple had included an adapter like ASUS did in the Zenbook 3. The MacBook pro has a 13-inch Retina display with the resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels that Apple claims is 67 percent brighter than before. It is powered by 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Sky Lake processor along with Intel Iris Graphics 550 and 8GB RAM. Buyers will get 256GB of SSD storage in this variant.  One of the major features of the MacBook Pro, according to Apple, is the inclusion of a Touch Bar—an OLED Retina display located above the keyboard. The Touch Bar replaces typical function keys with a touch-enabled display panel. The Touch Bar lets users use different commands and actions according to the app they are navigating.  The butterfly keyboard offers 0.5 mm of key travel and is tactile. The speakers of the MacBook Pro have also garnered praises. The 13-inch variant of the device houses a 49.2 Wh polymer battery, which according to Apple can offer up to 10 hours of battery life. Oliz Store is currently selling this device at Rs 231,000. MacBook Pro with touchbar  •    13-inch display (2560 x 1600 pixels) •    Intel core i5 processor •    Up to 3.3 GHz Turbo boost •    Intel Iris Graphics 550 •    8GB RAM, 256GB SSD ROM •    Touch ID, Touch Bar •    49.2 Wh battery •    Price: Rs. 231,000 (available at olizstore.com) Published: 16-05-2017 13:40 The Kathmandu Post ›Entertainment › Anuj Bhandari Next Story Telling the dancers from the dance › User's Feedback Click here for your comments Comment via Facebook Don't have facebook account?

Days after reports of AMD releasing HEDT processors in June, a new report came out, this time for Intel. According to the rumors, Intel is planning on unveiling new Core i9 Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X HEDT processors sometime in June. In an article from Apple Insider, a leaker who goes by the handle “Sweepr” claims that Intel is preparing a presentation for the announcement of its new Core i9 platform. The new processors will feature a minimum of six cores and will go all the way up to 12 cores. The top-tier models will be the i9-7920X and the i9-7900X, each will have 12 and 10 cores, respectively. The second range of models will have six and eight cores in the i9-7800 product line. The i9-7820X will carry the eight core configuration while the i9-7800X will be the six core version. Alleged Core i9 lineup (via overclockers.ru) The 7900 series will offer as much as 16.5MB of L3 cache as well as 44 PCIe lanes. On the other hand, the 7800 series will only be able to support a maximum of 28 PCIe lanes and 11MB of L3 cache. The new HEDT platform will have a base clock of around 3.3GHz and a boost clock of 4.3GHz. Some models will be equipped with Intel’s Turbo Boost 3.0 that will bring the boost clock to as much as 4.5GHz. It is said that the processors, apart from the i9-7920X will be unveiled in June. Meanwhile, the i9-7920X will be unveiled sometime in August. For now, there are no indications about the pricing for the new Core i9 platform. However, consumers can expect that these processors will not come cheap. The current Broadwell-E i7-6950X ten-core processor costs around $1,800 on retail. Consumers should expect the new Core i9 processors to be price somewhere north of that. Another thing left to uncertainty is the idea of Apple using the said chip on the upcoming iMac and Mac Pro refreshes.

This chip was benchmarked against Intel's 10C/20T offering in the Core i9-7900X with its 3.3/4.0GHz base/boost clocks with 13.75MB of L3 cache, and the same PCIe lanes and TDP.     I put all of the scores into one of our benchmark templates, so you can see the scores in a much easier to understand way. As you can see the Core i9-7920X really is a monster, with the multi-core test score pushing 1760, leaving the Core i7-6950X in its rear view mirror, and the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X in its dust.   Even the 10C/20T chip in the Core i9-7900X doesn't do too well, with less performance than the current-gen Core i7-6950X @ 3.5GHz. The 7900X might be at its base 3.3GHz frequency, and the 7920X at 3.3GHz, which would explain these scores. The full 4.5GHz clocks on these Core i9 beasts might be scary good.   NEWS SOURCES:Eteknix.com >> NEXT STORY: RTG boss uses JFK quote for AMD Radeon RX Vega tease << PREVIOUS STORY: Hackers obtain upcoming 'Pirates of the Carribbean' film Related Tags Intel Intel Core i9 Core i9 benchmark Core i9-7920X AMD Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts 'Power Rangers' reboot all but dead after China failure SK Hynix's GDDR6 at 14Gbps offers up to 672GB/sec AMD releases its Radeon RX 560, priced at just $99 The new 'Emoji Movie' trailer is a horrifying spectacle AMD teases Navi on 7nm, next-gen GPU on 7nm in 2020View More News Posts Forum Activity Brand new Z97 Killer Fatal1ty no POST, led for a second then off Drobo 5N2 Five-Bay NAS Review Computer suddenly Freezes MSI GS63VR STEALTH PRO 4K Gaming Laptop Review Gigabyte M8000X software buggedView More Forum Posts Press Releases Micron accelerates all-flash storage speed, performance and value with new flexible petabyte-scale enterprise data center solution Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 and 630 mobile platforms drive advanced photography, enhanced gaming, integrated connectivity and machine learning Toshiba demonstrates latest 64-layer BiCS Flash on client NVM Express M.2 SSD at Dell EMC World ASUS announces two Cerberus gaming peripherals ASUS Republic of Gamers announces Strix Magnus microphoneView More Press Releases Home Sitemap Advertising Awards About Contact Price Search RSS FEEDS PRIVACY POLICY & AD CHOICES © 1999-2017 Tweak Town Pty Ltd.

But it's not over yet: Intel has a new line of CPUs of their own, starting with Skylake-X in June this year. It all started with this image, which has flown around enthusiast forums and sites like wildfire over the last 24 hours: Image: Anandtech Forums It's taken from what appears to be a manufacturing presentation outlining Intel's Skylake-X series of CPUs. The most important element is that it takes away one of the main advantages AMD has with Ryzen right now: the i9 series starts with the hexacore/12 threaded i9-7800X, and goes all the way up to a 12 core/24 threaded i9-7920X, which will presumably settle into the same territory that the Broadwell-E/Haswell-E CPUs have done. For those focusing on more affordable gaming rigs, major changes include a bump in the available L2 cache to 1MB per core. The i7-7740K will become the new i7-7700K more or less, but from there every CPU will have 6 cores or more. Here's the rumoured specs from the deck above: Core i9-7920X 12C/24T 16.5MB L3 44 PCIe lanes Core i9-7900X 10C/20T 13.75MB L3 44 PCIe Lanes 3.3Ghz Base, 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0, 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0 Core i9-7820X 8C/16T 11MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.6Ghz Base, 4.3Ghz Turbo 2.0, 4.5Ghz Turbo 3.0 Core i9-7800X 6C/12T 8.25MB L3 28 PCIe Lanes 3.5Ghz Base, 4.0Ghz Turbo 2.0 Core i7-7740K 4C/8T 8MB L3 16 PCIe Lanes 4.3Ghz Base, 4.5Ghz Turbo 2.0 Clock speeds for the i9-7920X haven't been leaked or revealed, and the chip supposedly won't be out until August anyway. As an added note, it's worth noting that all of this is rumoured at this point. That said, benchmarks have started to appear online. Earlier this morning, a listing surfaced on the SiSoftware benchmarking database featuring an Intel 6 core/12 threaded CPU running off the Basin Falls platform, which is expected to power Intel's Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs: Image: SiSoftware In short, you can expect Intel to pitch the i9-7820X against the Ryzen 7 1800X, the i9-7800X against the Ryzen 7 1700X, and the i7-7740K against the Ryzen 5 CPUs for the gaming enthusiast crowd. The rumoured leak adds that Skylake-X chips will also support DDR4-2666MHz memory, which isn't much of a surprise given that we're in 2017. It will be nice to see a 12 core CPU in 2017, but the reality is the 6 core or 8 core will be the most affordable and logical options for most gamers and consumers. We'll find out more about the CPUs in the coming months: Intel might have cancelled their annual developer forum for this year, but they've overtaken AMD as the sponsor of the PC Gaming Show at E3, and there's always Computex later this month. And as always, as soon as we know local pricing we'll pass the word along. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments nightcabbage @nightcabbage May 16, 2017, 11:59am All well and good to have more cores, however the clock speeds are slower, so single thread performance (including games) will actually be slower on these (than a 7700K, for example)... Same as the Ryzen CPUs... Great for video encoding and stuff though... Reply 2 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR May 16, 2017, 12:05pm Was the same case with Broadwell-E etc. versus the Skylake/Kaby Lake enthusiast CPUs as well. Reply 0 Camm @camm May 16, 2017, 12:42pm What will be interesting is more on AMD's side. Intel has the problem that as core counts increase, more silicon space (and thus also power) must be used in order to maintain cache coherency. AMD with its core complex design only maintains coherency between 4 cores, and copies out cache data cross fabric when needed. Whilst the fabric approach is slower from a cache access perspective, a tonne less silicon is used maintaining that coherency, so clockspeeds may be as high as any other current Ryzen part. Also, I can't see Intel pricing these aggressively enough again threadripper in the first place. Reply 0 sielinth @sielinth May 16, 2017, 12:46pm so I9, I7, I5 and I3? seems overly complicated, especially when you start throwing in mobile cpu (is that still a thing?) Reply 0 OzHuski Guest May 16, 2017, 3:22pm This isn't compatible with the current boards - people need to be aware they will have to upgrade to the new rumoured "X299" platform and intel won't cut costs - this thing will be expensive as hell as they won't canablise their pricing. And there is no "affordable" option even for the i7 compatible variant - you will still be paying for a brand new high end enthusiast board. The Ryzen 9's have also rumoured to leak with 16, 14, 12 and 10 core models and will much like the current lineup - probably be under half what intel is asking for, while adding in quad channel memory support and decent speeds. Its in everyone's best interest right now to wait - but there is a lot more interestin AMD camps CPUs right no due to cost alone. But let's face it, these are overpriced for gaming alone - if that's all your doing, get a R5 1600/R7 1700 or i7 7700 as that's still your best pics for pre gaming. Reply 0 OzHuski Guest May 17, 2017, 9:32am Well Intel might be late to the party - Ryzen Threadripper just got confirmed as a 16core/32thread part for unveiling at computex. If AMD continues there aggressive pricing there will be no reason to consider an i9. i5 is already considered by gamers as being dead with only the i7 withstanding due to its sheer overclock performance.

Dubbed 'Threadripper' this new line of CPUs is aimed at "targeting the world’s fastest ultra-premium desktop systems." With 16 cores and 32 threads, these processors will be AMD's offering in the high-end desktop market and are likely to compete with the Core i9 series that Intel is rumoured to launch later this year. By comparison, the leaked details regarding the Core i9 series suggest 12 cores and 24 threads, though the disparity may not necessarily mean better performance from AMD as Intel has for quite a while held the upper hand in performance per core. While not much is known about the architecture of this upcoming lineup beyond the number of cores, they are expected to be released sometime in the summer this year, which means more details should soon follow at Computex 2017 later this month. It is also believed that the Threadripper series may launch under the Ryzen R9 branding, a step above the Ryzen R7, which is currently at the head of AMD's desktop offerings for consumers.

Dubbed 'Threadripper' this new line of CPUs is aimed at "targeting the world’s fastest ultra-premium desktop systems." With 16 cores and 32 threads, these processors will be AMD's offering in the high-end desktop market and are likely to compete with the Core i9 series that Intel is rumoured to launch later this year. By comparison, the leaked details regarding the Core i9 series suggest 12 cores and 24 threads, though the disparity may not necessarily mean better performance from AMD as Intel has for quite a while held the upper hand in performance per core. While not much is known about the architecture of this upcoming lineup beyond the number of cores, they are expected to be released sometime in the summer this year, which means more details should soon follow at Computex 2017 later this month. It is also believed that the Threadripper series may launch under the Ryzen R9 branding, a step above the Ryzen R7, which is currently at the head of AMD's desktop offerings for consumers. As can be expected from a line of processors aimed at enthusiasts, pricing is likely to be rather high. With both AMD and Intel gearing up for a showdown in the high-end of the CPU market, the battle between Team Red and Team Blue should be more exciting than ever before, with AMD putting in a strong showing for not just being the price leader but possibly also one-upping Intel in the performance department.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Novartis Foundation and Partners Launch Initiative to Tackle Hypertension and Its Root Causes in Low-Income Urban Communities Better Hearts Better Cities is an initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension SOURCE: Novartis DESCRIPTION: Better Hearts Better Cities is a Novartis Foundation initiative to improve cardiovascular health in low-income urban communities by addressing the prevention, management and control of hypertension. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular disease, are a growing health crisis with 75% of NCD deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries; this is compounded by rapid urbanization. The innovative approach is being tested on three continents: in Mongolia, Senegal, and Brazil. Better Hearts Better Cities brings together multisector partners, including a technology advisor partnership with Intel Corporation, to co-design and implement interventions beyond healthcare. BASEL, Switzerland, May 17, 2017 /3BL Media/ – On World Hypertension Day 2017, the Novartis Foundation and its partners, including Intel Corporation, the NCD Alliance, city governments and local partners, announce the launch of Better Hearts Better Cities, an innovative initiative to address the high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension) in low-income urban communities. Rapid urbanization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has deepened health inequities and increased pressure on already under-resourced urban infrastructures and services. This is critical in LMICs which face a growing health crisis of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, with almost 75% of the global NCD deaths occurring in LMICs.1 The Novartis Foundation is taking ambitious steps to tackle hypertension, the prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in low-income urban communities. Better Hearts Better Cities convenes multisector partners – from food suppliers to health authorities, employers and city planners – to contribute expertise and resources for local solutions that improve cardiovascular health in cities. The innovative approach is being tested in three cities, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Dakar, Senegal, and a city in Brazil to be announced later this year. “To thrive, cities must become ecosystems of health and wellbeing, where each part works toward the same goal of improving people’s quality of life. No single actor can tackle hypertension alone and multisector innovation is needed. This is the driving force behind Better Hearts Better Cities. We plan to create a network of partners to co-design, implement and evaluate interventions that strengthen urban health systems while seeking to innovate the way prevention and care is provided,” said Ann Aerts, Head of the Novartis Foundation. “Cities in LMICs can be made healthier places only through close collaboration, with clear benefits to be gained by employers, governments and communities alike in taking joint action to support a healthy workforce” said Katie Dain, Executive Director of the NCD Alliance, the initiative’s global NCD advocacy and workplace partner. “Our priority is to strengthen NCD prevention and control by uniting and strengthening the civil society networks in low-income urban areas to stimulate advocacy, action and accountability.” Information and communication technology (ICT), or digital technology, is an integral part of Better Hearts Better Cities. Intel Corporation, as digital advisor for this initiative, provides in-kind support by performing ICT assessments in the three cities. Intel plans to utilize the insights together with the other partners to design a more sustainable health system that incorporates next generation technology infrastructure alongside improvements in care delivery. “The affordability constraints and lack of existing healthcare infrastructure in LMICs  actually represent a great opportunity to leapfrog over mature markets, because we can bypass costly development stages that are just not realistic there,” said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager, Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. “We’re excited to apply our technology expertise and collaborate on novel approaches that help deliver care at significantly lower costs while improving access and increasing quality.” Progress in Ulaanbaatar Implementation of the initiative is most advanced in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia and home to half of the country’s population, around 1.4 million people.2 In this capital city, also one of the world’s most polluted cities,3 more than 25% of the population suffer from hypertension4 and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for over 40% of the annual deaths.5 Better Hearts Better Cities partners, including Onom Foundation, Ulaanbaatar City Municipal Government and Health Department, National Insurance Fund and the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce, seek to address determining factors such as high salt consumption and poor diet,6 and are co-developing and implementing a first wave of interventions to improve quality and efficiency of care as well as health literacy. About the Novartis Foundation The Novartis Foundation is a philanthropic organization which strives to have sustainable impact on the health of low-income communities through a combination of programmatic work, health outcomes research, and its translation into policy to tackle global health challenges. We work hand-in-hand with local and global partners to catalyze sustainable healthcare models to improve access and health outcomes, and to accelerate efforts to eliminate leprosy and malaria by focusing on interventions that aim to interrupt transmission. Everything we do is grounded in evidence and innovation, and our work is a continuous cycle of evaluation, adaptation and application. In 2016, the operational budget for the Foundation was CHF 15 million and our programs reached 8.9 million people.

The company is expected to announce an upgraded version Macbook Pro and the 12-inch Macbook with faster processors. As per the report, the MacBook Pro will be powered by a faster Kaby Lake Intel processor while the upgraded 12-inch MacBook will also come with a faster Intel chip. Moreover, it is said that Apple might also consider updating the 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor owing to stronger laptop sales. With new laptops in the works, Apple is all set to compete again with rival Microsoft who recently announced the Surface laptop with touchscreen. “The planned upgrades wouldn’t mark a major step forward for Apple’s notebook lineup, but they will demonstrate the company’s dedication to a product that has been criticized by the Mac faithful over the past few years”, said the report. Apple has not launched new hardware for a long time at WWDC and it will be interesting to see what company has to offer. Last year in October, the company had launched new MacBook Pros with a touchscreen integrated into the keyboard. WWDC 2017 is scheduled to take place from June 5th to June 9th.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is an Apollo Lake convertible with pen support 05/16/2017 at 1:56 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Asus has quietly added a new convertible laptop to its website. The Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is a notebook with an 11.6 inch touchscreen display, a 360-degree hinge that lets you use the computer as a tablet, and support for writing or drawing with a pressure-sensitive Asus Pen. The notebook will be available in a few different configurations, but each model features a 1366 x 768 pixel display and Intel Apollo Lake processor, suggesting that these will be relatively affordable machines. The Asus VivoBook Flip E12 E203NA supports Intel Celeron N3350 dual-core or Pentium N4200 quad-core processor options, 2GB or 4GB of DDR3L-1600 memory, and Windows 10 Home or the Linux-based Endless OS. It comes with 32GB, 64GB, of 128GB of eMMC storage, and each model has 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, a microSD card slot, and HDMI port. It also has a fingerprint sensor and features a 38 Wh battery. Te notebook measures 11.5″ x 7.8″ x 0.67″ and weighs about 2.4 pounds. Asus also recently added a non-convertible VivoBook E12 E203NAH laptop to its line of compact, low-power notebooks. That model has 500GB and 1TB hard drive options, weighs about 2.6 pounds, and measures 0.85 inches thick. But it lacks pen support.     via WinFuture Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Asus VivoBook Flip 12 is an Apollo Lake convertible with pen support" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest sportniik Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

But it's really AMD's Vega GPUs that people have been holding out for. Earlier this morning the company confirmed it would start shipping the first Vega GPUs - although not the consumer cards people are expecting - from the end of next month - and as an added bonus, there's a new 16 core CPU to boot. The details on both vary, so we'll do this in reverse order. AMD's latest CPU, which will undeniably be pitched against the recently leaked Skylake-X and upcoming Kaby Lake-X offerings from Intel, will have 16 cores, 32 threads, and will sport the name of "Threadripper". Image: AMD We don't have any details on pricing or a specific release date beyond the Australian winter, although it's expected that AMD will announce more about the CPU at Computex at the end of the month. It's pitched as a "ultra-premium" desktop CPU, meaning it will probably cost close to, if not more than, $1000 locally. That said, AMD might decide to be super aggressive with their pricing (but given that previous CPUs in this category have cost over $2000 locally, thanks to a lack of competition, don't expect it to be too affordable). Report: Intel Will Introduce The i9 Series Later This Year It's already been a big year in the CPU market with the successful launch of AMD's Ryzen CPUs. But it's not over yet. Intel has a new line of CPUs of their own, starting with Skylake-X in June this year. Read more But the real icing on the cake, which turned out really to be just the cherry, was some confirmation around Vega. Vega is AMD's follow-up to the Polaris line of GPUs, which started with the RX 400 series last year. Some unverified benchmarks have been appearing on the internet over the course of the last few weeks. And while those are fun to speculate about, they're unverified, and they're also not real-world figures. But what is now officially known is that the first Vega product, the Vega Frontier Edition, will go on the market from late June. Bad news: the Vega FE card isn't marketed to gamers. AMD's pitching it as the fastest graphics card on the market, with 16GB of HBM2 memory, but none of their internal benchmarks or messaging aimed the card at gamers in the slightest. Image: AMD Much like the Polaris cards last year, Computex seems like the right territory for AMD to start talking about Vega gaming cards. And at the very least, the analyst briefing gives people a rough idea of when they can expect things to materialise - in other words, definitely not this month, and probably not for most of June either. As an aside, the rest of the Ryzen lineup is still coming later this year as well. The Ryzen 3 CPUs are still scheduled to land in the third quarter, while the first Ryzen APU will appear in consumer products from the second half of this year.

I wouldn't expect details until at least Computex, though. Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita May 17, 2017, 4:49pm That would be great, I'd mostly like to know which bracket it is in, under $5K?

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    EXCLUSIVE: Clapper’s Intel ‘Reforms’ Helped Rice ‘Unmask’ Americans Richard Pollock Reporter 8:51 PM 05/16/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper’s creation of a cloud-computing platform in 2013 made it far easier for officials like former White House National Security Advisor Susan Rice to ‘unmask’ individual Americans without creating a digital paper trail leading back to her, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group has learned. Clapper’s system enabled tens of thousands of government officials to share previously off-limits intelligence information, according to knowledgeable officials who tracked the cloud-computing initiative of the former DNI under President Barack Obama. Commander Jennifer E. Dyer, a 21-year naval intelligence officer, told TheDCNF that Clapper’s effort dramatically altered the rules that previously barred access to phone records of U.S. citizens unless there was prior approval following rigorous National Security Agency (NSA) review. NSA can compile phone records of American citizens talking to foreign officials under Section 702 of the USA Patriot Act. It allows the spy agency to legally eavesdrop on innocent American citizens who are inadvertently swept up in telephone conversations with foreign officials. NSA can keep the records for as long as five years. The 702 provision expires at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes it. Citizens normally are referred to as “American A” or “American B” in the 702 reports. The names are “masked” from intelligence officials. Dyer says that all changed after Clapper’s cloud computing system was put into place. “After the technology had changed and the workplace policies had changed, basically that access was based on ‘user permissions’ that would allow you to look into the database itself. You didn’t have to ask anyone at NSA to retrieve the information,” Dyer said. “As long as the permissions on your user account were such that you were certified to have access to that information, then you could go in and get it yourself,” Dyer said. “A key aspect of cloud technology is that to do that retrieval, you don’t have to set up the whole line of an ‘audit-able’ chain.” Clapper served as Obama’s DNI from 2010 to 2017, and in 2011, he set into motion wide ranging “reforms” that sought the creation of a cloud computing platform tied to Intelligence Community IT Enterprise, or ICITE. “IC Research,” another Clapper innovation, also permitted greater intelligence agency collaboration within the cloud. Clapper justified his move in the name of improving information-sharing among intelligence officials and breaking down barriers between agencies, a policy encouraged following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But Clapper’s changes lowered security standards for sharing NSA and CIA intelligence data. Many top intelligence officials were enabled to access raw intelligence about U.S. citizens as a result. Obama also pushed for more aggressive information sharing in the final days of his administration when he authorized all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to access raw NSA data through Executive Order 12333. He amended the Reagan era executive order Jan. 3. Auditing unmasking actions to determine who received individuals’ names is also made more difficult with cloud computing, according to Dyer. Earlier this year, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was unmasked, and his name was leaked to the media. He briefly served as President Donald Trump’s national security advisor before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. The number of Section 702 American citizen “targets” since Clapper’s system began in 2013 has surged from 89,000 to 106,000 in 2016, a 19 percent increase according to a 2016 report from the former DNI’s office. Similarly, the number of intelligence community employees who share information now exceeds 50,000, compared to only 9,000 in 2014, according to Kendrea DeLauter, IC Desktop Environment Joint Program Manager at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Ashley Gorski, an ACLU staff attorney for its National Security Project, told TheDCNF the standards for surveillance and unmasking of private citizens are too low. “Seventeen different agencies shouldn’t be sifting through Americans’ emails without ever obtaining a warrant,” Gorski said. “The standard for unmasking someone’s identity in these intercepted communications is a low one, and the risk of abuse is real.” Retired Col. James Waurishuk, who twice served on the National Security Council, told TheDCNF security precautions under the Clapper system were “diluted because more people now had more access.” Waurishuk believes it will be difficult to trace Rice’s unmasking requests as she sought the information from subordinates. “Susan Rice is not going to be sitting there, reading thousands of intercepts,” he said. Dyer agreed, saying “Susan Rice is not going to have any literal IT involvement. I’m sure it’s the worker-bee who did the actual work.” Waurishuk, who is the vice president of OPSEC, an advocacy group for former Special Forces and intelligence officials, believes Rice was emboldened given that the cloud system reduced a digital paper trail. “Because they knew they were doing illegal stuff, the last thing they want to do is have a paper trail.  I think they never believed they were ever going to get caught,” he told the DCNF. Clapper’s new system of “collaboration” for intelligence officials met resistance from some within the intelligence community. Gregory Treverton, who was National Intelligence Council chairman under Clapper, conceded in a January 2016 report that many intelligence officials believed some of the information-sharing went too far. He said many intelligence officials complained there were “too many,” attempts at collaboration. Clapper’s $600 million contract for the new system met fierce opposition from other high-tech companies when it was awarded to Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Web Services. The rivals charged that Bezos received preferential treatment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld a protest IBM and another unnamed firm submitted in 2013, and the agency ordered the bid reconsidered. Clapper failed to evaluate prices comparably, and he waived a bidding requirement only for Amazon, according to Ralph O. White, managing associate general counsel for procurement law at GAO. AT&T and Microsoft also filed complaints about the Amazon win. Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of Amazon’s request for judgment in October 2013. The activist group, RootsAction.org, collected 15,000 signatures in a petition drive, complaining “Amazon’s offer wasn’t the low bid, but it won the CIA contract anyway.” Bezos is a well-known liberal who owns the Washington Post. He hired former Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney as a top executive in his company.

Apple typically uses its mostly-annual developers conference to announce new software updates to existing products, giving developers a chance to become acquainted with the changes and maybe get their third-party integrations, tie-ins, services, and apps ready. However, this year, Apple will also announce hardware updates. It will refresh its laptop lineup at WWDC 207 in June, according to Bloomberg. Apple is planning three new laptops: the MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip, and the 13-inch MacBook Air will get a new processor. Bloomberg noted Apple wants to keep its MacBook laptop line fresh for customers, especially due to recent hardware pushes from rivals, such as Microsoft, as well as declining iPad sales. Apple's Siri speaker: What's the story so far? iPad Pro 10.5-inch could be launched in June following case leak The updated MacBook Laptops will apparently still look the same; they're only getting different internal architecture. In other words, none of the updates are major changes. The MacBook and MacBook Air are definitely due for an update, considering they were last updated in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Check out Pocket-lint's WWDC round-up to see what else Apple may announce at its 5 June keynote. Keep in mind Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for future MacBook Pro models, which would manage their low-power mode, but it's unclear if that chip will be ready in time for WWDC 2017.

McMaster defended President Donald Trump's decision to share sensitive intelligence with Russian officials during last week's visit as "wholly appropriate" amid a firestorm of criticism Tuesday. The White House was in damage control mode over media reports Monday that Trump disclosed highly classified information from an ally with Russia. NBC News confirmed Tuesday that Israel was the key partner that provided the ISIS-related intelligence, according to three government officials with knowledge of the matter. Related: LIVE BLOG: White House Scrambles After Trump's Gives Russia Intel McMaster said the president shared the information in "context of the conversation" with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, saying it was "wholly appropriate to that conversation" and "consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leader with whom he's engaged." McMaster would not confirm if that information was classified. "I was in the room, the Secretary of State was in the room, as you know, the deputy adviser for national security, Dina Powell, and none of us felt in any way that conversation was inappropriate," McMaster said. During those conversations, Trump also disclosed the city in ISIS-held Syria from which that intelligence emanated, McMaster confirmed.

The president "wasn't aware of where this came from. He wasn't briefed on the source of this information," McMaster said. Two U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News that many people inside the U.S. intelligence community dispute McMaster's characterization that Trump's sharing of sensitive terrorism intelligence with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador was "appropriate." Normally, when the U.S. government wants to share intelligence with Russia, there is an elaborate vetting process, current and former officials told NBC News. Sometimes the reports are marked "REL Russia," for "releasable Russia." RELATED: Trump Defends 'Right' to Share Info With Russia After Classified Intel Reports "There is a process for sharing releasable intelligence with the Russians," Eric Pelofsky, a former National Security Council senior director, told NBC News. "For the president, it could take a few hours — and it would be sanitized in a way that would be respectful of the risk. And, likely as part of that process, our intelligence community would engage our intelligence partner so that we would not jeopardize the continuing flow of intelligence from them." Following Trump's conversations with the Russians, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert reached out to the CIA and the National Security Agency likely out of "an overabundance of caution," McMaster said. He added he has not spoken with Bossert about why he reached out. The intelligence community, the two officials told NBC News, feels Bossert alerted them because Trump shared intelligence about the laptop bomb threat derived from a partner country. They added that U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that the disclosure could compromise the source of the information, will lead the partner to stop sharing, and will make other countries reluctant to share intelligence with the U.S. McMaster on Tuesday said that he was not concerned that allies would stop sharing information with the U.S. as a result of Trump's conversations with the Russians. Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, while not confirming his nation as the source of intelligence, said in a statement that his country "has full confidence in our intelligence sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump." On Monday, McMaster denied that Trump shared "sources or methods" with the Russians — notable wording considering the story first reported by The Washington Post did not report that Trump shared sources or methods, only classified information.

But a series of Trump tweets Tuesday morning flew in the face of those denials, seemingly corroborating the Washington Post's reporting that information was shared. "I wanted to share with Russia…facts pertaining…to terrorism and airline flight safety," the president tweeted. Trump's sharing information with the Russian officials is the latest turn in a saga that has put the spotlight on campaign and former administration officials and questions into any possible relationship with Moscow. President Trump may not have violated a law in revealing or discussing classified information, a former senior national security lawyer told NBC News. A president has the ultimate authority in the government to decide what's classified — even if they blurt out or otherwise reveal classified information without a deliberate declassification process. This is not the first time President Trump has put forth statements that contradict his White House surrogates and spokespeople. Last week, in an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, Trump said he would have fired former FBI Director James Comey "regardless" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's recommendation — the opposite explanation offered by chief White House officials, Vice President Mike Pence, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the immediate aftermath of the firing. On Tuesday, the White House reiterated that they felt "real issue," in information sharing was that national security was being compromised by leaks — a complaint the Trump White House has often voiced. McMaster said "those violating confidentiality" by releasing information to the press could "make American citizens and others more vulnerable."

In response to questions, McConnell said that he has not lost confidence in the president and that he still trusts him with classified information. "I think it would be helpful to have less drama emanating from the white house," McConnell told reporters, not directly responding to the latest controversy flowing out of the executive branch.

An exasperated Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who is facing a difficult re-election in 2018, said that he's still waiting for more information about what actually happened, but is hoping for a break from the near-daily barrage. "It would be nice to have a drama-free week," Flake said. When asked if he thinks that's likely, he said, "I don't know." Sen. Susan Collins expressed similar sentiments just minutes after the news broke Monday night. "Can we have a crisis-free day? That's all I'm asking," she said. RELATED: Follow Live as White House Scrambles After Trump Gave Russia Intel While Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the latest wasn't a factor in his decision, he told the Trump administration on Wednesday that he was withdrawing his name from consideration for FBI director. "I've informed the Administration that I'm committed to helping them find such an individual, and that the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate," Cornyn wrote in a statement. Still, key members of Congress have been waiting to hear from the White House on questions they have pertaining to Trump's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Servey Kislyak. Republican leaders are the only members to have heard from the White House on the topic so far. House Speaker Paul Ryan's office confirms that they have talked to the White House while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office would neither confirm nor deny that a conversation took place. Democratic leaders, however, said they have not heard from administration officials, according to aides. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is expected to brief the House Intelligence Committee in a pre-scheduled briefing Tuesday evening. And the Senate Intelligence Committee is also meeting for a regularly-scheduled weekly briefing, which was supposed to be on a different topic but has devolved into a discussion on the latest controversy. "My hope is we may get some level of update at Intel (Committee meeting) later today," Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told reporters. Many Republicans have been reluctant to comment, saying that they want to learn more. "I'm going to wait until I get briefed on it. I don't know the whole story," Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley said when asked for a response. Others, however, have weighed in, like Sen. John McCain, who called the reports "deeply disturbing." "Reports that this information was provided by a U.S. ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America's allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future," McCain said. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who was a contender to be Trump's secretary of state, was one of the first Republicans to react to the news, saying the reports were "worrisome." "The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline," Corker said, is creating a "worrisome environment." Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., described the entire episode as "weird" but cautioned that the president appeared to have operated within his authority. "It's very difficult for a president to break laws related to classification," Sasse said Tuesday on Fox News. "But the debate about imprudence, that's a really important debate," he said. "It's not helpful that this was with the Russians. Right? I mean this was just weird," Sasse added.

"We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation's secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration," said House Speaker Paul Ryan spokesman Doug Andres in a statement Monday night. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., made the case for an all-senator briefing on the meeting. "If it is in fact true that information that shared with the Russian ambassador, it seems to me it can be shared with United States senators," Tillis said. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also a member of the Intelligence Committee, said that he's asked the White House for more information. The White House is expected to reach out to members of Congress today to brief them on the developments. "I'm not disputing it, I'm not admitting it I just want to know more," he said. Some Republicans have remained mum. When asked if he had any reaction to the reports, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., simply said "none." He refused to answer any follow up questions and proceeded to walk into the Finance Committee room to attend a hearing on Medicare. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the White House to release the transcripts from the Lavrov and Trump meeting to the Congressional intelligence committees. "Producing the transcripts ... is the only way for this administration to categorically prove the report's untrue," Schumer said.

Five Things to Read Comey Wrote Memo Saying Trump Urged Him to Drop Flynn Investigation: Sources (NBC News): Fired FBI Director James Comey wrote an internal memo saying President Donald Trump asked him to shut down an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, multiple sources with firsthand knowledge of the memo told NBC News on Tuesday. Israel Was Source of Intelligence Trump Shared With Russians (NBC News): Israel was the source of ISIS-related intelligence that President Donald Trump shared with Russia last week, according to three government officials with knowledge of the matter. At a Besieged White House, Tempers Flare and Confusion Swirls (The New York Times): In private, three administration officials conceded that they could not publicly articulate their most compelling — and honest — defense of the president: that Mr. Trump, a hasty and indifferent reader of printed briefing materials, simply did not possess the interest or knowledge of the granular details of intelligence gathering to leak specific sources and methods of intelligence gathering that would do harm to United States allies. European Country Might Halt US Intel Sharing (The Associated Press): "A senior European intelligence official tells The Associated Press that his country might stop sharing information with the United States if it confirms President Donald Trump shared classified details with Russian officials. The official said Tuesday that doing so "could be a risk for our sources." No, Trump Did Not Break the Law In Talking Classified Details With the Russians (Washington Post): "When it comes to classification issues and those kinds of things, he's not above the law," said Edward B. MacMahon Jr., a criminal defense lawyer who has done significant work on cases involving classified information. "He basically is the law."

The memo was part of a paper trail Comey built documenting what he believed to be Trump's campaign to derail the FBI's investigation of alleged Russian ties to his presidential campaign. A second source, a former federal law enforcement official, also confirmed the existence of the memo to NBC News.

Some Democratic lawmakers and former intelligence officials warned that, depending on what exactly Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the lives of those gathering the intel provided by Israel to the U.S. may now be at risk. "They may have agents in the field using a sensitive collection system. They may have an electronic collection system. Whatever it is, Israel is going to be pulling it out right now because they are not going to take any chances that whoever they have that is this close to ISIS is going to survive for the next 24 hours," Malcolm Nance, a former U.S. intelligence official, said on MSNBC on Tuesday. Democrats as well cautioned in broad terms that Trump's disclosures could also put U.S. lives in danger. However, it remains largely unclear what exact information the president reportedly shared and how it would directly threaten American lives. "Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said the information Trump divulged to the Russians was "wholly appropriate" while speaking to reporters Tuesday.

McMaster's characterization that President Donald Trump's sharing of sensitive terrorism intelligence with the Russian foreign minister was "appropriate." The reason White House counter terrorism adviser Tom Bossert alerted the CIA and the NSA shortly after the meeting, these officials said, is that Trump shared intelligence about the laptop bomb threat derived from a partner country. McMaster confirmed that Trump also disclosed the city in ISIS-held Syria from which that intelligence emanated. McMaster said in a briefing early Tuesday afternoon, "It was nothing that you would not know from open source reporting." But U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that the disclosure could compromise the source of the information, will lead the partner to stop sharing and will make other countries reluctant to share intelligence with the United States. - MSNBC Politics Managing Editor Dafna Linzer and National Security Reporter Ken Dilanian Facebook Twitter Email Sen.

"If this report is in indeed true, it would mean that the president may have badly damaged our national security, nothing less, and in several ways." "If the reporting is accurate, in one fell swoop, the president could have unsettled our allies, emboldened our adversaries, endangered our military and intelligence officers world over and exposed our nation to greater risk." "Following so closely after Mr. Comey's firing which was rationalized to the press and the American public in several different ways over the course of a week, this administration now faces a crisis of credibility."

I don't expect Intel to follow tit for tat, thread to thread, but rather on other merits like single core performance".   I totally agree, especially with Patrick's comments for AMD hitting the $1000+ price point with ThreadRipper. It will push Intel to react, which is probably why we're hearing about Intel's upcoming Core i9 range with up to 12C/24T of performance at up to a blistering 4.5GHz with their purported Turbo Boost 3.0 technology. It's an exciting time to be a technology enthusiast, that's for sure.

Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email President Trump’s decision to share highly classified intelligence about an ISIS plot with Russian officials last week endangered the life of an Israeli spy embedded within the terror organization, ABC News reported Tuesday. The information, which was provided by Israel to U.S. intelligence, was about an ISIS plan to blow up an airplane with a bomb hidden inside a laptop in a way that could evade airport security, ABC reported, citing current and former U.S. officials. The terror group killed more than 200 people two years ago when it blew up a Russian airliner with a bomb hidden in a soda can. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said Tuesday that the common threat that the U.S. and Russia face from ISIS justified the disclosure. But the former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, told ABC that the president’s actions were inappropriate. “Russia is not part of the ISIS coalition,” he said. “They are not our partner.” Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro warned ABC that the incident would “inevitably cause elements of Israel’s intelligence service to demonstrate more caution” when sharing intelligence with its chief ally. This may already be happening: Danny Yatom, the former head of Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence organization, told CBS News that Israel “will think twice before conveying very sensitive information.” Contact Aiden Pink at pink@forward.com or on Twitter, @aidenpink.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Apple is rumored to introduce new MacBook and MacBook Pro upgrades at WWDC 2017 which kicks off next month. This is interesting as for a while now, WWDC has stopped focusing on hardware launches. However the report claims that the MacBook Pro will be upgraded with a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel, while the MacBook is also said to get a faster Intel chip but it was not mentioned as to what it might be. The 13-inch MacBook Air is also said to be under consideration for an upgrade but it was not confirmed. Unsurprisingly Apple declined to comment on the report. That being said we should note that this report is in line with an earlier report that suggested that we could expect an upgrade to the MacBook Pro in 2017 that could potentially be cheaper. However the report claimed that the new laptops would use Intel’s Canonlake CPU and offer up to 32GB of RAM. It is possible that the upgrades introduced at WWDC would merely be a slight refresh, and that maybe a bigger upgrade could come in the later part of the year. Either way take it with a grain of salt and check back with us in the coming weeks for the details. Filed in Apple >Computers >Rumors.

Apple reportedly will announce its latest MacBook and MacBook Pro, and is also considering updating the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been upgraded in years. Read: MacBook Pro Touch Bar Problems: Apple Users Complain Of 'Popping' Sound Coming From Laptop The MacBook Pro reportedly will come with a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel. Apple is also working on a new 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip, the report said.  As for the MacBook Air, the company will update the 13-inch laptop with a new processor. The new MacBook Pro will look much like the previous model and will mostly differ in internal architecture. Apple has been working on a new in-house chip for a future MacBook Pro that manages the laptops low-power mode, but it’s unclear whether it will be included in the June’s lineup. The current MacBook Pro was released last fall and featured the Touch Bar. However, the laptop faced hurdles with its battery. Consumer Reports declined in December to recommend the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar because of “highly inconsistent” poor battery life tests. In Febraury, users reported experiencing problems with the MacBook Pro’s keyboard, and other users said they were hearing a “popping” noise coming from their units. The new lineup could win back disappointed MacBook fans. Apple’s new laptops could also help against competition from Microsoft, which recently introduced the Surface Laptop. Read: Surface Laptop: Why The Windows 10 S MacBook Clone May Struggle - Price, Specs & More The new MacBook lineup also could help Apple with its declining iPad sales. A recent report said Apple could phase out the iPad Mini. Apple already discontinued the iPad Mini 4 32GB model earlier this year and previously dropped the iPad Air. Apple is expected to introduce the iPad Pro 2 at the upcoming WWDC, which will take place next month in San Jose, California. What Else Will Be Announced In WWDC? Along with the MacBook lineup, Apple is also expected to announce an update to macOS at WWDC, as well as tvOS and watchOS. The company could give the work a preview of iOS 11 for iPads and iPhones. The update is supposed to boost Siri capabilities and introduce Theater Mode for devices. iOS 11 is also rumored to revamp the Music App to push Apple’s original video content. The company is also expected to announce another device: a Siri speaker. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said there is an "over 50 percent chance” the speaker will be revealed at WWDC. The Siri speaker will compete with Amazon’s multiple Alexa-powered devices and Google Home. Amazon already debuted two Echo devices this spring, the Echo Look, which acts like a style assistant, and the Echo Show, which comes with a built-in display. Apple is also expected to announce developments in Apple Pay.

This year, however, WWDC will be a tad more exciting. Don't Miss: This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed Amid reports that Apple has plans to introduce a brand new Siri-based smart speaker and iPad Pro at WWDC next month, we’re now getting word that Apple in just a few weeks may also unveil a revamped MacBook Pro and a few other surprises. According to a fresh report from Bloomberg, Apple at WWDC may announce three new notebooks, including a updated MacBook Pro, a new MacBook model, and last but not least, a new MacBook Air. Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Incidentally, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is on record stating that Apple’s 2017 MacBook Pro refresh will include support for 32GB of RAM. Word of a varied Apple notebook refresh is certainly exciting, especially for users who haven’t yet pulled the trigger on Apple’s new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Upon its initial release last Fall, Apple’s flagship notebook was lambasted for being overpriced and underpowered. With a refresh on the horizon, the MacBook Pro will at the very least provide users with more bang for their buck. Additionally, it’s reassuring to see that Apple hasn’t completely forgotten about the MacBook Air. Indeed, the last time Apple significantly refreshed its svelte notebook was back in 20 Trending right now: This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed Brand new HTC U11 did to the Google Pixel what the Galaxy S8 couldn’t 5 HTC U11 features you won’t find on the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7 See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Meet this new apple-picking robot Yahoo Tech Mars rover reaches site that scientists still can’t explain BGR News Control your Roomba with just your voice via this new Alexa integration Yahoo Tech Scientists just discovered something incredible about the dinosaur-killer asteroid BGR News Pogue's Basics: How to create a search-and-replace macro in Word Yahoo Tech We noshed on Nougat, and Android 7.0 is Google’s sweetest update yet Yahoo Tech Build your own DIY video game console Yahoo Tech The wireless over-ear headphones that beat Beats are back on sale on Amazon BGR News The first flying car is available for pre-order Yahoo Tech Intel and AMD are going to war with next-gen CPUs BGR News

(CAR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Take it all with a grain of salt, because it might not be true. On the other hand, by the time you’re reading this, it may well have been confirmed. That is, chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is reportedly going to be leaning more on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to meet its graphical display technology needs, and less on Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The so-unconfirmed report catapulted AMD stock 8% higher, though it didn’t have any measurable impact on the value of NVDA or INTC stock. Source: Shutterstock The rumors will (hopefully) be verified or debunked at Tuesday afternoon’s analyst day event, which includes a Q&A session during which the matter will almost certainly be brought up. Given the fact that this is an idea that has surfaced once before and was rekindled by a reasonably credible source, though, investors may want to take note. Intel and AMD: Just Rumors So Far, But… This isn’t the first time NVDA or INTC stock owners have heard about the possibility. The buzz first surfaced in March … the same month Intel’s GPU licensing deal with Nvidia expired. Although Intel clearly has to use some sort of technology to connect computer screens with the computer itself, several choices — including Nvidia’s technology no longer protected by patents — are at its disposal. With something of a next-generation era of computing requiring next-generation display management, however, Intel has to offer cutting-edge GPU (graphics processing units) tech if it wants to remain competitive. Advanced Micro Devices, which competes with Nvidia in the GPU market, was a widely presumed GPU partner simply because AMD is already working with Intel on some other fronts and tapping Advanced Micro Devices for its graphical processing know-how would be a strong gesture of good faith. There’s also the not-so-small matter that Nvidia has sued partner Intel in the past, forcing it to abode by an agreement that was less than ideal. Fast forward to today. Technology news website Fudzilla broke the story that Intel is using AMD’s graphics tech. Fudzilla reporter Fuad Abazovic’s exact words: “We can now confirm the rumors that Intel has given up on Nvidia because it has written a cheque to license AMD’s graphics.” Abazovic was the only interested party willing or able to confirm the deal. An official response from AMD explained: “We haven’t announced any licensing deals with Intel and, as a matter of policy, don’t comment on rumor or speculation. We do have our financial analyst day this afternoon and will have an executive QA session, so the question may come up from someone in the room and be addressed then. For now, we aren’t commenting on the speculation per corporate policy.” Neither Nvidia nor Intel have said a word about the rumor either. So What? Not than an official confirmation would divulge such details, but the licensing deal Intel had with Nvidia was reportedly worth $200 million per year in royalties. Presuming any deal with AMD would be similarly sized, such an agreement could add $200 million worth of high-margin revenue to Advanced Micro Devices’ annual top line of around $4.4 billion. From that perspective, even if there was some truth to the whispers, it would be tough to deem the deal a game-changer for AMD or for INTC stock.

Applied Materials, Lam Research Hiked UBS analyst Stephen Chin reiterated buy ratings on Applied Materials and Lam Research on Tuesday. He raised his price target on Applied to 51 from 44 and on Lam to 180 from 158. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini maintained his neutral rating on Applied on Tuesday, but upped his price target to 40 from 35. Applied ended the day up 1.7% to close at 45.07 on the stock market today, a record high. Lam closed up 0.9% to 152.56 on Tuesday, another record high. Chin has increased confidence in prospects for Applied and Lam in China after seeing evidence that two of China's five announced indigenous memory chip fabs are well into the construction phase. IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes eight chip-industry companies including Applied Materials and Lam Research. AMD Gets Boost From Intel Deal AMD stock jumped 11.7% to close at 12.75 Tuesday after tech site Fudzilla reported that Intel has agreed to license AMD's graphics chip technology after its deal with Nvidia (NVDA) expired. Nvidia stock ignored the news, rising to a record of 137.44 intraday Tuesday. It was up 1.9% to end the regular trading session at 136.81. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said Intel licensing AMD's graphics chip technology would not be a good sign for Intel. "We believe Intel is in organizational turmoil trying to adjust to Nvidia's AI momentum in the data center, AMD's sudden relevance in x86 CPUs, and the digestion of various questionable acquisitions," Mosesmann said. "Intel does not need more chaos and the Nvidia IP they have should suffice for now. If they do end up licensing AMD graphics IP then things may be worse at Intel than even we have believed." Mosesmann rates Intel stock as sell as AMD and Nvidia shares as buy. Intel stock finished the trading day up 0.5% to 35.82.

Seth Moulton are among those in Massachusetts speaking out about President Trump's alleged sharing of sensitive Israeli intelligence with Russian officials. (Published Tuesday, May 16, 2017) Lawmakers across New England are calling reports of President Donald Trump sharing classified intelligence with Russians "troubling" and "disturbing." Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said that while Trump has the legal authority to declassify information, it would be very "troubling" if he did. She also called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to be immediately briefed. McMaster: Trump Did Not Know Source of Shared Intel President Donald Trump was unaware of the source of intelligence he shared with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, national security adviser H.R. McMaster at a news conference on Tuesday, May 16, 2017. He al Trump's sharing the information was appropriate.(Published Tuesday, May 16, 2017) "Jeopardizing the sources and methods that support our intelligence gathering apparatus, or those of an ally, are of grave concern," Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said in a series of tweets. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) also took to Twitter in the aftermath of the Washington Post's explosive report. Comey Memo Claims Trump Urged Him to Drop Flynn Probe "Congress must investigate Trump's irresponsible action & take steps to ensure he does no addl [sic] damage to natl sec [sic] in his dealings w [sic] #Russia," he wrote. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a series of tweets that Trump is "failing" at protecting the country. Donald Trump's Presidency in Photos Getty Images "A week ago Trump fired Comey. Now this," he tweeted. "It's vitally important that Trump make public any recordings he has of talks in the Oval Office." Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) couldn't help but wonder on Twitter why Republicans would chant "Lock her up" in reference to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email server scandal, but are staying relatively quiet regarding Trump allegedly revealing classified information to Russia. Facing Criticism, WH Defends Trump Sharing Intel With Russia "President Trump has long been careless with the truth, but now he appears to have gone further," he tweeted. Rhode Island's other Democratic senator, Jack Reed, called Trump's recklessness "deeply disturbing and clearly problematic." UpdatedTrump, Turkish Leader Hail Ties Despite US Arming of Kurds "I don't believe the President intentionally meant to reveal highly secretive information to the Russians," he continued. "But if the Washington Post report is accurate then the President crossed a line that could have a real negative impact on national security and harm relations with our allies." New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said she was "very concerned" about President Trump's alleged intelligence sharing and called for a classified briefing for members of the Senate. FBI Chief's Unceremonious Ouster Boomerangs on President "All potential Trump tapes should be subpoenaed to uncover truth and preserve evidence - both Comey and meeting with Russians," Sen.

The appointment “could well turn into a shield for wrongdoing,” wrapping the investigation “in secrecy for months and years” and ultimately failing “to answer any of the important questions demanding answers.” Better to name “a select committee of Congress or an independent commission of nonpartisan experts established by Congress” which “seeks truth,” not evidence of specific crimes. Indeed, it would be “very difficult” to find a prosecutable crime. Bottom line: “It’s more important that the investigation be speedy and its full conclusions shared with the public than that it lead to indictments, prosecutions and penalties.” Foreign expert: Why No Royal Visit to Israel? Prince Charles was set to visit Israel to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, in which Britain gave its support to a Jewish homeland — but the trip has now been canceled, notes Elliott Abrams at Newsweek. This first state visit ever by a British royal would have honored soldiers killed during the World War I Palestine campaign. But thanks to Britain’s Foreign Office, “an official visit — to see and honor the country — appears to be beyond the pale.” Reports cited fears of antagonizing Arab states, but with Israeli-Gulf state relations improving, “it is plain silly to believe that they would be horribly ‘upset’ if Charles visited Israel.” So the decision “reflects plain ignorance — or something far worse.” Defense analyst: Pyongyang Threat Getting Worse The Korean War, recalls Harry Kazlanis at Fox News, took 2.5 million lives. Another one, “not in some far-away future, but in the here and now,” could “turn cities like Seoul, Tokyo and soon Los Angeles into atomic ash heaps.” For even in failed tests, “North Korea gains valuable data for the next test and eventually, a weapon that can lay waste to our homeland.” Kim Jong-un already has 12-20 nuclear weapons and “5,000 tons of chemical weapons.” Would he use them? “The answer is a resounding yes,” because he’s “crazy like a fox about ensuring his survival.” Which is why President Trump “must use cyber technology” against Kim’s WMD program and “build up regional and homeland missile defenses to nullify Pyongyang’s growing arsenal.” Legal reformer: New York’s Pre-Existing Condition Yet another report rates New York state “dead last as a place for physicians to practice,” and the primary reason why is “the staggering cost of medical liability insurance,” contends Thomas Stebbins at Gotham Gazette. Indeed, “nearly 20 percent of all the medical liability payouts in the US are paid in New York,” which drives local doctors out of state and weakens access to care. Since 2003, New York City has lost 16 hospitals; many of the remainder “have opted to ‘go naked’ and not carry any medical liability insurance at all.” Yet many insurers “are operating at a loss.” The “real culprit . . . is New York’s broken liability laws” that are “bought and paid for by the state’s powerful trial-lawyer special-interest lobby.” Now Albany is considering extending the statute of limitations on filing a medical-liability claim. That will only “force more medical professionals” to flee. — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under donald trump ,  editorial ,  foreign policy ,  health care ,  intelligence ,  israel ,  new york ,  north korea ,  prince charles ,  russia Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next This Miss USA combines brains, beauty and an independent m...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Aaron Yoo The entire MacBook line is getting updated this month, report claims Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 16th, 2017 at 3:04 PM Share Tweet Over the past few years, Apple’s WWDC event has been a decidedly software-only affair, with nearly all the focus centering on upcoming iterations of iOS, macOS, and more recently, watchOS and tvOS. This year, however, WWDC will be a tad more exciting. Don't Miss: This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed Amid reports that Apple has plans to introduce a brand new Siri-based smart speaker and iPad Pro at WWDC next month, we’re now getting word that Apple in just a few weeks may also unveil a revamped MacBook Pro and a few other surprises. According to a fresh report from Bloomberg, Apple at WWDC may announce three new notebooks, including a updated MacBook Pro, a new MacBook model, and last but not least, a new MacBook Air. Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp., said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Apple is also working on a new version of the 12-inch MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company has also considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple’s cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said. Incidentally, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is on record stating that Apple’s 2017 MacBook Pro refresh will include support for 32GB of RAM. Word of a varied Apple notebook refresh is certainly exciting, especially for users who haven’t yet pulled the trigger on Apple’s new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Upon its initial release last Fall, Apple’s flagship notebook was lambasted for being overpriced and underpowered. With a refresh on the horizon, the MacBook Pro will at the very least provide users with more bang for their buck. Additionally, it’s reassuring to see that Apple hasn’t completely forgotten about the MacBook Air. Indeed, the last time Apple significantly refreshed its svelte notebook was back in 20 Tags: Apple, MacBook Pro, WWDC 2017 View Comments Trending 1 Tech This new iPhone 8 leak has left us perplexed 2 Tech New report confirms highly anticipated Galaxy Note 8 feature 3 Tech Brand new HTC U11 did to the Google Pixel what the Galaxy S8 couldn’t 4 Tech WannaCry: Everything you need to know about the global ransomware attack 5 Tech Brand new photo of a silver Model 3 surfaces online Picked For You Tim Cook’s refusal to help FBI hack iPhone is validated by ‘WannaCry’ ransomware attack By Yoni Heisler 2 days ago New report confirms highly anticipated Galaxy Note 8 feature By Jacob Siegal 14 hours ago Brand new HTC U11 did to the Google Pixel what the Galaxy S8 couldn’t By Chris Smith 19 hours ago Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

[Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images] By Lydia Dishman3 minute Read Apart from the braggadocio and self aggrandizement we’ve come to expect, Trump’s latest boast about the classified intel he shared with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reaches into a national security danger zone. Of course, as the Washington Post report notes, a President has the authority to declassify information. But the implications of this latest round of communication calls into question the larger issue of the working culture that flourishes under a leader like Trump. advertisement Although he’s never been professionally diagnosed as such, psychologist Dan McAdams did a thoughtful and lengthy exposition of Trump’s personality for The Atlantic that suggests he’s a narcissist. Such a personality is characterized, in part, by bragging (something Trump excels at). In the workplace, corporate narcissism comes with an array of pros and cons. The upshot of narcissism can be a leader that’s viewed as visionary and charismatic. As Michael Maccoby observed in Harvard Business Review, “Today’s CEOs–superstars such as Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Jack Welch–hire their own publicists, write books, grant spontaneous interviews, and actively promote their personal philosophies.”  Yet as Maccoby notes, Freud shone a light on a narcissist’s dark side. Narcissists tend to emotionally isolated, highly distrustful, and rage against perceived threats. Achievements can feed feelings of grandiosity. (see this, or this, or this, or many of Trump’s other tweets). Working For A Narcissist Of course, a lack of trust in your boss isn’t exclusive to those working for Trump. The majority of the 33,000 people surveyed in Edelman’s “Trust Barometer”  believe that their CEO was exhibiting unethical behavior. We’ve seen how leadership at Wells Fargo, Volkswagen, Uber, and others have all contributed to breeding corporate cultures that condoned unethical behaviors. On the one hand, Trump’s administration is breeding a culture of leakers that surpasses anything we’ve seen during a presidential administration. As Jonah Goldberg, senior editor for the National Review, writes in the Chicago Tribune: “After every meeting, participants race to their phones to put their anonymous spin on what happened. The reports read like parody. The Washington Post’s in-depth story on the Comey firing was based on the private accounts of more than 30 officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, as well as Trump confidants and other senior Republicans.” Goldberg chalks up part of the volume of leaks to the fact that not many who are working in the White House now have any prior experience working there which he says contributes to a “shocking lack of internal discipline and clear lines of authority.” Others may be doing it to save their credibility and careers if the whole administration takes a fall. Alan Downs, a clinical psychologist and author of Beyond the Looking Glass, a book about corporate narcissism, believes that when a narcissist rises to leadership and earns the support of codependents, they may profess loyalty to the company but really only care about their own agendas. No matter how charismatic the leader, people eventually figure it out–and quit.  advertisement Maccoby finds that such leaders are rarely empathetic or emotionally intelligent. They aren’t into mentoring and are extremely competitive. Much of what we know about successful leadership is punctuated by the need to have soft skills to engage workers and make them loyal to their vision. Experts offer advice for working with narcissistic bosses including stroking their ego and challenging them carefully. They also suggest staying on the boss’s good side–but know when enough is enough. Those who have bolstered Trump in the aftermath of his disclosures to the Russians haven’t exactly done this. Dina Powell, a deputy national security adviser and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser both called Russian leak story false. Steve Schmidt, a Republican consultant and former campaign manager for John McCain told Politico that they and others who’ve remained loyal to the President have had their credibility “completely shattered.” Schmidt said “Even people who have built up reputations for integrity over a lifetime of public service, they risk squandering it in this administration,” by “lying to the American people on issues big and small.” Their loyalty to him and its potentially negative consequences probably isn’t causing Trump to lose much sleep. We’ve seen how he thrives on pitting people against each other. But how long can a culture of every man and woman for themselves really last?  A leader is only as successful as the team he helms. One who continues to demand loyalty, yet offers no compelling reason to give it would be ousted in the corporate world. Just look at what happened to Steve Jobs. But Jobs wasn’t the President of the United States. It’s imperative that the person who runs the most powerful institution in the world needs to inspire loyalty as well as offer the same to his reports, but he’s also obligated to prove that loyalty to the institution he’s temporarily steering in the world.

Desktops MIA. Andrew Cunningham - May 16, 2017 7:25 pm UTC Enlarge / The 2016 MacBook. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 130 Share this story Further ReadingReview: The 2016 Retina MacBook is a faster version of the same machine A new report from Bloomberg indicates that we may get more than just software updates at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next month. Most notably, both the MacBook Pro and the 12-inch MacBook are supposedly being refreshed with Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" CPUs, which boost clock speeds and include slightly better GPUs that can accelerate the encoding and decoding of some 4K video streams. The 12-inch MacBook was last updated a little over a year ago, while the MacBook Pros were only introduced in October. Apple could also update the MacBook Air design with new processors, since, despite the design's age and non-Retina display, its position as Apple's cheapest laptop is still helping it sell well. The current Air dates to mid-2015. The update would be a bit of a burn for anyone who rushed out to buy a new MacBook Pro in October and November after a year and a half without an update. But an update would at least be a sign that Apple is serious about adopting new Intel architectures as they're available. The MacBook Pro's October refresh was awkwardly timed, coming very late in the Skylake architecture's life but a handful of months before new Kaby Lake CPUs suitable for MacBook Pros would be released. A summer release would get Apple back in sync with Intel's calendar for future refreshes. Further ReadingApple is completely redesigning the Mac Pro… again As always, Apple's plans are subject to change, and, in recent years as Apple's stable of operating systems has grown, WWDC has remained mostly software focused. The last big hardware announcements at WWDC were in 2013, when Apple pre-announced a new Mac Pro and introduced a new MacBook Air refresh alongside a couple of other odds and ends. Rumors have also suggested we could see a new iPad and an Amazon Echo-esque Siri speaker at WWDC, which would be quite a bit of hardware given that we're also likely to see new major releases of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS at the same keynote. Speaking of the Mac Pro, desktops remain conspicuous in their absence from the Bloomberg report. Apple said recently that it is planning a new iMac refresh with professional users in mind as well as an all-new Mac Pro design that rectifies the flaws of the 2013 design, but the company is apparently not ready to talk about either computer. As for the Mac Mini, last updated in October of 2014, Apple recently acknowledged that the device exists but made no definitive statements about its future.

The New York Times, citing a current and a former American official, reported the newest wrinkle in a story that has consumed the Trump administration since Monday night. NBC News also tweeted that government officials say Israel is the partner who supplied the intelligence that Trump shared with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak in a White House meeting last Wednesday. BREAKING: NBC News confirms Israel was partner that provided ISIS-related intelligence shared by the president with Russia, officials say — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 16, 2017 According to The New York Times' anonymous sources, who were not authorized to discuss the matter, Trump shared intelligence about an Islamic State plot, with "at least some of the details" coming from Israel. They also said Israel asked the U.S. to be careful with the same intelligence. Israeli officials would not confirm to The New York Times if they were the source of the information, but Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer gave no indication the report would strain the relationship between the nations. "Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump," Dermer said. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on Tuesday afternoon defended Trump's comments during last week's meeting, which he described as "wholly appropriate." He also said "the president wasn't even aware of where this information came from. He wasn't briefed on the source." In a pair of Tuesday morning tweets, Trump said "as President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety, Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism." As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 ...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 During an off-camera press gaggle Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he couldn't comment on the reports that Israel was the source, but he echoed Dermer's statement. "I am obviously pleased to see Ambassador Demer's comment," he said. "That being said, I am not going to comment any further on that." Trump will visit Israel next week as part of his first overseas trip as president. He is expected to be the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism.

In particular, a spate of strong earnings reports from well-known players like NVIDIA (NVDA – Free Report) , Texas Instruments (TXN – Free Report) , Lam Research Corporation (LRCX – Free Report) , Intel (INTC – Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM – Free Report) instilled confidence in the sector. Let’s dig into the individual performances: Semiconductor Earnings in Focus The graphics chipmaker NVIDIA came up with earnings of 82 cents per share for first-quarter fiscal 2018, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents. Revenues of $1.94 billion are also well ahead of our estimate of $1.91 billion. For fiscal second quarter, NVIDIA expects revenues of approximately $1.95 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $1.893 billion (read: 5 ETFs to Tap the Hot NVIDIA). Texas Instruments reported solid Q1 results topping our earnings estimate by six cents and revenue estimate by $99 million. For the ongoing second quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $3.40–$3.70 billion and earnings per share of $0.89–$1.01. The midpoint of both guidance ranges was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion for revenues and 91 cents for earnings at the time of earnings release. Lam Research also topped on both revenue and earnings for third quarter fiscal 2017. Earnings per share of $2.80 strongly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents while revenues of $2.15 billion edged past our estimated $2.13 billion. For fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.2–$2.4 billion and earnings per share of $2.88–$3.13 (read: Will Chip ETFs Continue Their Solid Run As Q1 Unfolds?). Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, beat our earnings estimates by a penny while missed our revenue estimate by $12 million. Going forward, Intel expects revenues in the range of $13.9–$14.9 billion and earnings per share of 63–73 cents for the second quarter of 2017. The midpoint was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.30 billion for revenues and 64 cents for earnings per share at the time of the earnings release. For 2017, the company expects revenues of almost $60 billion compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $59.82 billion at the time of earnings release. Additionally, the earnings per share guidance has been revised upward to $2.80–$2.90 from $2.75–$2.85. At Qualcomm, earnings per share of $1.20 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) surpassed our estimate of $1.05 while revenues of $5.0 billion fell short of our estimate of $5.88 billion. The company guided revenues of $5.3–$6.1 billion and earnings per share of $0.90–$1.15 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The midpoint of both the guidance ranges is much above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate $5.27 billion for revenues and 68 cents for earnings.

The company will refresh the MacBook Pro with new seventh-gen processors from Intel, the newest available, according to Bloomberg. Apple launched the device last November with older sixth-generation chips, which means folks who already own the newer model may be a bit dismayed by Apple's refresh. The company will also update the 12-inch MacBook, the thin-and-light notebook Apple has been selling for a couple of years now. That's also expected to get Intel's newest chips. Bloomberg said Apple has been considering updating the 13-inch MacBook Air but it isn't clear if the company plans to unveil it just yet. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The MacBook Air hasn't been refreshed with a sharper display, one of the most requested upgrades, and appears to be slowly making its way to the grave. If Apple refreshes it, however, that means it plans to offer the laptop for the foreseeable future. If it doesn't, then the MacBook is likely to take its place. Apple's Mac lineup has seen a long-awaited refresh over the past year, with the MacBook Pro adding the new TouchBar feature. But while the company makes most of its money from the iPhone, Apple has also faced pressure to do more with its computer lineup.

Many rumors floated around at that point in time, some claimed that a new license was being negotiated, others suggested that Intel and AMD were in discussions about a possible agreement. If a new report is believed, Intel and AMD have inked an agreement and that Intel is now licensing graphics technology from AMD. Fudzilla reports that Intel has decided not go with NVIDIA this time around and that it has now started paying licensing fees to AMD for its graphics technology. No further details have been provided about this agreement between the two companies. An official announcement has not been made by either Intel or AMD. Intel didn’t say before how much its licensing deal with NVIDIA cost but the deal was believed to cost as much as $200 million. It’s unclear at this point in time if it’s paying AMD more or less than what it was believed to be paying NVIDIA for its graphics technology. A spokesperson for AMD denied to confirm the deal but did mention that the company’s management may talk about the matter during AMD’s analyst day event later today. So if this has really happened, we can expect the official word to come through today. Filed in Computers. Read more about AMD, Intel and NVIDIA.

Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Hooks In VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 Support Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 16 May 2017 at 01:06 PM EDT. Add A Comment Just days after the release of Vulkan 1.0.49, Intel's ANV Linux Vulkan driver developers have landed support for one of the new extensions. VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 is the new extension now supported in Mesa Git for this open-source Vulkan driver. The VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2 extension adds a new method of querying the device surface capabilities in an extensible-friendly manner. Vulkan 1.0.49 also added the VK_KHR_shared_presentable_image extension, but as of writing that isn't supported in Mesa Git. Today's ANV Mesa commits also included updating the headers for Vulkan 1.0.49 as well as the WSI bits for Wayland and X11 needed for the surface_capabilities2 extension, so some of the lifting is already done for when RADV works on its implementation. All in the ANV commits for adding this extension were just about 100 lines of code.

De Joule compute module is in twee smaken beschikbaar, namelijk de 550x en 570x. De 550x heeft een 1,5GHz-cpu, 300MHz-gpu en 3GB werkgeheugen met 8GB emmc-flashopslag. De 570x heeft een 1,7GHz-cpu met een turboboost tot 2,4GHz, 450MHz-gpu met een 600MHz-Turbo en 4GB werkgeheugen met 16GB emmc-flashopslag. Voor meer informatie verwijzen we jullie door naar de datasheet. De lijst met aanpassingen voor deze uitgave ziet er als volgt uit: BIOS Version #1F1: Fix EEPROM binary won't validate, ever. Fix UART S0ix programming in EEPROM default image. Setup Type-C PD negotiations for Type-C PD chargers Fix Flash.bat so it will accept a full path for the DNX IFWI binary Fixed incorrect CPU frequency value in BIOS setup and MIG OS both - This was caused by saving data to the wrong PlatformInfo data structure pointer Added a board check to the EEPROM code so it only runs on 570x/550x Added code to tell the end-user what version of the EEPROM binary is being used Added code to force using the BIOS EEPROM defaults if the GP button is pressed during POST Added NVMe into the boot order. New boot order is: uSD, eMMC, NVMe, USB, PXE, Shell Added VBT into the EEPROM image. Add PXE boot and i210 networking stack to Joule BIOS Confirmed that PXE boot works with a UEFI PXE server Set BDS boot priority to uSD, eMMC, USB, Network, Shell Known Issues: The PMIC_PWRGOOD signal contains an ~20uS wide, low going pulse, which may result in unexpected behavior on some custom designed expansion/carrier boards.

Angus King Suggests Impeachment on Table for Trump Due to Potential 'Obstruction of Justice' Jake Tapper: CNN Was Asked Not to Reveal Info That Trump Reportedly Revealed to Russians 'One Serving of Impeachment, Please': Twitter Reacts to Reports That Trump Asked Comey to Drop Flynn Investigation Shep Smith: Trump's Classified Info Issue 'Potentially Far More Dangerous' Than Anything Hillary Did Too Much Winning Chuck Schumer Demands Transcript of Trump’s Conversation with Russian Officials by Aidan McLaughlin | 11:55 am, May 16th, 2017   .@SenSchumer calls on White House to “immediately” provide transcript of meeting between Trump and Russian officials to Intel committees. pic.twitter.com/QOLjpy5ke8 — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 16, 2017 In the wake of bombshell reports that President Donald Trump revealed classified information to Russian officials, Democratic lawmakers — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — have begun calling for transcripts of the meeting to be released. “I am calling on the White House to make the transcript of the meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador available to the Congressional Intelligence Committees as soon as possible,” Schumer said Tuesday in a statement on the Senate floor. Trump made the controversial comments during last week’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The White House has contested the reports, and national security advisor H.R. McMaster issued a full denial of the story “as reported” claiming that, “at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed.” Trump contradicted McMaster Tuesday morning in a series of Tweets, in which he admitted to sharing the information, but defended doing so as necessary for “Humanitarian reasons.” In light of the cloud of confusion surrounding the story, Schumer called for the White House release a full transcript of the meeting and demanded a briefing to be called “immediately.” The White House should make the transcript of @POTUS‘ mtg w/ the Russian Foreign Minister & Ambassador available to Intel Cmtes ASAP — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 16, 2017 Schumer’s demands for a transcript come as pressure mounts on the White House to clarify what exactly was divulged in the meeting.

 Sponsor Content 8 things you need to know about augmented reality and mixed reality Sponsor Content by Dell Technologies and Intel® May 16, 2017, 10:00 AM facebook linkedin twitter email print This post is sponsored by Dell Technologies and Intel® – partners in digital transformation. Intel Inside®. Powerful Productivity Outside. Learn more at delltechnologies.com.  Interact with technology more intuitivelyGetty Virtual reality has received a lot of attention, but it is augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies which will really enhance our capabilities in the real world and allow us to interact with technology more intuitively. Both technologies have clear applications for the future workplace, as we have seen at CES 2017 — from the smart glasses by Vuzix and ODG to the much-discussed Microsoft Hololens headset, which will allow you to interact with holograms around you. Here are a few things to know about both of these technologies. Augmented reality AR overlays virtual or synthetic elements onto the real world, whereas virtual reality is immersion in a virtual world. AR allows users to stay in the real world while maintaining connectivity to the Internet and a host of AR-enabled applications and services. Employees on the factory floor need to be present and engaged in the factory, not in a virtual world, but traditional computing technology is difficult to use while performing other tasks. AR allows employees to use the computer without constraining their hands. It can be used in any position such as horizontal under a car, standing, or traveling. That is the beauty of AR. It applies technology to what we are already doing, and it does so in a way that is natural for end users.  In fact, 77% of millennials and 47% of baby boomers would be willing to use AR in professional life, according to the Dell and Intel Future Workforce Study.   AR will support and enhance our business operations. Liam Quinn, CTO at Dell explains how AR can transform the workplace. Primarily, AR will free up our hands so that we can work in our environment unhindered and yet still connected. AR makes it easier to obtain support because a remote technician can see what you see and work with you on a more personal basis. It is also extremely valuable for training. Instructions or demonstrations can be overlaid onto real life while a task is performed.    There is a multitude of opportunities within AR. With AR, you can get an x-ray view of hardware from internal sensors or overlay infrared heat signatures onto a regular field of view. GPS data can be viewed while walking to a destination or contact details retrieved based on facial recognition when seeing someone.   Mixed reality MR is a similar concept to AR with some key differences. AR overlays content onto the world around us, but that content is not something the user interacts with. It is primarily informational. MR, however, allows for interactivity between real and virtual components. This is especially relevant with the increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) because these Internet-connected devices can then be manipulated through MR.   Data from the machines around a person can be displayed on their MR gear. For example, a worker in a pump station could see the pressure levels of pipes at different places around the pump house. He or she could make flow changes to compensate using MR while still looking around the pump house rather than going to a computer console.   Security solutions could be implemented with MR. For example, an entry door may be equipped with a camera. When a user approaches the door, their MR gear displays several pictures to them. They swipe through the ones that form their password in the appropriate order to gain entrance. The camera observes the swipes and knows which places should be swiped because it is interfacing with the MR gear. The same user approaching later would receive a set of pictures in different locations.   MR allows users to create content. Paint with virtual brushes, manipulate 3D objects that you can walk around and view from multiple perspectives, or collaborate around a shared virtual table that each person experiences in their own location.   As you can see, AR and MR can bridge the gap between how we interact with the real world and how we utilize technology. They are the next step in human computer interaction, and they are poised to change the way we work and do business.  This post was authored by Eric Vanderburg, a security and technology leader, author, speaker and member of Dell’s influencer program.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria    What Republicans Are Saying About Reports Trump Shared Secret Intel With The Russians Phillip Stucky 10:52 AM 05/16/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Republican Senators responded to reports Monday President Donald Trump allegedly shared highly classified information with the Russians in a recent meeting. “The White House has got to do something soon to bring itself under control and in order,” Sen. Bob Corker said in a press statement. “It’s got to happen … Obviously, they’re in a downward spiral right now and they’ve got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening. To compromise a source is something that you just don’t do.” Sen. John McCain asserted that the information was “disturbing,” but also reaffirmed the fact that the president has the legal right to reveal any information he chooses. “We certainly don’t want any president to leak classified information but the president does have the right to do that,” he said. “If it’s accurate, it’d be troubling,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said about the possibility that Trump released classified information. The reports from The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Reuters and others are based on anonymous U.S. officials. The Trump administration has denied he shared “sources” or “methods” with the Russians in the meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, although Trump defended his right to share sensitive information in a series of tweets. Sen. Marco Rubio declined to comment, saying that he hadn’t seen the story yet. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said that he wanted a “full explanation” of the facts of the matter from the White House directly. “We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation’s secrets is paramount,” Ryan’s spokesperson said. “The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.”   Follow Phillip On Twitter Have a Tip?

Russia strongly rebuffed U.S. criticism of its air strikes in Syria on Tuesday, reminding Washington how it had supported the United States in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on New York in 2001. (PHOTO: REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov)    Russia Responds To Trump Intel Disclosure: ‘Don’t Read US Newspapers’ Will Racke 10:33 AM 05/16/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Americans should avoid reading U.S. newspapers if they want to understand what happened during a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian officials. Maria Zakharova described reports of Trump sharing classified information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as “yet another fake,” the Associated Press reported. Zakharova also encouraged Americans to do anything with newspapers but read them. “Guys, have you been reading American newspapers again?” she wrote on her Facebook page. “You shouldn’t read them. You can put them to various uses, but you shouldn’t read them. Lately it’s become not only harmful, but dangerous too.” Zakharova’s remarks come in response to a bombshell report from the Washington Post, later confirmed by several other U.S. outlets, that Trump passed highly sensitive, “code word” national security information to Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during a meeting in the Oval Office. Trump allegedly told the Russian officials about a planned ISIS plot against commercial aviation, and the location where US allies came upon this information, the Post reported. (RELATED: Trump Revealed Top-Secret Anti-ISIS Intel To Russian Officials) The White House denied the allegations on Monday evening, with National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster issuing a carefully worded statement saying “the story that came out tonight as reported is false.” “At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known,” McMaster added. Trump later acknowledged in a pair of tweets that he did in fact share information during the meeting. He said he did so on “humanitarian” grounds and mutual concerns over the threat of terrorism. The tweets appeared to contradict Zakharova’s characterization of media reports as “fake” news. “As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,” Trump wrote Tuesday morning. “Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.” Follow Will on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Trump, the laptop ban,and Russian officials By Li Zhou 05/16/17 10:00 AM EDT Updated 05/16/17 06:00 AM EDT 2017-05-16T06:00-0400 With help from Ashley Gold ABOUT THAT LAPTOP BAN — From the bombshell Washington Post report that said President Trump revealed highly classified information: “One day after dismissing [FBI Director James] Comey, Trump welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — a key figure in earlier Russia controversies — into the Oval Office. It was during that meeting, officials said, that Trump went off script and began describing details of an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.” Story Continued Below — “Trump also described measures the United States has taken or is contemplating to counter the threat, including military operations in Iraq and Syria, as well as other steps to tighten security, officials said. The officials would not discuss details of those measures, but the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed that it is considering banning laptops and other large electronic devices from carry-on bags on flights between Europe and the United States.” — “The White House went into fresh damage control mode on Monday, pushing back against a Washington Post report that Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador last week, the latest scandal to engulf the embattled White House,” POLITICO reports. “The story that came out tonight as reported is false,” national security adviser H.R. McMaster said. POLITICO’s Bryan Bender also has reactions from intelligence experts and former government security officials of both parties, who note that Trump’s allegedly loose lips with the Russians could have caused serious damage to U.S. efforts to counter the Islamic State. USPTO DIRECTOR TAKES THE STAGE AT GW — Patent Office boss Michelle Lee is the keynote speaker at this morning's Intellectual Property Law Symposium at the George Washington University Law School. What MT's looking for: If Lee shares preliminary results from her review of the functioning of the controversial Patent Trial and Appeal Board – like data on how often issued patents are finding themselves poked and prodded by the court's judges. Lee kicked off the PTAB review last month, and the Foggy Bottom session’s an early opportunity for others in the patent world to hear how it's going. Here's the day's agenda. IA’S WISH LIST FOR LIGHTHIZER — The Internet Association, which counts Facebook, Google and Twitter among its members, is outlining its priorities to newly minted U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Topping the list: more detailed guidelines for cross-border data flows and increased flexibility around data localization restrictions. The group says there’s also a need for a chief digital trade negotiator or other senior official to serve as a point person overseeing this specific policy area. “Staff at USTR currently dedicated to addressing barriers to digital trade is not commensurate with the importance of our sector to the overall U.S. economy,” IA writes.

WHITE HOUSE’S APPLE SHOUT-OUT — Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday highlighted recent investments from companies like Intel and Apple as a sign of broader “optimism” resulting from the economic policies of the Trump administration. “The president is also glad to see businesses once again making significant investments in America,” Spicer said. “From Intel to General Motors to Walmart to Apple — who specifically just announced earlier this month they will start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs here in the United States.” Apple awarded the first $200 million from this fund to Corning Glass last Friday. ** A message from Qualcomm: The smartphone revolution didn’t happen by accident. Qualcomm invented the technology and business model to scale cutting edge performance throughout the industry for everyone, everywhere.

The ruling is a blow to Uber as it battles with Google to lead the self-driving car race. U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote that Uber knew--or should have known--that Levandowski, who used to work for Waymo, had taken files possibly containing trade secrets and that Waymo intellectual property “seeped into” Uber’s self-driving project. — Snap back: Snap shares were trading higher on Monday after big-name funds including Fidelity Management and Research, Coatue Management and Jennison revealed the size of their stakes in the company, Bloomberg reports. The company saw significant declines in share price following a disappointing earnings call last week that revealed underwhelming user growth and significant revenue losses. — Gates’ graduation advice: In a tweetstorm of advice he shared for recent college graduates, Microsoft founder Bill Gates emphasized the need to learn about and tackle inequality at an early age, Recode reports. “AI, energy, and biosciences are promising fields where you can make a huge impact. It's what I would do if starting out today,” he wrote. “You can start fighting inequity, whether down the street or around the world, sooner.” As of Monday afternoon, “The Better Angels of Our Nature,” a book Gates recommended for graduates, had surged 6,000 percent in the sales rankings on Amazon compared to the previous 24 hours, The Washington Post reports. MEANWHILE, IN EUROPE — — May’s Facebook Live fail: U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May participated in her first Facebook Live Q&A and things didn’t exactly go as planned, The Daily Beast reports. The video feed was bombarded with angry emoji and questions, and her opponent Jeremy Corbyn even chimed into the comments and called May out for refusing to debate him. The U.K. general election is set for early June. CEI MAKES CASE FOR NET NEUTRALITY ROLLBACK — The Competitive Enterprise Institute, in a report out this morning, argues that the current net neutrality rules hurt broadband investment and reduce innovation. “The FCC’s net neutrality rules are the opposite of what American consumers want and need online and there is little evidence of the harms these regulations claim to prevent,” CEI Research Fellow and Regulatory Counsel Ryan Radia writes. “If the FCC rule is left intact, it will prevent you from getting free stuff like sponsored data from your wireless provider. Just think, if you like unlimited HBO with your AT&T plan or unlimited music streaming from T-Mobile, then you should demand that these net neutrality regulations be eliminated.” TRANSITIONS — Lyndon Rive, founder of SolarCity, is leaving Tesla, per Reuters. QUICK DOWNLOADS AMC, BBC America join YouTube TV: Other AMC Networks channels that were added to the streaming service include IFC, Sundance TV and WE TV, The Verge reports. Facebook tightens restrictions on live video: “The company tells TechCrunch that it’s adding a section to its Live API Facebook Platform Policy that reads ‘Don’t use the API to publish only images (ex: don’t publish static, animated, or looping images), or to live-stream polls associated with unmoving or ambient broadcasts.’” Trump’s many cyber vacancies as malware attack hit: “The global malware attack that has crippled hospitals, businesses and foreign government computers is confronting a Trump administration that still hasn’t filled many of the top cybersecurity slots that are critical for handling this kind of crisis,” Pro Cybersecurity Tim Starks reports.

If accurate this summer Intel will launch a new processor that sounds as if it might be the performance king for the foreseeable future. The top of the line CPU in the leak is said to be the Core i9-7920X 12-core unit reports TechCrunch. The chip will have power consumption of 140W and a poster on Anandtech claims that the chip will be able to run 24 threads and have 16.5MB of L3 cache and 44 PCIe lanes. The clock speeds aren’t mentioned in the leak for that high-end processor. Word is that some of the new processors, and there are a handful of them, will support Turbo 3.0. Turbo 3.0 is said to be a faster frequency boosting mode for single threaded tasks. There is no indication on pricing, but expect this 12-core beast to be very expensive. That high-end Core i9 part won’t ship until August, but the other processors on the list will land mostly in June. Other chips listed on the Anandtech forum leak include a 10-core Core i9-7900X running at 3.3GHz base, 4.3GHz turbo 2.0, and 4.5GHz turbo 3.0. A Core i9-7820X 8-core unit running at 3.5GHz base, Core i9-7800X 6-core running at 3.5GHz base and lacking turbo 3.0, Core i7-7740K quad core at 4.3GHz base, and a Core i7-7640K running at 4.0GHz. Ghis1964 Looks like some heat has “rysen” up through intel’s ass LOL 😉 Zach B. Due to the mixed results of the R5 and R7 cpus against i5 CPUs. This is more likely to compete with the upcoming R9 cpus from AMD that are expected to compete with the i7 CPUs. Intel hasn’t lost its overall performance crown for well over a decade now, doesn’t seem they want to start losing that just yet!

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Is UEFI, and How Is It Different from BIOS? By Chris Hoffman on May 16th, 2017 New computers use UEFI firmware instead of the traditional BIOS. Both are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system, but UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors. We’ve seen newer PCs that ship with UEFI still refer to it as the “BIOS” to avoid confusing people who are used to a traditional PC BIOS. Even if your PC uses the term “BIOS”, modern PCs you buy today almost certainly ship with UEFI firmware instead of a BIOS. What Is a BIOS? RELATED ARTICLE What Does a PC’s BIOS Do, and When Should I Use It? BIOS is short for Basic Input-Output system. It’s low-level software that resides in a chip on your computer’s motherboard. The BIOS loads when your computer starts up, and the BIOS is responsible for waking up your computer’s hardware components, ensures they’re functioning properly, and then runs the bootloader that boots Windows or whatever other operating system you have installed. You can configure various settings in the BIOS setup screen. Settings like your computer’s hardware configuration, system time, and boot order are located here. You can access this screen by pressing a specific key—different on different computers, but often Esc, F2, F10, or Delete—while the computer boots. When you save a setting, it’s saved to the memory on your motherboard itself. When you boot your computer, the BIOS will configure your PC with the saved settings. The BIOS goes through a POST, or Power-On Self Test, before booting your operating system. It checks to ensure your hardware configuration is valid and working properly. If something is wrong, you’ll see an error message or hear a cryptic series of beep codes. You’ll have to look up what different sequences of beeps mean in the computer’s manual. When your computer boots—and after the POST finishes—the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record, or MBR, stored on the boot device and uses it to launch the bootloader. You may also see the acronym CMOS, which stands for Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor. This refers to the battery-backed memory where the BIOS stores various settings on the motherboard. It’s actually not accurate anymore, since this method has been replaced with flash memory (also referred to as EEPROM) in contemporary systems. Why the BIOS Is Outdated The BIOS has been around for a long time, and hasn’t evolved much. Even MS-DOS PCs released in the 1980s had a BIOS! Of course, the BIOS has evolved and improved over time. Some extensions were developed, including ACPI, the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. This allows the BIOS to more easily configure devices and perform advanced power management functions, like sleep. But the BIOS hasn’t advanced and improved nearly as much as other PC technology has since the days of MS-DOS. The traditional BIOS still has serious limitations. It can only boot from drives of 2.1 TB or less. 3 TB drives are now common, and a computer with a BIOS can’t boot from them. That limitation is due to the way the BIOS’s Master Boot Record system works. The BIOS must run in 16-bit processor mode, and only has 1 MB of space to execute in. It has trouble initializing multiple hardware devices at once, which leads to a slower boot process when initializing all the hardware interfaces and devices on a modern PC. The BIOS has needed replacement for a long time. Intel started work on the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification back in 1998. Apple chose EFI when it switched to the Intel architecture on its Macs in 2006, but other PC manufacturers didn’t follow. In 2007, Intel, AMD, Microsoft, and PC manufacturers agreed on a new Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification. This is an industry-wide standard managed by the Unified Extended Firmware Interface Forum, and isn’t solely driven by Intel. UEFI support was introduced to Windows with Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows 7. The vast majority of computers you can buy today now use UEFI rather than a traditional BIOS. How UEFI Replaces and Improves on the BIOS UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS on PCs. There’s no way to switch from BIOS to UEFI on an existing PC. You need to buy new hardware that supports and includes UEFI, as most new computers do. Most UEFI implementations provide BIOS emulation so you can choose to install and boot old operating systems that expect a BIOS instead of UEFI, so they’re backwards compatible. RELATED ARTICLE What’s the Difference Between GPT and MBR When Partitioning a Drive? This new standard avoids the limitations of the BIOS. The UEFI firmware can boot from drives of 2.2 TB or larger—in fact, the theoretical limit is 9.4 zettabytes. That’s roughly three times the estimated size of all the data on the Internet. That’s because UEFI uses the GPT partitioning scheme instead of MBR. It also boots in a more standardized way, launching EFI executables rather than running code from a drive’s master boot record. UEFI can run in 32-bit or 64-bit mode and has more addressable address space than BIOS, which means your boot process is faster. It also means that UEFI setup screens can be slicker than BIOS settings screens, including graphics and mouse cursor support. However, this isn’t mandatory. Many PCs still ship with text-mode UEFI settings interfaces that look and work like an old BIOS setup screen. UEFI is packed with other features. It supports Secure Boot, which means the operating system can be checked for validity to ensure no malware has tampered with the boot process. It can support networking features right in the UEFI firmware itself, which can aid in remote troubleshooting and configuration. With a traditional BIOS, you have to be sitting in front of a physical computer to configure it. It’s not just a BIOS replacement, either. UEFI is essentially a tiny operating system that runs on top of the PC’s firmware, and it can do a lot more than a BIOS. It may be stored in flash memory on the motherboard, or it may be loaded from a hard drive or network share at boot. Different PCs with UEFI will have different interfaces and features. It’s all up to your PC manufacturer, but the basics will be the same on each PC. How to Access UEFI Settings on Modern PCs If you’re a normal PC user, switching to a computer with UEFI won’t be a noticeable change. Your new computer will boot up and shut down faster than it would have with a BIOS, and you can use drives of 2.2 TB or more in size. RELATED ARTICLE Three Ways to Access the Windows 8 or 10 Boot Options Menu If you need to access low-level settings, there may be a slight difference. You may need to access the UEFI settings screen through the Windows boot options menu rather than pressing a key while your computer starts. With PCs now booting so quickly, PC manufacturers don’t want to slow down the boot process by waiting to see if you press a key. However, we’ve also seen PCs with UEFI that allow you to access the BIOS in the same way, by pressing a key during the boot-up process. While UEFI is a big upgrade, it’s largely in the background. Most PC users will never notice—or need to care—that their new PCs use UEFI instead of a traditional BIOS. They’ll just work better and support more modern hardware and features.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) DETROIT (AP) — Automotive parts and electronics maker Delphi Corp. has joined with BMW, Intel and Mobileye to develop the building blocks of autonomous vehicles. It's the latest in a flurry of partnerships between automakers, tech companies, parts suppliers and ride-hailing services as they race to build robot-controlled vehicles. The companies announced Tuesday that Delphi will help to integrate autonomous driving systems. BMW, Intel and Mobileye joined forces in July of 2016. They plan to start producing automated vehicle systems by 2021, and BMW plans to have an autonomous vehicle on the road by then. It would be capable of driving itself, but a human driver could still be called on to intervene. The companies say Delphi, with U.S. operations based in suburban Detroit, already has provided a prototype computing platform that melds sensors, artificial intelligence and other computers. The system won't go into just BMWs, though. The companies plan to develop a system that can be used by other automakers or tech companies in their own cars. The partners will decide each company's role in the partnership, as well as the financial arrangements, in coming months. More partners could be added to the group, including other automakers. Delphi would be in charge of integrating the system into other automakers' vehicles. During a conference call with reporters to discuss the partnership, executives from the four companies said alliances like theirs will become more common in the future as partners try to share costs and expertise. Richard Rau, BMW AG's vice president of sensors, control units and software, said his company believes autonomous driving platforms will be consolidated over time as more companies join forces. "In the long run there will be only a few platforms left," he said. Delphi now produces electrical wiring architecture, computing platforms and autonomous driving software. Mobileye, of Israel, makes software that integrates cameras, radar and other sensors and offers artificial intelligence and mapping. Intel has computing hardware and data centers and mapping that will help cars make decisions, while BMW makes autos and has its own autonomous car technology.

The system won’t go into just BMWs, though. The companies plan to develop a system that can be used by other automakers or tech companies in their own cars.

More partners could be added to the group, including other automakers. Delphi would be in charge of integrating the system into other automakers’ vehicles. During a conference call with reporters to discuss the partnership, executives from the four companies said alliances like theirs will become more common in the future as partners try to share costs and expertise. Richard Rau, BMW AG’s vice president of sensors, control units and software, said his company believes autonomous driving platforms will be consolidated over time as more companies join forces. “In the long run there will be only a few platforms left,” he said. Delphi now produces electrical wiring architecture, computing platforms and autonomous driving software. Mobileye, of Israel, makes software that integrates cameras, radar and other sensors and offers artificial intelligence and mapping. Intel has computing hardware and data centers and mapping that will help cars make decisions, while BMW makes autos and has its own autonomous car technology. Such partnerships seem to be announced almost every day as companies frenetically race to be first with the new technology that has the potential to reduce crashes, save lives and change how we all get around. In the past two months, auto software and parts maker Bosch announced it was joining with Daimler, maker of Mercedes-Benz, to work on autonomous cars. Toyota teamed with artificial intelligence company NVIDIA and Waymo, formerly Google’s autonomous car division, partnered with ride-hailing service Lyft. Congress finds family life at the root of military personnel issues In March, Intel Corp. announced it will spend more than $15 billion to acquire Mobileye NV.

Truth be told though we have not seen a new APU in years. If Summit Ridge rumors are true, then we will see some good performance coming out of their igpu's soon enough. But even if the hardware is capable Intel compared to AMD, drivers for IGPU on the Intel side are horrible.     vbetts View Public Profile Find all posts by vbetts   (#11) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930K 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-AU31 Memory: G.Skill 32GB 3200C12 Soundcard: ASUS Phoebus PSU: EVGA P2-1200W Yesterday, 18:29 | posts: 9,226 | Location: USA Not gonna happen.

As for what the licensing agreement means - this is what Anandtech wrote about the original agreement when Nvidia won the court case with Intel: Quote: Update: While we're still working on our full rundown of the agreement, there's been some speculation over at Ars Technica about what this agreement means for Intel; specifically claiming that NVIDIA GPUs will be appearing in Intel CPUs, on the basis of the fact that Intel is licensing NVIDIA technology. I'm not a lawyer (though I do play one on the Internet) however I disagree with this reading - Intel has to license NVIDIA technology to avoid running afoul of the company's large patent portfolio with their own IGPs. It's for all practical purposes impossible to build a desktop GPU without infringing on an AMD/NV patent. This agreement allows Intel to continue producing their IGPs, just as how the original 2004 chipset agreement allowed Intel to produce more modern IGPs in return for NVIDIA getting a chipset license. -Ryan Smith http://www.anandtech.com/show/4121/t...dia-15-billion I bolded the important parts. I remember the ars article when everyone was claiming similar things to what they are with the AMD agreement.. that Intel would be integrating Nvidia GPU's into their processors. Obviously that didn't happen and I don't think we'll see AMD GPUs in Intel processors either.

With that out of the way, onto the deals! Microsoft Store The Microsoft Store will be having a 60% sale from 7:00PM AEST, although some of the discounts are already live.

But it's not a good look 16 May 2017 at 07:27, Simon Sharwood IBM's pension fund has sold most of its shares in IBM. The fund's February 2017 SEC filing records it as holding 82,802 shares. But the May 2017 filing records a reduced holding of 12,451 shares. Selling shares isn't unusual for a pension fund as dividends alone can't always provide such entities with the cash they need to pay the pensions they exist to provide. Indeed, the filings also show that the fund let go of plenty Intel, Microsoft and Apple shares during the first quarter of 2017. The fund also got out of lots of share completely: by our count it quit over 100 companies in the quarter. So perhaps this is a shift in investment strategy that will benefit pension recipients. But the fund's divestment is still a bad look for two reasons. Firstly, IBM's pension fund deciding that holding IBM stock isn't the best way to meet its obligations is hardly a vote of confidence in the company's future. Or a vote of confidence in the tech sector in general. Second, the pension fund is not the only company worried about Big Blue's prospects. Also in Q1, widely-admired investor Warren Buffet recently shed most of his IBM stock after reportedly souring on Big Blue's prospects. Buffet is thought to worry that for all of IBM's impressive dividend-paying powers, its long string of quarterly revenue reductions doesn't exactly suggest its planned cloud-and-AI-fuelled rebound is imminent. ® Tips and corrections 23 Comments MORE IBM Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register IBM wheels out bleedin' big 15TB tape drive Proprietary tape format bits shrink while capacity bulks up 23 Comments HPE tops in tape.

Longtime rival AMD is hard at work on a new line of CPUs that’ll bring its Zen architecture to the high-end desktop market and thanks to a new leak, we’ve got the skinny on the entire Ryzen 9 “Threadripper” lineup. Starting at the bottom and working our way up, we have the Ryzen 9 1955 and 1955X. These are 10-core (20-thread) chips with base / boost clocks of 3.1GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.6GHz / 4.0GHz, respectively, with TDPs of 125W. Climbing one step up the ladder, you’ll find the Ryzen 9 1956 and 1956X. These 12-core (24-thread) processors offer respective base / boost clocks of 3.0GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.2GHz / 3.8GHz with the same 125 watt power ratings. Name Cores/ Threads Base clock/ Boost (GHz) PCIe Lanes Memory TDP 1998X 16/32 3.5 / 3.9 44 Quad Channel DDR4 155W 1998 16/32 3.2 / 3.6 44 Quad Channel DDR4 155W 1977X 14/28 3.5 / 4.0 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1977 14/28 3.2 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1976X 14/28 3.6 / 4.1 44 Quad Channel DDR4 140W 1956X 12/24 3.2 / 3.8 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1956 12/24 3.0 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1955X 10/20 3.6 / 4.0 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W 1955 10/20 3.1 / 3.7 44 Quad Channel DDR4 125W One step further forward is the 1976X, the 1977 and the 1977X. This tier offers 14 cores with 28 threads and base / boost clock speeds of 3.6GHz / 4.1GHz, 3.2GHz / 3.7GHz and 3.5GHz / 4.0GHz, respectively. The 1976X and 1977 carry TDPs of 140W while the 1977X is slightly higher at 155W. The crowning jewel of AMD’s upcoming enthusiast lineup is the Ryzen 9 1998 and 1998X, 16-core (32-thread) monsters with a base / boost clock of 3.2GHz / 3.6GHz and 3.5GHz / 3.9GHz, respectively. Both of these chips have 155W TDPs, as you might have guessed. All chips support quad-channel DDR4 and offer up 44 PCIe lanes. They’ll fit into a modified version of the SP3 socket (originally designed for AMD’s 32-core Naples server parts) called the SP3r2. The new platform is codenamed Whitehaven.

A typical data center setup. (Courtesy: Wikipedia) Nutanix plans to release a line of server appliances with IBM’s Power processor for artificial-intelligence applications, the first time it has shipped one of its data center bundles with anything but Intel inside. Nutanix sells a package of hardware and software to companies looking to manage their own data centers, and Fortune reports that it has decided for the first time to include appliances based on Power as part of those packages. IBM has been pushing Power as uniquely suited for AI or machine learning applications, given that it runs its Watson service on the chips. Nvidia is probably the first chipmaker AI researchers think of when building a new system. The graphics company has adapted nicely to the growing demand for powerful chips to train AI: GPUs (graphical processing units) excel at processing a relatively simple task over and over again, which is ideal for training AI systems, and IBM is actually using some of Nvidia’s chips inside its own public cloud service. Still, this is very new territory, and there’s lots of time for other companies to find a niche. Intel acquired Nervana last summer to address this area, and IBM is hoping its Watson experience will move a few Power chips. There could also be some more movement later this year on the idea of Power in cloud data centers, where Intel dominates. The Register noted Monday that Nutanix has invited Google Cloud Platform boss Diane Greene to speak at its yearly conference this summer. Google is the most prominent supporter of the OpenPower movement (which also includes Nvidia), and confirmed last year that it is running some of its public cloud infrastructure on IBM’s chips. This could mean (as The Register speculated) that Google is striking a hybrid cloud partnership with Nutanix, with Power processors playing some role in the package. You had to expect that the public cloud providers would do something to try and keep Intel on its toes in this market. It was long believed that Amazon Web Services and others would focus on designing their own chips around the ARM instruction set, which Microsoft has discussed in some detail, but Power processors are available now and backed by a rather large company.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement AMD Ryzen 9 chip details leaked 05/15/2017 at 12:04 PM by Brad Linder 11 Comments Intel may not be the only company preparing to launch a line of high-performance processors with the number 9 in the name (to indicate that they’re better than chips with the number 7 in the name). AMD is rumored to be working on high-power Ryzen 9 desktop chips with up to 16 CPU cores. The processors would join the company’s recently launched Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 chips for premium and mainstream desktops, and the upcoming Ryzen 3 processors for entry-level systems. If the latest leaks are accurate, AMD’s Ryzen 9 1998X will be the company’s new top-of-the-line desktop processor. It’s a 16-core CPU with support for hyperthreading for up to 32 simultaneous processor threads. Each CPU core has a base clock speed of 3.5 GHz and boost speeds of up to 3.9 GHz, and like other Ryzen processors, the new chip should be unlocked, which means enthusiasts can try to overclock the processor for higher performance. Don’t expect this chip to show up in notebooks anytime soon: it’s a 155 watt processor. Other members of the upcoming Ryzen 9 family are said to include 125 watt 10-core and 12-core chips, and 140 watt processors with 14 CPU cores. For more analysis on how AMD’s upcoming chips compare to Intel’s rumored Core i9 Skylake processors, at least on paper, check out wccftech. via TechPowerUp Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 11 Comments on "AMD Ryzen 9 chip details leaked" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member jakky567 Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I like the idea of increasing CPU cores as a path for the future, in theory. But until things change so that basically any program can properly take advantage of parallel processing, these kinds of chips will remain niche.

For example, many of us live in Notepad++ or a browser. I see I have 3 Firefox.exe processes running right now, and 120 tabs open. And I often run other processes, such as Windows Media Center, at the same time. So a multi-core processor might be a good choice for me and others, even if apps I don’t use, or use only occasionally, cannot take advantage of available cores.

I think you’ve hit the nail on the head, and any sort of future-proofing will require more cores. Programmers have been generally slow to adopt multithreaded approaches, but multitasking is growing as schedulers get better and better at balancing loads. Yeah, you probably won’t see 10+ cores in regular consumer devices too soon (my enthusiast-y, “prosumer” build only has 6 cores), but I would love to get my VMs on something like this.

AMD is definitely not trying to bring 16-core CPUs to the mainstream (at least not yet ;)). As for app support, Intel’s pricing strategy has so far limited 6, 8 and 10-core processors to deep-pocketed enthusiasts and prosumers, meaning there was little incentive for app and game developers to optimize for more cores. This will only change if more multi-core processors come to the mainstream, which is what AMD is doing with the Ryzen 5 and 7 series.

I’d like to see (and purchase) a 155+ watt APU with enough GPU performance to do VR and with a 4 core low power Ryzen architecture – all combined with HBM so as to save $$$ buying actual memory and also to get that sweet small form factor.

Although earlier the indications were that Apple was going to kill the MacBook Air line, a report now suggests that the company will launch an updated version of the Air at WWDC in June. Along with the new MacBook Air, Apple will also reportedly launch new 12-inch MacBook and an updated MacBook Pro, which will have a faster Intel processor. The repair about the new MacBooks come through Bloomberg , although India Today Tech had also earlier learnt that Apple was planning to introduce new Mac hardware at WWDC. Along with the new hardware, Apple is also expected to announce new version of iOS - iOS 11 - for the iPad and the iPhones, and updated macOS for its laptops and desktops. Also Read: MacBook Air, and not MB Pro, was best laptop Apple made and now it's dead If Apple indeed introduces a new MacBook Air at WWDC, this will come as a relief to the Air fans, and there are many of them. For the last three years, the Air has not been updated leading to speculations that it is destined for retirement. Interestingly the lack of update for Air means that it is now the only computer in Apple's product lineup that lacks a Retina display. All other laptops, and even iPads, come with high-resolution IPS screens while Air still sports the older TN technology and low resolution 900P screen. But despite its lack of a good screen, the MacBook Air continues to be popular among buyers. It is still remarkably superior to other laptops in its class and at a selling price of around Rs 55,000 is one of the best value for money computers in the market. In comparison, both the MacBook and the MacBook look somewhat over-priced. Also Read: iPad 2017 quick review: More affordable, less futuristic In fact, it is not just Air. The Mac has done well in the last two years even though Apple's bigger focus has been iPhone and iPad. In the latest quarterly results, Apple's balance sheet showed that Mac sales grew compared to the corresponding quarter last year even as the iPhone and the iPad sales show a dip. It seems that impressive Mac performance in the last few quarters has forced Apple to rethink its Mac strategy. In March Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that the company was investing heavily in Mac. "Revenue grew 14 per cent to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros," he had said after the company declared the latest quarterly results. "Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform."

AMD has announced Ryzen Mobile, its new processors for laptops. Not only that, we have a release window and the news that the company’s hotly-anticipated Vega architecture will form part of the new chips. At AMD’s Financial Analysts’ day, the company announced that Ryzen-based laptop processors would arrive in the second half of this year, which is what had been widely expected. Ryzen on desktop brought with it impressive processing performance at a cost that was very competitive with Intel’s all-conquering Core i brand. Related: Everything you need to know about Ryzen desktop processors While we expected Ryzen chips to come to laptops, the news that AMD’s Vega architecture will form part of the chips is very exciting indeed. Indeed, the company’s Chief Technology Officer, Mark Papermaster, promised “beautiful thin and light” laptops along with “AAA gaming performance”. Big claims, sure, but if AMD can pull of proper Full HD gaming performance in AAA games with a processor-GPU combo, it might be able to finally upset the Intel/Nvidia monopoly of gaming laptops. Exactly how much these fabled laptops will cost remains to be seen, as indeed does the performance. AMD Vega is the name for an entire GPU architecture, and it’s just as relevant to low-end graphics as it is to high-end. Related: Best gaming laptops What would be even more exciting is the super-long-awaited AMD thin-and-light ‘Ultrabook’-style device, which is something tech fans have been waiting for since, well, forever. Ryzen Mobile performance In terms of numbers, AMD is claiming 50% more CPU performance than its previous-generation '7th-gen APUs', 40% better graphics performance while managing a 50% cut in power consumption. These are all key ingredients to tackling Intel. But, of course, Intel won't be standing still. Computex 2017 is just a couple of weeks away, and we'd be surprised if the company didn't have a response. Will you be waiting for an AMD Ryzen laptop?

Microsoft's annual Build developer conference took place in Seattle's Washington State Convention Center this year from 10-12 May. This year, Microsoft chose to share all of its nitty gritty stuff on day one and reserved its more consumer-facing products for day two. There were a few underlying themes that stood out to me: artificial intelligence, cross-platform integration, an open source-feel and Microsoft urging developers to code on Windows for non-native apps. With Windows 10 now having 500 million monthly active users, the tech-giant wants to remind developers that it's worth investing time and effort into its products. From chatbots and apps for Microsoft Teams, to seeding AI through Azure stack, IoT Edge, and Microsoft Cognitive Services to provide a safer workplace for individuals on a construction site, this year's Build had a lot to offer. Here are some of the things that really caught my eye. Project Rome SDK for iOS developers This Microsoft project is a way for developers to connect their apps across devices. Previously aimed at Android developers, the functionality is now open to iOS developers, allowing a great way for those who want to test their apps in separate environments simultaneously to do so. This is achievable through the Xamarin Live Player, which will allow developers to debug and test iOS apps on a Windows machine. Cortana is now more useful than ever The somewhat unpopular AI assistant has been transformed into a cross-device, multi-purpose voice assistant. Used by 140 million users on a monthly basis, Microsoft encouraged developers to give more purpose to its AI software. Through a live demonstration, the company showcased how the voice assistant could work in companies collaborating through Microsoft Teams, or remind you that your connected car is out of petrol. An Amazon and Google speaker competitor was showcased too, the Harman Kardon's Invoke; a Cortana-based speaker. Microsoft also announced partnerships with both Intel and HP, which should also lead to more apps and products with Cortana integration. For developers, Microsoft announced its Cognitive Service and Bot Framework, which work together to allow an AI bot, like Cortana, to learn from user interactions. This makes conversational AI bots more life-like, a feature demonstrated by the Invoke speaker. Mixed reality developments On day two's keynote, Microsoft and the creative team from Cirque de Soleil showcased the benefits of using HoloLens by creating a virtual stage, live. This also demonstrated the ability to collaborate via HoloLens, no matter where you are in the world. However, that's not what got people excited – the Motion Controllers for Mixed Reality platforms did. Finally, just like the HTC Vive, you'll have controllers that will allow you to interact with the mixed reality headsets offered by Microsoft and its partners. The Acer $US299 and the HP $US329 dev kits were also announced at the event, which for a limited time will come bundled with the motion controllers. No Australian pricing, availability or individual pricing for the controllers was announced, though. Azure now works on mobile A feature that excited a few developers at the keynote was Azure's new mobile app, which will be available on iOS and Android. A Windows 10 UMP app is also in the works, which will let you keep an eye out for activities through your Azure dashboard while on the go. Azure IoT Edge is scalable and powerful In a live demo, Microsoft showcased the power of Azure IoT Edge, its cross-platform runtime. In the demonstration Microsoft put us in a construction scenario, with dangerous equipment and products on a construction site. Using connected security cameras with image recognition and inputted data sets, a manager is able to monitor people and tools on site. The real-time tracking and AI-based recognition completely transforms the environment by individually tagging each item, whether it's an object or a human. With 12 million organisations using Azure Active Directory, Microsoft is pushing for developers and companies to better its recognition capabilities and with 90% of the Fortune 500 on the Microsoft Cloud, I see this becoming a key tool for businesses. READ NEXT: Windows 10's next update revealed Azure Cosmos DB is out The service, previously known as DocumentDB, has received a healthy update. You'll now be able to visually see inputted values in a database, allowing you to quickly see a full reproduction of your data. Visual Studio is now on Mac Developers who code on Mac rejoice! Visual Studio for Mac means you'll be able to access Microsoft's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on Apple's operating system. It will work on mobile, web, Unity and Azure. Of course, you'll need to be a developer to access this, but I presume most looking at getting Visual Studio will already have that certified badge. PowerPoint can now translate Following on from the unveiling of Skype Translator back in 2014, Microsoft has added a similar new feature to PowerPoint. With the help of AI, the presentation software can now translate your slides in real-time. Sure, it isn't flawless, but the room and myself were all impressed at how quickly and accurately it could translate spoken Spanish to written English. There are currently ten languages available, with more to come.

Thanks, Google Waze 1 Data Center HPC Cray dips toe in supercomputing-as-a-service Gene research a test market for cloudy graph engine 17 May 2017 at 01:03, Richard Chirgwin With AWS, Google, and IBM's Watson already camped in the high-performance cloud business, it's hardly surprising that Cray would tread carefully as a late entrant into the supercomputer-as-a-service business. The premium-level HPC vendor has decided to start small both in terms of target market and in geography: it's inked a deal with US data centre operator Markley to run genomic and biotech workloads for customers in just one bit barn located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The service is based on Cray's Urika-GX appliance, latest in a line of big data monsters introduced in 2012. Urika's architecture is specific to graph applications: massively multithreaded, with a heritage that reaches back to spookdom before Cray allowed it to reach the public. The Urika-GX landed last year, with Intel E5-2600 v4 processors (up to 48 nodes and 1,728 cores), 35TB of PCIe, the Aires high-speed interconnect, and 22TB of on-board memory. It's pre-installed with OpenStack and Apache Mesos. The hardware spec is nice, but it's the Cray Graph Engine the company hopes will convince super-shy gene researchers the service is better for them than running up a super service from one of the existing clouds. Cray's head of life science and healthcare told The Register's HPC sister publication The Next Platform a Cambridge sequencing centre that tested the offering hit a “five times speedup on parts of their overall workflow” compared to a standard cluster. If you consider this as a beta to a limited market, it's hardly surprising that Cray hasn't announced pricing yet – nor that for now, it looks more like a “time-share” model than a fully-cloudy offering, with access to the supercomputer-as-a-service booked through Markley. One reason for picking Markley's data centre as the first home for the service is its connectivity, on a local basis, to major networks. The company claims more than 90 carriers and network providers have a presence in the facility. That's important for potential customers, because they will (naturally enough) have to upload their data to the service before the resident supers can get busy crunching data. So users can pre-test their data and scripts before pressing “go” on an expensive supercomputer run, there's a virtualised Urika GX. For storage, Markley will offer a suitable array in the colo (if customers have their own storage in the facility, they can use that instead). ® Tips and corrections 1 Comment MORE Cray Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Nvidia's supercomputer-in-a-box needs 3.2kW of juice 4 Comments UK, you Cray.

Apple could release MacBook updates soon Posted 10 hours ago by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook teams up with The Trevor Project for LGBTQ youth suicide prevention According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is about to release updated MacBook and MacBook Pro models. The company could announce the refresh at its WWDC keynote on June 5. The 12-inch MacBook with a retina display hasn’t been updated in a year. The design still works quite well, so I wouldn’t expect anything more than a specification bump. Maybe Apple is going to add a second USB-C port. That would be nice as it’s a bit frustrating that you can’t charge your device and plug something at the same time without a dongle. The keyboard isn’t as good as the one in the most recent MacBook Pro either. When it comes to the MacBook Pro with the new Touch Bar, it’s still quite new but Apple likes to update its computers regularly with better CPU options, more RAM and storage. In particular, the MacBook Pro missed the mark for Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. The laptops shipped with Skylake CPUs, but there’s no reason not to update the laptops with the new CPUs. More surprising, Bloomberg is saying that Apple is also considering updating the MacBook Air. Based on Apple’s own press conference, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without a touch bar is the perfect MacBook Air replacement. It’s roughly as heavy as the 13-inch MacBook Air, but it’s still more expensive. That’s why the MacBook Air is still around for the time being. But Apple could even go a step further and refresh the MacBook Air with better components. I wouldn’t hold my breath for this one. WWDC is a developer conference, so Apple focuses mostly on software news for its developer community. This year should be no different. You can expect some news around iOS 11, tvOS 11, watchOS 4 and macOS 10.12. At the same time, developers use Macs every day, all day. So it would make sense to spend a minute talking about minor Mac updates. Mac users are also waiting for brand new iMac and Mac Pro models. But those devices aren’t ready just yet. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Intel Developer BLORPs Older Hardware, May Help With Some Bugs Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 May 2017 at 08:59 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's Mesa BLORP code has been ported to older "Gen 4" and "Gen 5" integrated graphics hardware, allowing more common code to be used going back to the i965 IGPs. The BLORP blit framework has been part of Mesa since the Sandy Bridge days and with time has ended up being used by every generation of Intel graphics hardware since for surface state management. But the pre-SandyBridge hardware had never been ported to BLORP until this new port by Intel developer Jason Ekstrand. With this patch series of 43 patches [1551 insertions, 1033 deletions], BLORP is brought to Intel Gen 4/5 hardware. Ekstrand does a nice job explaining it at the beginning of the series: When Sandy Bridge came out, surface state management suddenly became significantly more complicated because of HiZ, MSAA, and separate stencil. In order to deal with all of these complications, Paul Berry write BLORP which is a blit framework that's capable of handling all of the exotic cases we have to deal with in a modern Intel driver. As time went on, blorp was ported to Ivy Bridge and then Haswell. At Broadwell, we tried to get away from blorp but eventually decided that having one more copy of state setup wasn't so bad compared to dealing with meta so it was brought forward to gen8-9. However, it has never been back-ported to gen4-5... Until today! Why should we do this? For one thing, it's actually less code. The patch which actually adds gen4 support to blorp is around 300 LOC. If you add on the patch which adds SF program support, you get another 50. On the other hand, the meta PBO upload path is 450 lines of code all by itself and that doesn't include the DD table entry or the code we have to carry in i965 to support it. Secondly, it lets us unify a bunch of gen6 and gen4 stuff. You can already see in this series that I delete an entire blitframebuffers implementation because we were carrying 2 just so gen4-5 could have its own. This series doesn't actually get everything converted over but it does convert enough that I'm reasonably confident that it all works. In the process, this series fixes 12 tests: 2 on ILK, 2 on g45, and 8 on i965. While older Intel graphics hardware doesn't get much Mesa graphics driver love, it's nice to see this BLORP porting effort and hopefully will help some users stuck on this older graphics hardware. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

And he told me that probably four or five years ago,” Napolitano told the FOX Business Network on Monday. Scalia died in his sleep in February 2016 while on a hunting trip at a luxury Texas resort. He was declared dead of natural causes amid speculation of foul play. Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America’s independent news network. Napolitano was discussing allegations U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and another senator were under surveillance by the Obama administration. “If they had to unmask Senator Paul’s name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that,” Napolitano began. “That’s not what he’s talking about. They’re talking about unmasking him when he’s having a conversation with his campaign manager when he’s running in the Republican primary.” Unmasking is the revealing of names within the intelligence community of U.S. citizens whose communications were monitored during foreign surveillance. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Napolitano said former President Obama could be subpoenaed to testify if he viewed the unmasked intelligence. Paul announced May 4 he had asked the intelligence community and White House for any evidence that he was surveilled by Obama. “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!” Paul tweeted. The tweet, the Hill reported, appeared to build off of Trump’s controversial claim that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower during last year’s presidential race. Spike in unmasking WND reported an official government report released last month indicated the Obama administration requested the unmasking of almost three times as many Americans under surveillance during the election year of 2016 than during the year before. The report, “Statistical Transparency Report Regarding Use of National Security Authorities,” contains a chart that shows the identities of 1,934 Americans were unmasked upon requests made by the Obama administration in 2016. That was nearly triple the number of those unmasked upon request the year before, 654. The report was prepared under Obama’s director of National intelligence, James Clapper, who served in that position from August 2010 until January 2017. The report refutes Clapper’s denial to Congress that his agency spied on U.S. citizens. Clapper answered, “No,” when asked, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” In addition, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, in a PBS interview March 22, denied any knowledge of the unmasking of associates of candidate and President-elect Trump, collected in foreign surveillance. Two weeks later, however, she was identified as the Obama administration official who requested the unmasking of incoming Trump administration officials on several occasions. As WND reported, Rice implicitly acknowledged she was not telling the truth when she did not deny the reports in a subsequent interview with NBC.

As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 …to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 Trump’s tweets Tuesday notably lack any mention of whether the information he shared was classified. And the remarks appear to contradict statements made by his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster — who told reporters in the wake of the report that the story “as reported is false” — and White House deputy national security adviser for strategy, Dina Powell, who said Monday “the story is false. The President only discussed the common threats that both countries faced.” Trump shared highly classified information with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador to the US in a White House meeting last week, The Washington Post first reported Monday. Two former officials knowledgeable of the situation confirmed to CNN that the main points of the Post story are accurate: The President shared classified information with the Russian foreign minister. Trump did not directly reveal the source of the information, but intelligence officials told CNN that there is concern that Russia will be able to figure out the highly sensitive source. The White House dismissed the report Monday night, issuing several statements before sending McMaster before White House reporters. “At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the President did not disclose any military operations that weren’t already publicly known,” he said. “I was in the room. It didn’t happen.” Soon after Trump defended his handling of the Russia meeting, he then reiterated his longstanding call to find leakers in the intelligence community, saying he had called on former FBI Director James Comey and others to investigate “from the beginning of my administration.” Intel analysts outraged Early responses to the bombshell report indicate that, if true, handling sensitive details in this manner would have broad implications on US partnerships around the world and could place the lives of agents in the field at risk. “Never before have I witnessed a senior government official so carelessly threaten an intelligence-sharing relationship,” a former senior intelligence official told CNN. Mark Hertling, a national security, intelligence and terrorism analyst for CNN, said giving Russia information has not historically led to them being forthcoming with the United States. “I’m concerned about the fact that the President feels like he has to give something to Russia first when there have been repeated instances of Russia being sanctioned in Ukraine, committing war crimes in Syria and conducting operations that are contrary to what we’d like to believe are freedom of operations and sovereignties of different nations,” he said Tuesday on CNN’s “New Day.” “This confuses me to no end.” Phil Mudd, a former CIA analyst, said on “New Day” the fact that Trump chose to discuss classified information but did not ask Russia about its role in the 2016 election is problematic. “This isn’t the biggest news out of that meeting,” he said. “Why is nobody talking about the President feels the responsibility to be more courteous to the Russians than to the American people.” “He didn’t talk about election meddling,” the CNN counterterrorism analyst added. “It’s his first face-to-face with the Russians and the secretary of state and the President can’t say, ‘You shouldn’t be meddling in our election’ but he can fire Comey for investigating that? You’ve got to be kidding me.” The potential consequences could hardly be more serious, former CIA case officer Bob Baer told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday night. “The President, by revealing this to the Russians, has lost control of this information. It’s going to go to the Syrians, It’s going to go to the Iranians — Russian allies,” Baer said. “The ability to protect that source whoever he is, wherever he is has been seriously undermined … If a CIA officer had revealed this information to the Russians, he would be fired instantly.” Leon Panetta, a former secretary of defense and CIA director, said Trump had a responsibility to be more careful with sensitive information. “He is President of the United States. He is not a reality TV star. He is not just another personality. He is President of the United States,” he said Tuesday on “New Day.” Putin requested meeting The Wednesday meeting between Trump, Lavrov and Kislyak had already raised alarm bells in Washington, primarily because it came one day after Trump decided to fire Comey while the bureau investigated his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. The meeting, a personal request from Russian President Vladimir Putin — who asked that they meet when he spoke with Trump earlier this month — was supposed to remain behind closed doors without any media coverage. But a photographer from Russian state-media Tass attended the meeting and took photos of a laughing Trump with Lavrov and Kislyak. No US media were allowed into the meeting. Though an angry White House official told CNN they felt “tricked” by the Russians, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said “proper protocol was followed” by not allowing media into the meeting. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump slammed Hillary Clinton for storing classified information on her private email server. “Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ‘were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,’ Trump tweeted in July. “Not fit!” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

USA TODAY National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster takes a question from a member of the news media, beside White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, during a press conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 16 May 2017. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA) 1398 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 70 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON –  If the commander-in-chief gives sensitive information to people without security clearances, can everyone else know it, too? It seems the answer is no. Revelations that President Trump may have revealed highly classified intelligence to Russian diplomats this week dominated headlines in Washington this week. Yet any classified intelligence Trump reportedly passed on to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in their Oval Office meeting would remain classified for everyone else, secrecy experts say. If there was no formal, written change in the classification status of the information, "no one else in the administration would have any reason to believe that it was no longer classified,” said Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy. A government lawyer would argue that, because this was a private meeting, a disclosure by Trump "did not serve to declassify the information," said Mark Zaid, an attorney specializing in national security matters. "The mere fact that it then appears in the papers, either specifically or generally….none of that serves to declassify any of the information unless an authority in the U.S. government acknowledges it," Zaid said. Presidents have broad authority to disclose classified information. Even though every other government employee with a clearance risks criminal charges for revealing classified information without permission, Trump has the power to unilaterally disclose any material without any formal process. Trump on Tuesday defended his "very, very successful" meeting with the Russians. "As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety," Trump tweeted.

The reports from the Washington Post and others sparked an onslaught of criticism that the president may have jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State terror group, as well as the willingness of allies to share information with the United States. National security adviser H.R. McMaster declined to say Tuesday whether the information Trump shared in the Oval Office last week was classified. “We don’t say what’s classified; what’s not classified,” he told reporters. “What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation," McMaster said, "and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged." Notably, though, neither McMaster – nor Trump himself – has denied the president shared classified information. And the idea that the information itself is still classified was reflected in initial reports Monday night. While the Post reported the intelligence in question had to do with Islamic State plans to use laptop computers as weapons and was so sensitive it had been withheld from allies and even some parts of the U.S. government, the newspaper withheld the name of the partner country that provided the information and other key details. Officials, they said, warned them against publishing the information could hurt intelligence capabilities.

Even so, members of Congress are trying to get a transcript of the exchange, so the information may inevitably spread more widely. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the White House to give the congressional intelligence committees — which have security clearances — a transcript of the exchange. “We need the transcripts to see exactly what the president said, given the conflicting reports from the people in the room,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Until the administration fully explains the facts of this case, the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation’s most closely kept secrets.” The White House hasn’t said what record of the exchange exists, though it's mentioned in the Post story. Aftergood said it’s more likely that the transcript referred to in news reports is not from a recording but from an official note-taker at the meeting. “It would be logical for the congressional intelligence committees to request a copy of the full transcript in order for them to fully evaluate what took place,” he said. There are some rules on the books outlining the unauthorized release of classified information. The executive order setting the official procedures for classified information requires anyone who thinks classified information to be compromised to “immediately report the circumstances to an official designated for this purpose.” A 2013 analysis by the Congressional Research Service concluded that executive branch policy appears to treat unofficial releases of previously classified information to have no effect on the classification status. But it's clear the White House does not see Trump's release of information as the problem. Instead, they criticized the leaks of classified information that generated the news coverage as the main national security threat. "I think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this," McMaster said. "And as you know, there are a number of instances where this has occurred. And I think it's important to investigate these sort of things, and to make sure that we have trusted organizations across our government that allows for the free sharing of information and collaboration." Zaid didn't see it that way. Trump appears to be acting impulsively to share sensitive information without understanding the consequences, he said. He pointed to McMaster's earlier comments that Trump hadn't been briefed on the source of the information he shared – which the New York Times reported on Tuesday was Israel – as an example. While McMaster meant that as a defense of Trump's actions, Trump is "now one of the most dangerous threats to our national security," Zaid said. "He's taking actions unilaterally without understanding the national security apparatus and how intelligence works."

The story was first reported by The New York Times. Sen. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee and who recently announced his retirement from Congress, said that "on the surface that seems like an extraordinary use of influence to try to shut down an investigation." "If the memo exists, I need to see it and I need to see it right away. We are drafting the necessary paperwork to get the memo so we will find out in a hurry if it's out there," Chaffetz told NBC News. Later in the evening, he wrote to the acting director of the FBI seeking the memo and related information saying that if Comey's allegation is true, it indicates Trump may have sought "to influence or impede" the FBI investigation of Flynn. Related: Oversight Committee Chair Chaffetz Demands All FBI Documents on Trump, Comey Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, reportedly said at a dinner Tuesday night that the controversies have reached a "Watergate size and scale," according to Daily Beast correspondent Tim Mak. McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo later said "Senator McCain's comments tonight were simply meant to convey that the constant revelations of events surrounding Russia's interference in the 2016 election are reminiscent of past scandals, are not good for America, and require further scrutiny." Tarallo said McCain continues to call for a select committee to investigate alleged Russian interference and all the events surrounding it. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Republican in a swing district in Florida, had harsh words for the White House. "If this is true, it is disconcerting and it opens up a new chapter of scandal and controversy in this country," he said.

"Of course Director Comey should testify. I believe an open, transparent government is most effective for the people we represent," said GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House leadership team. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said he is determined to find out more about what's been going on. "These latest reports further underscore the need for us to get a better understanding of the events that led to Michael Flynn's removal. "Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified that there has been no effort to impede the FBI's investigation, which seems in conflict with the reports about a Comey memo," he added. "As I've said before, we need to get the facts out in the open, and that includes getting answers to our questions to the FBI and reviewing any memos related to the matter." Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said on Twitter: "Congress needs to see the Comey memo." But Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was skeptical of the report. "As close as (Sen.) Mark Warner and I have worked with the director over the past many months now, I actually believed the director might have told us if there had been a request like that (from Trump). And it was never mentioned by him," Burr told reporters, adding that he and Sen. Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, met with Comey the day before he was fired. "I'm getting really, really tired of anonymous sources," Burr added. A spokesperson for Burr said that while the committee hasn't seen the memo mentioning Trump's attempt to halt the investigation, "It certainly raises questions and he will follow up on acquiring those facts from credible sources."

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been withholding judgment of Trump's meeting with Lavrov, said that this is now more reason for Comey, who was fired exactly one week ago, to come testify. "If Comey is alleging president did something inappropriate, there is an open invitation for him," Graham said. "Don't want to read it in a memo, I want him to say in person." The latest developments have renewed focus on Democrats' call for a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation. "This stunning, breathtaking revelation that the president is accused of reaching out directly to the head of the FBI to stop an investigation on General Flynn under these circumstances raises serious questions of obstruction of justice," Senate Democratic Whip Richard Durbin said.

May 17, 2017 blogsonjapan Source: East Asia Forum Author: Andrew Kennedy, ANU In March, Apple announced it would establish two new research and development (R&D) centres in China, to accompany two other centres it announced last year. In doing so, Apple joined a growing list of US high-tech companies that have established an R&D presence in China over the past two decades, including Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Intel. Americans have long worried about the offshoring of US manufacturing jobs to China — fears that Donald Trump exploited to become President. So is the United States on the verge of becoming reliant on China for R&D as well? The answer is no — for several reasons. First, while US corporate R&D is globalising, it is doing so very slowly. Between 2000 and 2010, for example, the share of US corporate R&D performed within the United States fell from 88 per cent to 84 per cent. The very gradual nature of the shift reflects a number of constraints: the complexity of managing global R&D networks, how embedded multinationals are in their home countries, and the local infrastructure and intellectual property protection that core R&D can require, among others. Second, US firms conduct R&D in many countries around the world …continue reading      BLOG CATEGORIES ALL BLOGS BUSINESS CARS CULTURE EDUCATION FOOD JOBS SCI-TECH SOCIETY TRAVEL J-INFO Japan Weather City Guide All Japan Tours DHgate Japan Fashion PromoCodeWatch.com 7 Binary Options: Robots Search for: CONTACT US ADVERTISING TWITTER RSS iPhone App (Free) iPad App (Free) Android App (Free) NEWS CATEGORIES BUSINESS ECONOMY EDUCATION POLITICS SCI-TECH SOCIETY SPORTS TRAVEL 日本語 BLOG CATEGORIES BUSINESS CULTURE ANIME-MANGA MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES EDUCATION JAPANESE TEACHING FOOD JOBS SCI-TECH SOCIETY TRAVEL Kyoto NAVIGATION NEWS Society Business Education Sci-Tech Travel Economy Politics Sports 日本語 BLOGS Business Cars Culture Education Food Sci-Tech Society Travel Music / Talk CONTACT US ADVERTISING TWITTER iPhone App (Free) iPad App (Free) Android App (Free)

The White House pulled an audible on Tuesday to have McMaster address press in the White House briefing room. Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s previously scheduled briefing was been moved to an off-camera gaggle later in the afternoon.

McMaster: “The president wasn’t even aware of where this information came from.” pic.twitter.com/Q9C7FT62mz — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 16, 2017 Earlier Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to say he had the right to share “facts” with Russia but did not address reports that the information was classified. The Washington Post on Monday reported that Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian officials during a White House meeting last week. The information, which was provided by a U.S. partner, was apparently so sensitive, some details have been withheld from allies and restricted even within the U.S. government. The Post quoted former and current U.S. officials, who said Trump’s disclosures “jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State,” and the story was quickly matched by a variety of news organizations. McMaster first dismissed the report, calling it “false,” during a quick statement shortly after the Post published the news. “I stand by my statement that I said yesterday,” McMaster said on Tuesday. Last week’s meeting, which included Trump, Russia’s ambassador Sergei Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, was closed to the media except for a Russian photographer. Photos from the meeting sparked a media firestorm after they were published by Russian state media. The Post reports that Trump’s disclosure could have severe consequences because the partner who passed on the intel did not give the U.S. permission to share the material with Russia. Officials quoted in the story said Trump’s decision to reveal it to the Russians “endangers” cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. “This is code-word information,” a U.S. official familiar with the matter told the Post, referring to one of the highest classification levels used by American intelligence agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” *Related stories from TheWrap:* Trump Admits Sharing Terrorism Intel With Russia: 'I Have the Absolute Right' National Security Adviser Denies Trump Leaked Classified Intel: 'It Didn't Happen' Donald Trump 'Revealed Highly Classified Information' to Russian Officials (Report) » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - 9 hours ago< > Embed Trump Disclosure A Breach Of Trust, If Not Law 00:34 President Donald Trump didn't appear to break any law by sharing highly classified information with Russia, but that doesn't make it any less problematic for America's intelligence agencies and their overseas partners.

Unnamed sources said Apple will bump the processor in its MacBook Pro to Intel’s Kaby Lake. The company will also introduce a faster MacBook and maybe even a faster MacBook Air. Mr. Gurman is almost always right, and I hope he nailed it with this one. Updated MacBook Pros just 10 months after they were introduced would go a long ways to convincing us that Apple is as committed to the Mac as it says it is. The same goes for the other two models.

(Published Tuesday, May 16, 2017) A Massachusetts woman is being held without bail after Brockton Police say she went on a crime spree on Monday. Police say 28-year-old Anisha Johnson's spree started at 8 a.m. Monday. She faces multiple charges in the series of incidents. Woman Arrested for Assault, Property Damage and Robbery Authorities say a light brown, 2005 Chevy Trailblazer was first blocking a woman in her driveway with her vehicle, who was attempting to leave from work. Johnson is then believed to have exited her vehicle before punching one victim in the face and driving away.

NBC Boston spoke with the victim over the phone Tuesday, and she said she is recovering. The description she gave to police matched another incident, in which a victim reported a similar car striking her own vehicle before fleeing the scene. Police said the second incident happened at 8:24 a.m. at the Speedway Gas Station on North Main Street in Brockton.

As police arrived and prepared to arrest the suspect, an officer walked up to the Trailblazer, but the suspect took off in her vehicle missing the officer by inches. Police pursued the suspect onto Route 24. The chase lasted for an hour, finally ending just before 4:30 p.m., when Johnson was apprehended at the exit 17A off-ramp.

The second incident brought charges of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage. In the third, she is charged with unarmed robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon for attempting to hit the victim and operating to endanger. Johnson faced a judge at Brockton District Court Tuesday, where she told a doctor she was delusional and off her medications. She was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation before a dangerousness hearing next month.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Analysis Long live the laptop. Long live the Apple-Microsoft rivalry Kevin Kelleher May 16, 2017 3:25 PM Above: Apple chief executive Tim Cook. Image Credit: Apple There may yet be life in the laptop market. A few weeks after Microsoft launched its long-promised, fully fledged Surface Laptop, Apple is reportedly planning to refresh its Macbook lineup. Apple’s anticipated announcement followed last fall’s update of the Macbook Pro, which left many enthusiasts underwhelmed. Apple will upgrade the Macbook Pro and the 12-inch Macbook with faster processors, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. In particular, the Macbook Pro will get a quad core processor using Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture, which wasn’t available when the Macbook Pro relaunched last October. In addition, Apple is said to be considering a faster chip for the 13-inch Macbook Air. The new laptops will be announced at Apple’s developer conference next month, according to Bloomberg. The competing offerings from the longtime personal-computing rivals suggest a brighter future for laptops than was on the horizon even a few months ago. The new Macbook Pro received mixed reviews upon its announcement, with some enthusiasts — especially professionals who relied on its processing power — feeling that it fell short of their expectations. Instead of a new Touch Bar that seemed nice if not necessary, they wanted the speed and power Macbooks have always offered. And rather than delivering the fancy upgrade that Macbook Pro users had waited 524 days for, Apple had signaled that it may be moving away from laptops in a personal-computing landscape where smaller devices were dominant, at least in terms of sales. Reports inside Apple seemed to indicate that Apple was focusing its innovative talent on other areas. The new Macbooks certainly have revived growth in Apple’s Mac division, but nothing like the glory days. The new Macbook Pros began selling in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2016. Overall Mac unit sales, which also include desktops, rose one percent to 5.4 million for the quarter while Mac revenue rose seven percent. In the most recent quarter, unit sales rose four percent to 4.2 million while revenue rose 14 percent. Macbooks and Mac desktops have long had a outsize role for Apple. Together, they make up only 11 percent of Apple’s revenue, but inside any Apple store they take up a much larger portion of its floorspace. The same could be said of Apple’s brand: The Mac stands at the center of Apple’s storied history, especially in its long battle against Microsoft, and it still holds a big part of the consumers’ mindshare. So if Apple does refresh its Macbook lineup next month, it will be announced around the time the Surface ships on June 15. The Surface, which features Intel’s Kaby Lane processor, seemed to win more positive initial reviews than the Macbook Pro update last fall. Granted, the bar of expectations has long been higher for Apple than for Microsoft — especially considering this is Microsoft’s first laptop — but after its release the Surface began to look like a viable alternative to the Macbook. The arrival of a Surface Laptop also underscored a change in Apple’s marketplace. Deep-pocketed giants like Microsoft and Alphabet are moving into manufacturing, if not branding, their own hardware. Apple’s lead in design and innovation remains secure. But just as Microsoft has made strides with the Surface, Google has gained momentum with its Pixel phone. Amazon is working with manufacturers to market 4K TVs that use in-house-designed software and its popular Alexa technology. Refreshing its Macbook lineup certainly would help Apple maintain its lead over Microsoft. Even though the laptop’s glory days may be past, there’s nothing like a little competition from a well-financed competitor to return Apple’s focus to its high-end laptops. Given Apple’s history in personal computing, it would be ironic if that competition came from Microsoft.
